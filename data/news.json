Harry has gained an awful lot of experience with this club. Casemiro leaving is another one and we have to understand what that means.”\n\n\n\nMaguire, 32, has been a standout performer under Carrick, but was also a key player under Ruben Amorim earlier in the season before injuries.\n\nAsked if Maguire is the best form of his career: “There is a case (for that), as your career goes when you’re a young player and everything is fresh, you’re fearless and there’s not many scars there.\n\n“You get to your peak years and you feel good and everything is there, but you’ve had a few ups and downs.\n\n“You get towards the later times and the experience should make you a better player, we’ve seen that with Harry’s performances of late.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\n“That’s why experience is important, I felt it when I was playing, 31 or 32 were my best years of being in that sweet spot to do it physically still but use the experiences to know what is coming.”\n\nMaguire is in the final five months of his deal at Old Trafford and it is unclear at this stage what the future holds for the record defensive £80m signing.\n\nUnited triggered a one-year extension in Maguire’s contract in January 2025 at the behest of then-manager Ruben Amorim.\n\nCarrick also said “there was no timescale” on Matthijs de Ligt‘s return, but sources told SunSport the defender was aiming for a March comeback in some capacity.\n\nDe Ligt, 26, has missed the last 15 games due to a lower back problem sustained in United’s 2-1 win at Palace on November 30.\n\n\n\nMason Mount, who scored the winner at Selhurst Park, and Lisandro Martinez are also ruled out of United’s game against Palace at Old Trafford on Sunday."

It’s more something I do to help people, a passion to help people with their money. I like to help people and make other people’s dreams come true.\n\n“I was always thinking about how I was going to live my life, because in football you never know if it’s going to work out or not.\n\n\n\n“I focused myself on finance, finance, finance.”\n\nThe Full Arsenal on YouTube SunSport have launched a dedicated Arsenal channel on YouTube!

The Hoops crashed out of the Europa League against Stuttgart on Thursday night, with a respectable 1-0 victory in Germany not enough to overturn their hefty 4-1 first-leg deficit.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCeltic now face two Old Firm clashes against Rangers at Ibrox in the space of a week, between a trip to Aberdeen. The club will be aware that anything short of two wins over their fierce rivals will lead to increased fan scrutiny over why more was not spent on strengthening the squad this season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Premier Sports in Ireland during coverage of the Stuttgart clash, Lennon appeared to align himself with disgruntled supporters, pointing to Brendan Rodgers ' departure as evidence of an issue within the club. However, the 54-year-old stopped short of calling for a Bodo/Glimt-style fairytale, insisting fans should not expect Celtic to consistently perform well in European competition.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Something was not right in the summer in terms of the recruitment. I don't know what it was,\" Lennon said. \"There were some grievances with Brendan, who was definitely disconnected and you could see the reasons why at the end. There's no director of football at the minute, that needs to be addressed.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n\"Overall, the recruitment has been disappointing. You're not going to get it right every year, but I do add value to some of the fans' questions as to why they didn't spend more money or bring more quality in.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNottingham Forest Europa League match stopped after one minute as player confronts crowd READ MORE :\n\nChampions League paths to final become clearer after draw as Arsenal and Liverpool learn routes READ MORE :\n\n\"Certainly with Carter-Vickers being out, he's been a big loss. They knew he was out long-term but didn't bring a mature centre-half in to complement Scales. They might have tried to do that, January is always a tough window.\n\n\"There are valid questions to be asked of the board. But over the piece, over the past 15 years, the board's record has been impeccable.\"\n\nHowever, Lennon disagrees that splashing the cash on new signings could transform Celtic into European giant-slayers in the mould of Norwegian outfit Bodo, who have defeated Manchester City, Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan to reach the last 16 in the Champions League.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Celtic were on that run last year,\" Lennon continued. \"So you're not going to get it every year.\n\nView 2 Images Lennon has had two spells as Celtic manager (Image: Ian MacNicol, Getty Images)\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Bodo/Glimt is maybe an exception to the rule this year. They have their own way of doing things. The salary cap, you can't do that at Celtic. They've just got Norwegian and Danish players. (If Celtic wanted to do that), they'd just have to reset and just sign Scottish and Irish players.\n\n\"And then they'd have to have a four or five year plan. Are the fans going to be willing to sacrifice domestic dominance to build a team for Europe in four or five years time?\n\n\"That's the question. These questions were asked about Midtjylland as well. Everyone's going on about the structure of Celtic... since 2000, they've had three last 16s and a Europa League Final. When we got to the last 16 in 2012, the following summer we sold Wanyama, Hooper and Kelvin Wilson. Because it's not sustainable.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The other thing is, clubs who are successful get assets stripped. For Bodo/Glimt, can they keep Knutsen? Will there be clubs coming in for their players? And can they then replace that? That's what Celtic try and have to do year in year out.\"\n\nHowever, when asked why Celtic aren't investing more money on new players, Lennon admitted: \"I don't know the answer to that, to be honest with you.\n\n\"It's difficult to attract £10m, £12m, £15m players to Scotland unless you're guaranteed Champions League. That's in my own experience. If they'd have qualified against Kairat, I imagine they'd have spent a sizeable amount of money on the squad.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Maguire has played a key role in the team since Carrick became head coach last month and has recovered superbly from a chastening period of poor form that saw him lose the Manchester United captaincy.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe manner in which Maguire has quietly gone about his rehabilitation has earned him plenty of plaudits. And Carrick, whose fine start to life as United head coach has propelled him into contention to land the role permanently, has made it clear how highly he thinks of the England defender.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAsked about Maguire's contract situation, Carrick said: “Within the squad there is that balance, you want that younger potential and excitement and helping develop player, you need the sweet spot in the middle with players at the peak and experience is massive. It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Casemiro leaving is another experienced one. It's something we've got to obviously understand and what that means.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMaguire became the most expensive defender in football history when he joined in an £80million transfer from Leicester City back in 2019. After struggling during Erik ten Hag's premiership, he is now back performing at the top of his game and has started in all six of the games Carrick has overseen as head coach.\n\nView 2 Images Maguire has played a key role under Michael Carrick (Image: Visionhaus)\n\nCarrick was asked if Maguire was now better than ever and the former Middlesbrough boss again referenced the defender's experience in what could be perceived as another hint towards his stance on retaining Maguire beyond the current campaign.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“There is a case, as your career goes when you’re a young player and everything is fresh and knew your fearless and there’s not many scars there,” he added.\n\n“You get to your peak years and you feel good and everything is there, but you’ve had a few ups and downs. You get towards the later times and the experience should make you a better player, we’ve seen that with Harry’s performances of late. That’s why experience is important, I felt it when I was playing, 31 or 32 were my best years of being and that sweet spot to do it physically still but use the experiences to know what is coming.”\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The 'Process' is over, and the mandate is now binary: deliver a major trophy or be tarred as an Arsenal failure.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs harsh as that might sound for someone who hauled the Gunners out of the post-Wenger wilderness and into title contention for the first time in nearly two decades, there's no getting away from it: winning the Premier League or the Champions League is no longer an aspiration. It's the bare minimum expectation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFor Arsenal, the Champions League draw was, quite frankly, kinder than the smile on N'Golo Kante's face. A round of 16 encounter with Bayer Leverkusen leads into a quarter-final against either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting CP - a sequence that feels more like a pre-season tour than a European knockout gauntlet.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the last four, their biggest threat is an inconsistent, cash-strapped Barcelona side, with the very real possibility of facing Premier League stragglers Tottenham or Newcastle instead. Meanwhile, the real monsters - Real Madrid, Manchester City, Liverpool, PSG and Bayern Munich - are all safely cordoned off on the opposite side of the bracket.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nPremier League clubs' Champions League hopes ranked after nightmare draws READ MORE :\n\nChampions League paths to final become clearer after draw as Arsenal and Liverpool learn routes READ MORE :\n\nThis is, without a doubt, Arsenal's greatest-ever chance to claim the trophy that has eluded them forever - the absence of which has long made them the punchline of domestic rivals. For Arteta, the maths is simple: a draw this favourable doesn't just invite success, it demands it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. While Gunners fans couldn't have wished for a kinder path to the final in Budapest on May 30, the draw has effectively stripped Arteta of his greatest safety net: the underdog narrative.\n\nHe is now forced to split focus and resources between two competitions he is categorically expected to win. Failure in either would no longer be a valiant effort; it would be a giant blot on his record, another blown chance, another 'bottle job.'\n\nAs strange as it sounds, the Spaniard might have preferred being tossed into the bracket of death. A quarter-final exit to Real Madrid or Man City would sting, but it would be explainable, excusable. Particularly with the club so desperate to break a 22-year Premier League title drought, a loss to a titan offers a convenient 'out.'\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The Champions League draw for the 2025/26 knockout rounds (Image: Kristian Skeie - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)\n\nWithout it, Arteta is facing the ultimate Catch-22. He is compelled to chase both trophies with equal fervour, but that very ambition could be his undoing.\n\nOn one hand, he stands on the precipice of the greatest season in Arsenal's history - a potential Double that would eclipse even the Invincibles. On the other hand, he is a slip or two away from a collapse that would turn Arsenal's brightest campaign in decades into a hollow, haunting disappointment, cementing a legacy defined not by how far he climbed, but by the ceiling he couldn't break.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSlips-ups, after all, have been plaguing Arsenal recently. Having won just three of their last eight Premier League games, the north London club have seen a commanding seven-point New Year's Day lead whittled down to a precarious gap. If City win their game-in-hand, their cushion vanishes entirely.\n\nIn any other year, Arteta would narrow his focus to steadying Arsenal's wobbling domestic form. But prioritising the league over Europe is no longer a luxury he can afford.\n\nView 3 Images Mikel Arteta will now be under pressure to win both the Premier League and the Champions League (Image: Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTo win one while letting the other slip would be a tragedy of missed opportunity. It would leave a campaign of historic magnitude - potentially the club's finest in a generation - overshadowed by a bitter, nagging sense of 'what if?'\n\nBut therein lies the trap. If he spreads his resources too thinly in a desperate bid for immortality, Arteta will risk total systemic failure. He could find himself not only empty-handed at the end of the season, but permanently branded as the manager who - despite having the world at his feet - simply could not get it done when it mattered.\n\nIt's a quandary of Shakespearean proportions. There's no middle ground left, and yet middle ground is all Arteta has left to stand on. This season will either be Arsenal's greatest triumph or a fumble so catastrophic that the Spaniard may never recover.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe 'Process' era is over. The 'Trophy' era must now begin. This is the ultimate litmus test for Mikel Arteta: win big now, or walk away with a legacy defined by 'almost'."

            "content": "Michael Carrick has issued two Manchester United injury updates ahead of the Premier League clash against Crystal Palace. Mason Mount and Matthijs De Ligt are two of the notable absentees for United, with Carrick on hand to issue new fitness verdicts on both.\n\nHe said: \"Mason (Mount) is getting closer, he’s on the grass, he’s looking to train and be around it. We’ve just had to be patient, really. Matthijs (De Ligt) has had a back issue, which has been a little bit sore to progress, really. He’s heading in the right direction.\"\n\nOn the latter, Carrick added: \"It’s the nature of the injury, the issue in the back, it’s a difficult one to pin down time wise. He’s definitely improving.\" De Ligt has been unavailable since early December, with his last appearance coincidentally the reverse fixture against the Eagles.\n\nMount, meanwhile, has missed the last few weeks but looks set for a return soon given Carrick's update. Having not played since late January, the English midfielder is more likely to return next Wednesday away at Newcastle as opposed to this Sunday's visit of Palace.\n\nLisandro Martinez is one player that could be back this weekend, though, despite picking up a recent injury which saw him miss Monday's 1-0 win over Everton with a calf injury. Carrick revealed before that clash that it was a minor injury and it did not look too bad.\n\nLeny Yoro came in for the Argentine and performed admirably alongside Harry Maguire with Senne Lammens also in inspired form behind them. Bryan Mbeumo hobbled off at Hill Dickinson Stadium earlier this week but has since been training and, with no mention of injury by Carrick, looks to be fine.\n\nIt is likely to be another few more weeks before Patrick Dorgu is back in action, however, with the Denmark international recovering from a hamstring injury.\n\nDespite having no European or cup fixtures remaining this season, United are set to play twice in four days, with game week 29 of the Premier League brought forward by a few days to accommodate the FA Cup fifth round.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

Given City have managed to get the better of their Spanish opponents on a few occasions recently, it’s not as daunting as first thought.\n\nThey will certainly be hoping that they will face either Atalanta or Galatasaray in the following rounds, however unlikely that may be.

The neighbours have both made the England and Nottingham Forest star one of their main transfer targets.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnderson has emerged as one of the best midfielders in Europe since joining Forest from Newcastle for £35m in 2024. The 23-year-old has gone on to establish himself in the England team - and will be part of Thomas Tuchel's World Cup plans this summer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited and City are both keen to strengthen midfield this summer - and will find themselves in a bidding war for the £75m-rated ace.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Anderson would want to have his future decided before heading to the tournament.\n\nBut he knows his stock will be even higher if he helps England succeed in North America. Anderson knows he could be relegated with Forest this season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut whatever happens, he will have his pick of top clubs and believes he is ready to take that step up to the next level.

Anderson has refused to be drawn on his future and remains focused on helping Forest beat the drop.\n\nHe said: \"It’s been a big two years. I think I’ve done pretty well, to be honest, in the time I’ve been here, on and off the pitch.\n\n\"I think I've matured as a person as well.

            "content": "Ahead of a busy Saturday filled with quality racing, the Weekend Winners team discussed their best bets for Newbury, Doncaster and Kelso.\n\nThe panel of Kate Tracey, Sam Boswell and Declan Rix paid special attention to Newbury's BetVictor Greatwood Gold Cup Handicap Chase - which is live on Sky Sports Racing at 3.45pm.\n\nVincenzo and Twinjets are towards the head of the market for this contest over two miles and four furlongs, which was won in sensational style by Booster Bob last term at the expense of the former.\n\nDeclan Rix\n\n\"It's obviously a competitive race. There's a combination of horses that have been walloped for wins last time out and horses who are not well-handicapped. I kept going further and further down and ended up with Josh The Boss for two reasons.\n\n\"Firstly, he's a novice and is unexposed to a degree over fences. He's had more runs than I've had hot dinners this year. This will be his seventh start of the season. He is backing up after running at Newcastle last week but he clearly takes his racing well. He jumps well for a novice and I thought last time out he had the run of the race and jumped well aside from nodding on the back of four out.\n\n\"His old nemesis Prairie Wolf will not be in to beat him this day and although it's a worry that he won't be able to dominate this field, I do believe he wants a good, even gallop over this trip because he'll probably stay a little further. If he's bounced out of the race alright, with Jamie Neild taking 7lbs off he has got a handicapping chance.\"\n\nKate Tracey\n\n\"Vincenzo is a standout for me, he looks as if he's got so much more to come. Last time out at Ascot he won by two lengths from Bad. It was a messy race overall but it was really good form in terms of talented horses and a testament to him that he can still produce this kind of effort, sticking to his task really well after hitting the front at the last.\n\n\"He's only been given a 2lb rise for that and I thought that was very fair and he could be even better going back left-handed, which suits him really well. I hope he's got plenty more mileage in his mark.\"\n\nSam Boswell\n\n\"The good news about Heltenham, if you like him like I do, is he loves it around Newbury. He's had one bad run from about six efforts, with three wins and a second to his name. His second was on seasonal reappearance this year against Twinjets. He got beaten by 10 lengths but there's a stone in favour today in favour of Heltenham, which is a massive plus point.\n\n\"I know we don't get the services of Harry Skelton but these are the types of races they're winning en route to a championship and Heltenham is going to be a massive plus point through the spring. He obviously went up against Jonbon last time, which was effectively a run to get round - he managed that.\n\n\"I do hope going back to his favoured Newbury will bring out the best in him. Charlie Todd has ridden the horse before to reasonably good effect when finishing third. We're a double digit price and he's an each-way play, I don't know why he won't be all out to take a really valuable prize.\"\n\nWatch Weekend Winners in full on the At The Races YouTube channel..."

Two years on from a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Lille in the Conference League, the two sides meet again.\n\nPantomime villain Emiliano Martinez starred on that day, saving the decisive penalty after avoiding a red card midway through the shoot-out, despite receiving his second booking of the game.\n\nTrademark celebrations soon followed as he soaked up the animosity from the French crowd. That, coupled with his antics from the World Cup triumph with Argentina over France, could create quite the cauldron at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy when he returns.\n\nImage: Emi Martinez celebrates Aston Villa's ECL victory over Lille in 2024\n\nVilla will be tasked with replicating the same success over two legs to continue their quest to end their 30-year wait for a trophy and if they do achieve that, the drama won't stop there.\n\nA meeting with Roma and on-loan striker Donyell Malen could then await, should they be successful in the tie against Bologna. UEFA rules state no team can influence what line-up their opponent selects and that would allow Malen to face off against his parent club in a bid to dump them out of the competition.\n\nPorto, Nottingham Forest, Midtjylland and Stuttgart make up the rest of that side of the bracket. Villa were undoubtedly handed a harder route to glory; the storylines running alongside it just add to the drama.\n\nWhen will fixture dates be announced?\n\nThe last 16 match schedule will be available on Friday night.\n\nThe quarter-finals and, in principle, the semi-finals match schedule will be communicated on March 20.\n\nHome advantage in second legs for seeded teams\n\nThe top eight teams from the league phase in both competitions are seeded and will have home advantage in the second leg of their round of 16 games.\n\nThis will extend to the quarter-finals for the teams that finished in the top four of the league phase if they progress.\n\nThe top two will also have home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final if successful.\n\nAny team that eliminates a seeded team will take their privileges.\n\nWhen are the 2025/26 knockout stages?\n\nRound of 16: March 12 and 19\n\nQuarter-finals: April 9 and 16\n\nSemi-finals: April 30 and May 7\n\nFinal: May 20\n\nWhere are the finals?\n\nThe Europa League final will be held at Besiktas Park in Istanbul on May 20.\n\nThe Conference League final will be one week later at the Leipzig Stadium on May 27."

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

The 5.30pm kickoff comes during the current holy period when Muslims fast between sunrise and sunset. On Saturday sunrise is at 6.59am and sunset is at 5:44 p.m. Among City’s frontline players, Omar Marmoush, Rayan Ait-Nouri, Abdukodir Khusanov and Rayan Cherki are Muslim. Guardiola was asked if their fasting would affect his selection for the match. “No, they take care and they know how you handle these situations,” he said. It is thought there will be a break at 5.44pm at Elland Road to allow any fasting players on either side to take in nutrition. Share\n\n18m ago 09.29 EST Crystal Palace: Ahead of that game at Old Trafford, Oliver Glasner has been garlanding Michael Carrick with praise: “Of course, when Man United plays at home against Crystal Palace, everybody there is expecting now a win. They are a very good team now. They gave a very good balance between, it’s a very experienced team, with really, very experienced Premier League players, and very young players with huge talent. “It’s a good mix they have now, but I think the most important thing for them is they are consistently playing with their team and have a clear structure in the way they are playing. This is what I could see against Everton. They have a great spirit right now. It was really impressive seeing Matheus Cunha celebrating winning a duel in their own box. This, I think, is what Michael Carrick brought into this team.” Share\n\n20m ago 09.26 EST Manchester United: Michael Carrick on Harry Maguire’s contract running down. “Within the squad, there is that balance, you want that younger potential and excitement and helping develop players, you need the sweet spot in the middle with players at the peak, and experience is massive. “It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be. Harry has gained an awful lot of experience with this club. Casemiro leaving is another one, and we have to understand what.” United play Crystal Palace on Sunday at Old Trafford. Share\n\n34m ago 09.12 EST Champions League draw: Rosenior also commented on Chelsea pulling PSG in the last-16 draw. “So excited. PSG are a fantastic team. I have experience of playing against them in France. I have always admired them. Luis Enrique has done an incredible job. These are the games you live for, games that you come into football for. It’s going to be a great tie. But we’ve got another three games before that, that I need to focus on.” Share\n\n37m ago 09.10 EST Chelsea: Liam Rosenior has been talking about the racist abuse on social media Wesley Fofana received after last week’s draw with Burnley. “It was a tough day for Wes. First for what happened in the game and the racist abuse he got online. It affects you in ways that shouldn’t exist. It’s something we have to try and erradicate from life and football. He is strong and has trained this week.” “Players have incredible support on and off the pitch. Social media is part of the younger generation - it’s the way they communicate and the way they live. In a perfect world, players don’t take notice of what’s on social media but they do. I hope that the players that are on it realise it’s just noise. It’s people with opinions. Some are valid and some come from a place that is not a good place.” Share\n\n48m ago 08.59 EST That’s enough from me. Here’s John Brewin to see things through. Share\n\n1h ago 08.42 EST Jamie Jackson With regard to Mikel Arteta’s bid to get Arsenal over the title-winning finishing line after three consecutive second-place finishes, Pep Guardiola was asked for his recollections of doing so with Barcelona in 2008-9, his first season as a head coach. The reply was pithy. “I don’t remember. I’m not here to give advice to Mikel,” said the Catalan. Share\n\n1h ago 08.38 EST David Moyes is giving James Garner plenty of love. The Everton manager reckons Thomas Tuchel should take note. “He’s predominantly a midfield player but can play several positions,” said Moyes. “We had to play him left-back at the start of the season in a couple of games when we didn’t have anybody available. We’ve had to put him at right-back at different times because we think he’s as good as anybody there. In midfield he’s been excellent. I actually believe he’s getting close to being the levels to play for his country. So hopefully he can keep that up and could possibly get selected.” Share\n\n1h ago 08.30 EST Ben Fisher Nottingham Forest need goals if they are to avoid relegation and who better to provide them than Chris Wood, who racked up 20 last season? Only Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah and Alexander Isak outscored Wood in the last Premier League campaign. Now there is increasing optimism that Wood could feature in Forest’s run-in, an April return mooted. Vitor Pereira, the Forest head coach, said of the striker: “Yes, I hope [he can] recover as soon as possible, because this is very important for us. The information that I have is [that he is] working hard to come as soon as possible.” The 34-year-old has not played since October and underwent knee surgery at the end of last year. The New Zealand captain is desperate to return to fitness before the summer’s World Cup. His last Forest goal came in a home defeat to Midtjylland, who Forest have been drawn against in the two-legged round of 16 next month. Forest travel to Brighton, one of Wood’s former clubs, as they return to league action on Sunday. Share\n\n1h ago 08.22 EST Palace faced AEK Larnaca at home in October … and lost 1-0.

No, me neither. Share\n\n2h ago 07.49 EST Scottish Premiership: Danny Rohl has reminded Luke McCowan that Rangers are ahead of Celtic in the title race after the Hoops midfielder confidently claimed: “We know if we’re at it no team in that league touches us”. McCowan asserted his belief after the Parkhead side’s 1-0 win over Stuttgart in Germany on Thursday night saw the reigning William Hill Premiership champions lose their Europa League play-off 4-2 on aggregate. Ahead of the Glasgow derby at Ibrox on Sunday and with 10 fixtures remaining, Rangers are four points behind leaders Hearts and two ahead of Celtic, who have a game in hand over the leading pair. “I think at the moment we are in the second position, they are behind us,” said Rohl, upon being asked for a reaction to McCowan’s comments. “They have at the moment seven or eight defeats. I think in general it makes no sense to speak too much about the other side, we have to focus on ourselves. “We want to win this game. I see my team is ready to take points and then we’ll see on Sunday. Hopefully both teams try everything and I’m confident that we have a big chance of winning this game.” [Press Association] Share\n\n2h ago 07.23 EST Europa League Round of 16 draw Ferencvaros v Braga\n\nPanathinaikos v Real Betis\n\nGenk v Freiburg\n\nCelta Vigo v Lyon\n\nStuttgart v Porto\n\nNottingham Forest v Midtjylland\n\nBologna v Roma\n\nLille v Aston Villa As Villa and Forest are in the same half of the draw, there is no prospect of an all English final.

The two clubs have already faced each other once in the group stage, with City coming from behind to win 2-1 in December. Defending champions Paris St Germain will face Chelsea in what will be a repeat of last year’s ill-tempered Club World Cup final where the Premier League side came out on top. Arsenal, who finished top in the league phase, play Bayer Leverkusen while Bayern Munich, who were second, play Atalanta. Newcastle United face Barcelona while Liverpool take on Galatasaray. Premier League strugglers Tottenham Hotspur face Atletico Madrid while Norwegian side Bodo/Glimt – who have beaten City, Atletico and Inter Milan (home and away) this season – take on Portuguese side Sporting. [Reuters] Champions League last-16 draw: Manchester City face Real Madrid, Chelsea get PSG Read more Share Updated at 07.43 EST\n\n3h ago 06.33 EST First impressions: It’s a nice draw for Arsenal, who will play one of the weakest sides in the competition (other opinions are available) and face Bodo/Glimt or Sporting if they advance to the quarter-finals. Manchester City will play Bayern Munich or Atalanta if they can get past Real Madrid. We will have a Chelsea v Liverpool quarter-final if they both qualify, while Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur could meet in the last eight but both sides have an awful lot of work to do to make that happen. Finally, would anyone in their right mind confidently bet against Bodo/Glimt seeing off Sporting to set up a potential quarter-final against Leverkusen or Arsenal?

The Egypt international has won the Golden Boot four times since arriving at Anfield in 2017, the latest in last season’s title-winning campaign but has gone nine league matches without finding the net. It’s his worst run in the English top flight but Slot said while the criticism was to be expected because of the 33-year-old’s high standards it was not a cause for a concern as it was a problem afflicting all his forwards. “He set his own standards and those are so high and the moment he doesn’t score for a few games people are immediately surprised – that is the biggest compliment he can get,” said Slot. “With data you can use it to your advantage or disadvantage but not to use the FA Cup game – if we play a Premier League side - you could argue if that is fair. “Three games ago he had an assist and a goal against a very good Premier League team in Brighton so that is the reality and then you can change data and say he did not score in nine Premier League games. We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and at this moment in time that is maybe the biggest difference in his performance and game time. But we also know this has happened before, I don’t know if it happened nine games in a row but I’ve had these questions earlier if he didn’t score for three or five but I know in the end he always starts scoring again. He is not our only attacker at this moment in time that doesn’t score as much as we are used to.” [Press Association] Share\n\n4h ago 05.24 EST Football Association news: Kevin Thelwell has been appointed the FA’s Elite Coach Developer, tasked with supporting the progression of elite homegrown coaches.

Arne Slot has opened his pre-match presser by telling reporters that Florian Wirtz will not be fit for the game and there’s no confirmed time frame on the German’s return. Wirtz missed Liverpool’s somewhat fortuitous win against Nottingham Forest last weekend after being forced to pull out during the warm-up. “I don’t expect Florian to be available,” he says. “It’s a disappointment. Every time a player is not available is a disappointment, it’s something that I didn’t expect after last week. At this moment time, I don’t know [when he will return]. Usually when I say that, I do know and I don’t want to share. But this time, I honestly don’t know. “It’s a big accomplishment for Wirtz to stay fit for such a long time because he had to make a step up from where he played to the Premier League and Liverpool. It tells a lot about his mentality and work rate that he has stayed fit for so long. It is a disappointment for him and for us, because he has played really, really well lately” Slot also reveals that Jeremie Frimpong will be available for tomorrow’s match after being sidelined since the end of January.

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts have revealed.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot insisted it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said of putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down-to-earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one-v-one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "THE CLASS(IC) SYSTEM\n\nLa Liga has El Clásico, France has Le Classique, and Argentina goes full gun with its Superclásico. English football has no true equivalent, with Liverpool and Manchester United fans unable to agree on a name for their grand-slam meetings. Up in the land of fitba, there’s this weekend’s 450th Old Firm/Glasgow derby (delete as applicable according to your stringency on Scottish company law). And Germany has Der Klassiker, between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. The Bundesliga marketing suits have been out in force this week for the one game, played on Saturday evening, that brings extra eyeballs. Though questions are often raised over whether this is a true, classic rivalry; Dortmund have not won a league title since Jürgen Klopp was making his rounds in 2012.\n\nSince then, Bayern have celebrated a league title with lashings of weissbier outside the Rathaus every year save for 2024, when Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen went unbeaten to wear the crown. Dortmund v Bayern, is it a historic rivalry? Well, not really, since Bayern’s dominance of the Bundesliga goes back to 1968-69, when they succeeded Eintracht Braunschweig and Nürnberg as champions. The 1970s took in Borussia Mönchengladbach as their chief rivals, what with Günter Netzer, Allan Simonsen and all that.\n\nIt was not until the mid-90s that Dortmund, with two domestic titles and a Big Cup in 1997 (run Lars Ricken VT) realised the dreams of their vast fanbase. Here is where the needle began, with a spat between all-round nice guys Lothar Matthäus and Andy Möller in 1996 and then Oliver Kahn’s flying kick on Stéphane Chapuisat before biting Heiko Herrlich’s ear in 1999. All good stuff if you want to build up a deep-seated rivalry. After near-bankruptcy followed their 2002 Bundesliga triumph, it took Klopp’s heavy-metal thunder for Dortmund to upend Bayern. Since then, while FC Hollywood strut to repeated titles, Dortmund have become football’s leading kindergarten, a finishing school rather than a credible challenger.\n\nThis season, Bayern are eight points clear of Dortmund at the top, and only a win at the Westfalenstadion will prevent another procession. “For me, it’s always a title in its own right, even if people say we can’t win anything more now,” roared Vincent Kompany, ever the hype man. “These games are also important to the masses.” Kompany’s Bayern face a Dortmund team probably unable to believe what happened against Atalanta in Bigger Cup, Ramy Bensebaini’s swinging heel into Nikola Krstovic’s head a moment to have them waking up screaming in the night for decades. What might also keep Dortmund coach Niko Kovac awake is the prospect of facing Harry Kane, living up to the standards set by Robert Lewandowski in modern times and Gerd Müller in Bayern’s first golden era, scoring 45 goals in 37 matches for club and country this season. Truly best in class.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Tom Bassam at 8pm GMT for red-hot Premier League minute-by-minute updates on Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n“It’s not looking to the style now at this moment. The style needs to be in the second moment, because now it’s a question of life and death if I can say that in that way sportingly” – Igor Tudor, there, channelling Bill Shankly as he explains why Tottenham might not be wowing the league with whizzy play as they fight for top-flight survival.\n\nView image in fullscreen Igor Tudor: maybe he’ll talk about socialism next week. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\ndouble quotation mark I just hope the hapless Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini (yesterday’s Football Daily) does not follow my path. I too was directly responsible for four opposition goals in one game: one came from my taking a corner that curved behind every one of my teammates, allowing five of the other lot to advance on our puffing centre-back; another was me slicing a clearance so badly that instead of arcing down the touchline, it went at 90 degrees, landing at the feet of an opponent with enough time and space at the edge of our box for his own Grand Designs project. I never again played any form of competitive sport” – Michael Hann.\n\ndouble quotation mark I feel compelled to point out that Ramy Bensebaini played left-sided centre-back of a back three against Atalanta rather than left-back (yesterday’s Football Daily). I noticed this because of the body language of his teammate Daniel Svensson each time Bensebaini recklessly served a goal up on Wednesday. Svensson was the recovering left wing-back at the Algerian’s side, head bowed and shoulders increasingly drooping” – Matthew Parham.\n\ndouble quotation mark I’ve come to the conclusion that the collection of words at the bottom of Football Daily’s full email edition (that rarely makes any sense to me) are a form of the popular location app what3words and give the venue of that evening’s secret ‘drinks’ for the hard-working hacks. It hasn’t escaped me that, when there are more than three words, my theory sheds more water than something that sheds water” – Shaun.\n\ndouble quotation mark Regarding yesterday’s last line ‘Hot Parents’ Chat Ahoy’ (full email edition), am I the only one wondering if it is the chat or the parents that are hot?

Only Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal have had more injuries, and those clubs have deeper squads.\n\nScott will take charge of an overhauled medical department, with the existing head of medical, Dr Prithish Narayan, understood to be leaving to return to work for the NHS.\n\nScott left Tottenham at the start of last season as part of a major restructure of Postecoglou’s backroom team, which led to the appointment of Adam Brett from Brighton as Spurs’ director of performance services. It was widely reported at the time that Scott had clashed with Postecoglou over the players’ workload and management of their recovery, with Tottenham declining to comment.\n\nTottenham’s squad has been devastated by injuries for the last two seasons under Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, with the club experiencing 41 injuries last season leading to 1,553 days out, the second-highest total in the Premier League after Brighton.\n\nForest have been drawn to face Midtjylland in the Europa League last 16.

            "content": "Michael Carrick has hinted that Harry Maguire will be offered a new deal with Manchester United and believes “there’s a lot more to come” from the defender.\n\nMaguire’s contract runs out in the summer and he has yet to sign a new one, but there is optimism at Old Trafford that he will stay at the club he joined for £80m in August 2019. United host Crystal Palace on Sunday, aiming to extend their six-match unbeaten run under Carrick. They have only dropped one point in that period, with Maguire’s value to the interim head coach seen by the fact he has started every fixture of his tenure.\n\n“Harry’s an impressive character. He’s had a great career so far, hopefully there’s a lot more to come,” Carrick said. “The journey and the experiences that he’s had, certainly since he’s been here and with England as well, showed exactly what he is. I think we all know the player that he is and what he’s capable of doing.\n\n“The other night [against Everton] I thought he was fantastic. Experience helps. His attributes help, and his character. His willingness to put himself out there. He’s really impressive at his age and he’s been really important for us.”\n\nThe 32-year-old has not always been universally popular since arriving from Leicester but has rediscovered his best form in recent weeks. It is likely that Maguire will need to take a wage reduction to remain at the club, but following the announcement that Casemiro will leave at the end of the season, there is an eagerness to keep some experience around the squad.\n\n“Within the squad there’s always that balance,” Carrick said. “You want that younger potential and that excitement of developing players and helping players. but you need that little sweet spot in the middle where the play is at the peak. You need that within the group and experience is massive. It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be, whether that’s individuals or experience as a whole group.”\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe is keen to keep costs down and wages is a key part of it, especially after it was revealed in a filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday that the sacking of Ruben Amorim and his staff could cost the club up to £16m. United said in a November 2024 filing they were paying Sporting £10m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m. The combined changes around Amorim’s appointment could cost United £36.3m."

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland. Louise Taylor\n\nLeeds v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Daniel Farke will be hoping for more celebration as Manchester City come to Elland Road.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "Lionel Messi was briefly tackled to the ground by a pitch invader and a security guard in a midweek, early-season friendly on Thursday evening in Bayamón, Puerto Rico.\n\nInter Miami were fulfilling a make-up date for a postponed friendly against Ecuadorian club Independiente del Valle, originally slated for 13 February. The initial date was scrapped after Messi had felt discomfort in his hamstring during the preceding tune-up exhibition at Ecuadorian side Barcelona SC. Inter Miami cited coordination with “the event promoter and the government of Puerto Rico” in determining the makeup date of 26 February – five days after Miami opened the 2026 MLS season in Los Angeles, losing 3-0 to Son Heung-min’s LAFC.\n\nMiami will resume the young MLS regular season less than 72 hours after Thursday’s friendly, paying a visit to intra-state rival Orlando City on Sunday evening.\n\nThe match itself was a curious spectacle for reasons other than the odd timing. Kickoff was delayed a full hour, per reports on the ground, due to issues with uniforms; ultimately, both Independiente del Valle and Miami wore majority-black kits, making the teams difficult to tell apart from a distance.\n\nIn front of a sold-out crowd of 12,500 at the Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel, Miami coach Javier Mascherano began the match with a lineup mostly composed of players who didn’t start the season opener in Los Angeles, but assured the media before the match that his entire squad could feature. Messi entered at half-time, ultimately scoring a penalty kick in a 2-1 win.\n\nIn the 88th minute, fans rushed on to the field from behind Miami’s goal, with one pitch invader running past Rodrigo De Paul before converging towards Messi. A security worker forced the fan to run past the Argentinian, but two more young fans (one in a Barcelona shirt, the other a Miami jersey) followed suit asking for a selfie and an autograph.\n\nEventually, the now-shirtless initial invader outran the security guard and hooked back towards Messi, wrapping his arms around his waist. The security guard then tackled the fan to the ground, taking Messi down with him inside the center circle. A bemused Messi quickly rose to his feet, walking away unscathed.\n\nNone of his Miami teammates came to intervene on their captain’s behalf during the chaotic sequence and its aftermath. Eventually, an opposing player (Carlos González, a Paraguayan striker) approached Messi and wrapped his arm around him as security and the officiating crew sorted through another smattering of onrushing fans.\n\nLike Miami, Independiente also opened their campaign last weekend, winning 2-0 in LigaPro against Guayaquil City. They resume competitive play on Monday, away at Manta FC."

            "content": "SAINT'S DAY Who was St David and what is St David’s Day?\n\nSAINT David’s Day is a traditional celebration dedicated to the miracle worker and saint of Wales, St David.\n\nAlthough it is not a public holiday, it has been celebrated across Wales since the 12th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nWho was Saint David?\n\nSaint David – or Dewi Sant in Welsh – is generally considered to have been born some time between 462 and 515AD and was the grandson of Ceredig, King of Ceredigion.\n\nAccording to legend, his mother, named Non, gave birth to him on a Pembrokeshire clifftop during a fierce storm.\n\nAfter being educated in Cardiganshire, he went on pilgrimage through south Wales and the west of England, where it is said that he founded religious centres such as Glastonbury and Croyland.\n\nHe even went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, where he was made an archbishop.\n\n\n\nSt David eventually settled at Glyn Rhosyn (St David’s), in south-west Wales.\n\nMany miracles have been attributed to him.\n\nThe most incredible of these was when he caused the ground to rise underneath him so that he could be seen and heard by all, according to Rhigyfarch who wrote about him towards the end of the 11th century.\n\n\n\nWhen is St David’s Day 2026?\n\nThis year, Saint David’s Day will be celebrated on Sunday, March 1.\n\nWales celebrates St David’s feast day on the exact same date annually, in honour of their patron saint.\n\nSt David is believed to have died on March 1 in 589 AD, which is why it became St. David’s Day.\n\nThe feast was not regularly celebrated until he was canonised by Pope Callixtus II in 1120.\n\nPeople can be seen wearing daffodils and leeks, symbols of Wales and St. David.\n\n\n\nWelsh rarebit, cawl and Welsh cakes are eaten throughout the day, with many towns and cities throwing parades too.\n\nWhy do we celebrate St David?\n\nSt. David’s last words to his followers came from a sermon he gave on the previous Sunday: “Be joyful, keep the faith, and do the little things that you have heard and seen me do.’\n\nHe was buried at the site of St David’s Cathedral, where his shrine was a popular place of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nThe phrase “Gwnewch y pethau bychain mewn bywyd” – “Do the little things in life” – is still a well-known maxim in Wales.\n\n\n\nFrom this period on, he was frequently referred to in the work of medieval Welsh poets such as Iolo Goch and Lewys Glyn Cothi.\n\nIn 1398, it was ordained that his feast day was to be kept by every church in the Province of Canterbury.\n\nThough the feast of St David as a religious festival ended with the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, the day of his birth became a national festival during the 18th century.\n\nWhat symbols are associated with St David’s Day?\n\nOn St David’s Day, many people in Wales pin either a daffodil or a leek to their clothes – as the Welsh have two national emblems.\n\n\n\nThe tradition of eating and wearing leeks on St David’s Day supposedly goes back to the sixth century.\n\nAlthough many associate St David with leeks or daffodils, his personal symbol is actually the dove, after one was said to have rested on his shoulder during a miracle.\n\nSt David was a teetotal vegetarian reputed to have consumed only leeks and water but the association likely pre-dates him.\n\nLeeks were hailed by Druids as a cure for the cold, protecting soldiers against wounds in battle, and even for keeping away evil spirits.\n\nEntries in the household accounts of the ‘Welsh’ Tudor Kings of England, record payments for leeks worn by the household guards on St David’s Day.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the fourteenth century, it is known that the feared Welsh archers adopted the green and white colours of the leek for their uniforms, perhaps at the Battle of Crecy, explains Historic UK.\n\nIn 1346, when the Prince of Wales, Edward the Black Prince, defeated the French at the Battle of Crécy, Welsh archers reportedly fought bravely in a field of leeks and as a reminder began to wear a leek in their caps every St David’s Day.\n\nDaffodils, which are in bloom around this time of year, have only become another national symbol for Wales in the 19th century.\n\nWales Online explains that St David’s feast day became a national festival during the 18th century.\n\nIt states: “By that time the leek had become a bit of a caricature and this may explain why daffodils became a popular alternative.”\n\n\n\nHow is St David’s celebrated?\n\nThe traditional meal on St David’s Day is a soup made of lamb, leeks and other vegetables known as cawl.\n\nThe day is celebrated with country festivals and dances – all with a dragon-theme – which take place across Wales on St David’s Day.\n\nImages of red dragons are used to celebrate because the dragon features on the Welsh national flag and is often considered a symbol of the country.\n\nChildren in Wales take part in school concerts or eisteddfodau, with recitation and singing being the main activities.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe flag of Saint David often plays a central role in the celebrations and can be seen flying throughout Wales.\n\nUnlike St Patrick’s Day in Ireland, St David’s Day is not a national holiday, though there is strong support for it becoming a bank holiday in Wales."

James Comer said Hillary denied knowing Epstein and responded with, “I don’t know, you’ll have to ask my husband” to multiple questions.\n\nThe former secretary also briefly addressed Maxwell’s appearance at her daughter Chelsea’s wedding for the first time.\n\nRead More on Epstein Probe CLINTON CLASH Hillary Clinton Epstein testimony descends into chaos after picture leaks\n\nAfter the testimony, she told reporters that the convicted sex offender, who was photographed at Chelsea’s wedding, was attending as a “plus-one.”\n\nShe added that the end of the hearing took a strange turn when lawmakers asked about UFOs and the Pizzagate conspiracy, which she called “vile.”\n\nThe testimony was briefly brought to a halt after Rep. Lauren Boebert leaked a photo from inside the closed-door hearing.\n\n\n\nComer said the former president should expect to face an even tougher questioning.\n\n“We have a lot of questions for her husband tomorrow, and I’m confident that deposition will last even longer than this one,” he said.\n\nBill Clinton is set to testify about the disturbing pictures released of him with Epstein, as well as his trips on the sex trafficker’s plane.\n\nClinton has previously denied a longstanding relationship with Epstein.\n\n“I have nothing to hide, I’ve been exonerated, I have nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein,” he told reporters earlier this month.\n\n\n\nHowever, a trove of photos released by the Justice Department in December show Clinton cozying up with Epstein.\n\nOne image shows the former president relaxing in a pool with Maxwell and a mystery woman.\n\nAnother shows Clinton lounging in a hot tub with an unknown woman, whose face was redacted.\n\nOne bizarre image shows a painting of the former president sporting a blue dress and red heels hanging inside Epstein’s Manhattan home.\n\nA separately released set of images shows Clinton receiving a shoulder massage from Chauntae Davies, an Epstein accuser, during a 2002 trip.\n\n\n\nThe former president has also acknowledged flying on Epstein’s private jet four times in 2002 and 2003.\n\nClinton spokesman Angel Ureña blasted the photo release, saying, “They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn’t about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be.”\n\nThe former president will be deposed in Chappaqua, New York, where the Clintons have a home.\n\nClinton’s deposition will be the first time a sitting or former president will be deposed before Congress since Gerald Ford appeared before a Senate subcommittee to discuss plans for the bicentennial of the Constitution in 1983.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nNeither Bill nor Hillary Clinton has been charged with wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.\n\n\n\nEpstein died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial, and Maxwell is serving a 20-year federal sentence."

            "content": "IT was the Green Party’s finest electoral hour, romping home in the Gorton and Denton by-election to upend British politics.\n\nYet, they stand accused of opening the Pandora’s Box of sectarianism to achieve the stunning result in what was one of the most toxic polls in recent times.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent observers claimed to have witnessed “extremely high” cases of illegal “family voting” in the south Manchester suburb with a high Muslim population.\n\nThis is the practice when family members enter a voting booth together and one tells the other how to vote.\n\nIt can involve a husband and wife and is a criminal offence.\n\nNigel Farage rounded on the Greens – who ran on a pro Palestine ticket – insisting theirs was a victory for “sectarian voting and cheating”.\n\n\n\nThe Reform UK leader said that family voting presented “serious questions” about the integrity of the ballot in “predominantly Muslim areas”.\n\nDemocracy Volunteers – the poll observer group accredited by the Electoral Commission – said they had seen “the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10-year history of observing elections in the UK”.\n\nManchester City Council have insisted “no such issues have been reported”.\n\nReform’s Gorton candidate Matt Goodwin, who finished second to the Greens, said: “I am deeply concerned about the extent to which the Gorton and Denton by-election is a free, fair, and democratic election.”\n\n\n\nYet, the Green’s success in Gorton – their vote was up by a staggering 28 per cent from 2024 – suggests their style of campaigning may be here to stay.\n\nTheir success follows the election of four independent MPs on a pro-Gaza platform in the 2024 general election.\n\nThe Greens tailored their message to the more than a quarter of potential voters in the constituency who are Muslim, with almost a fifth of whom are believed to have roots in Pakistan.\n\nThey published electoral videos and leaflets in Urdu, the national language of Pakistan.\n\nCampaign leaflets featured a photo of their candidate Hannah Spencer wearing a red and black keffiyeh – a scarf worn by supporters of the Paletinian cause – while posing in front of a mosque.\n\n\n\nWritten in English, the material included the words: “Stop Islamophobia. Stop Reform.”\n\nAnd, in Urdu, the leaflet stated: “Labour must be punished for Gaza.”\n\nWhat are Green Party’s bonkers policies? From ‘disgusting’ plan to legalise heroin to letting in ALL illegal migrants THE Green Party has been blasted for “disgusting” plans following their bombshell victory last night. Fighting for his political life yesterday, Sir Keir Starmer made a last minute attack on the Greens in an attempt to sway voters. But it was unsuccessful, with Labour coming third – and the result provided an opening for Andy Burnham‘s allies to claim things could have been different if he had been allowed to stand. The Greater Manchester Mayor – a challenger to Starmer – tried to stand in the constituency but was blocked by Labour’s ruling executive committee. The Gorton and Denton result signals a serious cracking of Britain’s two-party politics, with Reform and the Greens gaining more power and validity. But it has cast a light on the policies of both parties – with the Greens coming under fire for plans on drugs and immigration. Yesterday, Sir Keir came out swinging and told PMQs: “The Green Party’s policy isn’t just irresponsible, it’s reprehensible, legalising cocaine, heroin, ketamine and the date rape drug, GHB, a drug which we know is used to spike drinks for women. “I have to say, as the father of a 17-and-a-half-year-old son, that the idea that the argument is being made by the Greens that when he turns 18, in just a few months, it would be lawful to provide him with heroin and crack cocaine is absolutely disgusting.” Green candidate Hannah Spencer has previously said she thought “decriminalising is a conversation that we need to have”. Last year, the leader of the Greens said that all drugs – including heroin and crack cocaine – should be legalised. The Mail has also reportedly seen documents drawn up by the Greens that suggest giving amnesty to illegal migrants. It reported that Zack Polanski plans to let illegal arrivals use the NHS from the moment they land in the UK as part of a “world without borders”. This would apply even if their asylum claim was rejected. Internal documents read that “migration is not a criminal offence under any circumstances”, the Mail reports. Detention centres for illegal migrants would also be abolished in the plans. The Greens would also give them a wage on the level of benefits – but without the usual requirement to be in work or actively seek work. Reform, Labour and the Tories all blasted the scheme as “financially reckless but also dangerous”. Other Green Party plans include Net Zero by 2040, dismantling nuclear weapons, and more tax rises for earners above £50,000.\n\nWhile leaked text messages from the Gorton and Denton Green campaign showed party activists planning to leaflet Muslims “outside mosques” during Ramadan.\n\n\n\nAnd a Green campaign video pictures Sir Keir Starmer clutching the hand of India’s Hindu Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a bitter foe of Muslim Pakistan.\n\nThe campaign tactics led to accusations that the Greens were sowing division and sectarianism.\n\nA senior cabinet minister said before the vote: “The Greens are whipping up hatred and deliberately raising the salience of Gaza.\n\n“They’re hammering us. They’re a totally different party to the one we thought they were.”\n\nBefore voting day I met Labour candidate Angeliki Stogia in ethnically-diverse Longisight.\n\n\n\nThe Network Rail worker told me: “Stoking anger outside the mosques here isn’t going to solve the problems in Gaza.\n\n“I‘m very disappointed to see how the Greens are campaigning in this area.”\n\nYet, plumber Hannah Spencer took the seat with 14,980 votes, with Matt Goodwin on 10,578 for Reform and Labout third with 9,364.\n\nWhen asked about accusations of secratianism during her campaign, Spencer said after her victory that they were “trying to unite people on shared common ground”.\n\nHer ground-breaking triumph has rathcheted up the pressure on Sir Keir Starmer’s faltering and beleaguered premiership.\n\n\n\nLabour MP Brian Leishman said: “Time he did the right thing for the country & the Labour Party, and go.”\n\nLurching from one calamity to another, Starmer increasingly resembles the Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail who insists “Tis but a scratch” after King Arthur hacks off his limbs in a sword fight.\n\nAfter Mandelsongate, 15 U-turns in 19 months and losing elections in Runcorn, Caerphilly and now Gorton, Starmer still refuses to recognise when he’s been beaten.\n\nMonty Python’s Arthur tells the Black Knight: “Look, you stupid b*d, you’ve got no arms left!”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nMany Labour MPs – keen to retain their seats – will be thinking the same thing of Starmer’s Prime Ministership.\n\n\n\nAnd they may come with political swords of their own after the May local elections which are likely to be another Starmer bloodbath."

Appearing on the show today Dr Punam Krishan told hosts Greg Rutherford and Louise Minchin that people should make sure to quiz them about any new medication they’re given.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd she explained this meant that if people throw away the leaflet explaining side effects and otehr useful information they’ll know what to do Dr Krishan said: “I think it’s really important to ask the questions. A lot of my patients worry, “Am I going to take up your time?”, but if we are prescribing something, just take those extra minutes and ask a few questions. And I’ve got a list here because sometimes you just worry that you don’t know what to say.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDr Krishnan’s questions to ask any GP about medicine\n\nMedicine:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat is it for?\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHow long does it take?\n\nHow can I tell it works?\n\nApplication\n\nHow often should I take?\n\nWhen should I take?\n\nFood/water?\n\nWhat if I miss a dose?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSide effects:\n\nDoes it have any?\n\nWhat do I do if I get any?\n\nShould I stop taking it?\n\nOn the issue of leaflets she said there was also help online: “We misplace them, we lose them, and if you do, you do not need to worry because the NHS website does have a dedicated medicines A to Z page where you can look up any medication, and it’s also got information about side effects.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Of course, remember your pharmacist, your GP, we are the prescribers, we know about these medications, we are there to use. So, if you have any queries or concerns about it, then ask a pharmacist or your GP about it. And if you are visually impaired, there is a regulation, the MHRA has a regulation stating that this patient information about medications should be accessible. So, on request, it is available in Braille, large print, you can get audio versions of it, you know, there’s a lot of information.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nShe added: “So ask about the medicine, you know, what is it for? How does it work? How long is it going to take to actually start working, and how will I know if it isn’t working? I think that’s really important. Ask about how you take it, you know, how often should you be taking it? Do you take it with food? Do you take it with water? What do you do if you miss a dose?\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“And lastly, ask about side effects. You don’t need—we’re not going to go through the whole list of them—but you know, does the medication have any common side effects? What to expect in those first few days? What to do if you experience any side effects, and you know, when to seek medical urgent help.”\n\nShe explained there is one thing people should never do - stop their medication if they get side effects: “The first thing to say is: ask your GP or your pharmacist. Your pharmacist is very accessible. So if you start to find “Oh, I’m feeling a bit sicky,” or whatever the side effects may be, you’ve got that information.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“If you’re on any long-term meds, I think that a lot of people can sometimes just go, ‘Well, I don’t know if it’s working for me, so I’ll just stop it.’ Never do that. Always make sure that you speak to your doctor about it because some medications can cause withdrawal effects as well. So, you know, we like to taper those down.\n\n“If it’s mild symptoms, I always say track them, you know, make a little note. Is it happening just shortly after you’ve taken the medication? Of course, if it’s a more urgent or severe reaction—severe vomiting, a rash, anaphylaxis—that needs emergency help.”\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "Problems caused by Omeprazole may be seen in your skin, doctor says\n\nA gut health specialist explained how the protective medicine turns on your gut\n\nOmeprazole users told to watch out for 'red flag'\n\nOmeprazole is prescribed to treat common conditions such as heartburn, indigestion and acid reflux, but prolonged or frequent use of the medication can trigger a variety of problems. According to one gut health specialist, some of these issues can manifest on your skin.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDr Sari Arponen, an expert in gut microbiota, cautioned that omeprazole and other widely-used medications could be responsible for certain skin complaints. Speaking on COPE Cool, the specialist outlined how our gut health can influence the condition of our skin and provide clues about what's occurring inside our bodies.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe even proposed: \"Skin treatment could involve personalised analyses of the microbiota.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGut health depends on a carefully balanced population of various bacteria types, which is essential for our digestion, immune system and metabolism. When the bacteria is properly balanced, the skin remains more hydrated and regenerates effectively because the gut transmits \"calming, anti-inflammatory signals\".\n\nView 2 Images Taking omeprazole long-term can lead to issues, the doctor said (Image: GETTY)\n\nWhen these bacteria become imbalanced, it can result in inflammation and associated skin problems. The doctor noted that rosacea, which causes facial redness and bumps, is typically associated with an excessive amount of a particular bacteria in the small intestine.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe chronic condition isn't contagious and is generally triggered by factors such as sunlight, stress, alcohol, hot weather or drinks. Atopic dermatitis, the most prevalent type of eczema, is associated with a diminished diversity of gut bacteria, according to the doctor.\n\nAcne is also connected to low-grade inflammation related to intestinal health. This delicate link between gut bacteria and skin conditions means that medications like omeprazole, which can alter the population of gut bacteria, may result in skin problems. She said: \"Omeprazole and related medications, can cause many problems by significantly altering the stomach's pH.\"\n\nView 2 Images Omeprazole is commonly used to treat heartburn, acid reflux and indigestion (Image: GETTY)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDr Arponen cautioned that omeprazole and other proton pump inhibitors often alter the pH levels in your digestive system, which can affect the balance or biodiversity of your gut bacteria.\n\nShe advised people to take the medication under medical supervision and suggested the possible use of probiotics to mitigate the adverse effects of these drugs.\n\nThe gut-skin connection can also be influenced by our diet. Substances such as sugar, additives and ultra-processed foods are known as pro-inflammatory ingredients, triggering a chain reaction in the gut and skin.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nConversely, foods rich in polyphenols, fibre and quality fats create a protective environment for both systems. This includes most foods found in the Mediterranean diet.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

He quickly dropped to the ice as teammate Dylan Cozens dropped gloves with Edvinsson.\n\nBoth players were sent to the box, as was Tkachuk, who got a 10-minute misconduct after trying to confront Edvinsson.\n\nTkachuk and Edvinsson continued chirping at each other from their respective penalty boxes as they both gestured to the replay being played on the scoreboard.\n\nDetroit ultimately won in overtime on a goal from Tkachuk's Team USA teammate, Dylan Larkin.\n\nSimon Edvinsson catches Brady Tkachuk with an interference and Brady's own stick hits him in the face in the process 🫣\n\n\n\nDylan Cozens came to the defence of his captain to drop the mitts 👊 pic.twitter.com/7ifkNJcsiD — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 27, 2026\n\nFacing the visiting Detroit Red Wings in Canada's capital on Thursday, Tkachuk was on the receiving end of a brutal blindside hit from 6ft6 Swedish defenseman Simon Edvinsson\n\nHead athletic therapist Domenic Nicoletta of the Ottawa Senators assists Brady Tkachuk\n\nSimon Edvinsson of the Detroit Red Wings fights Dylan Cozens after the hit on Tkachuk\n\nSenators spokespeople did not respond to the Daily Mail's request for an update on Tkachuk.\n\nThursday's loss came after Tkachuk criticized the White House over an AI social media video.\n\nAfter winning gold against the rival Canadians, Tkachuk and 19 other members of Team USA visited Trump at the White House before watching State of the Union speech on Tuesday night.\n\nBut since then, the White House released a misleading AI clip on TikTok in which Tkachuk appeared to criticize Canadians.\n\n'They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple-syrup-eating f***s a lesson,' Tkachuk said in the altered clip which had more than 11 million views on TikTok.\n\nTkachuk responded to the clip ahead of Thursday's game.\n\n'Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,' Tkachuk said Thursday. 'I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.'\n\nUSA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-edited video posted by the White House\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the video, he added: 'It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying.\n\n'I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.'\n\nTrump also sparked controversy after footage of his phone call with the victorious men's team surfaced on social media.\n\nWhile congratulating them on winning gold, the President joked that he was also 'going to have to bring the women's team' to Washington after they also beat Canada in the final.\n\nTrump then added that he 'probably would be impeached' if he didn't extend the invitation to America's female hockey champions.\n\nThe women's team subsequently turned down Trump's invitation due to 'scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games.'\n\nAnd Tkachuk said he understood why they could have felt insulted by his locker-room joke, which some have labeled misogynistic.\n\n'I mean, I get it,' he said before detailing the positive relationship between the men's and women's teams. 'We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n'If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.'\n\nTkachuk was also accused by some of shouting 'Close the northern border!' during the congratulatory call with Trump, but he stressed: 'It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.'\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump announced that the USA women's team will still be visiting the White House at a later date despite rejecting his first invitation.\n\n'They beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw. As did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House,' he told Congress."

            "content": "Back in May when Mikel Arteta was nursing the pain of mishandling another title race, losing out to Liverpool, and wondering if his side are forever destined to be a bridesmaid and not a bride, he would scarcely have believed the situation he and Arsenal find themselves in now.\n\nThey are top of the Premier League with 10 games to go with destiny in their hands and the UEFA Champions League draw has presented what can only be described as a golden opportunity to go ahead and land an historic league-Europe double.\n\nThis is as close to a dream scenario as Arteta could have hoped for.\n\nBy the time it came to drawing the final tie they had a 50-50 chance of ending up in the silver half of the bracket which already contained reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain, Club World Cup winners Chelsea, defending Premier League champions Liverpool, Spanish heavyweights Real Madrid, familiar foe Manchester City, as well as dangerous outside bets in Galatasaray and Atalanta.\n\nInstead they know now their route to the final is Bayer Leverkusen in the last-16, the winner of Bodo/Glimt, who are at this stage for the very first time, and Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals, before a semi-final against one of Newcastle United, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, or Tottenham. It won't be Tottenham.\n\nArsenal could be lifting the Champions League at the end of the season after their dream draw\n\nBodo/Glimt have beaten Manchester City on their own patch and knocked out last season's finalists Inter Milan over two legs. But excitement should be through the roof in London Colney this morning.\n\nThe snap reaction to the draw made for fascinating viewing across the continent.\n\nThere was a sense of devilment in France after PSG drew Chelsea, who they lost to in the Club World Cup final over the summer, with daily sports newspaper L'Equipe running the headline: 'The time for revenge'.\n\nAcross in Spain, with three teams all drawn against English opposition, the reaction was markedly mixed.\n\nFrustration in one half of Madrid as Real Madrid, for the 10th and 11th time in five seasons, take on Manchester City in a 'scalding' draw. On the other side of the City, Atletico Madrid supporters rejoiced at getting a visit from 'Dr Tottenham'.\n\nFor Barcelona, who drew Newcastle United, it was little more than a shrug of the shoulders for what they see as the 'least tough' draw.\n\nIvan Rakitic pulls out Arsenal's name on the ideal side of the draw for Mikel Arteta's men\n\nWhat this draw did do was pave a path for the Ballon d'Or contenders and in a season where Champions League and the World Cup will hold the most weight - domestic records never seem to interest voters in these cycles - the stars are aligning for the likes of Declan Rice and Harry Kane.\n\nFor Kane, he has the difficult path, needing to go through Atalanta, then either Real Madrid or Manchester City, just to book a semi-final with potentially defending champions PSG.\n\nFor Rice, this may be his greatest ever opportunity with a Premier League title, Champions League title, and a World Cup all still in his sights.\n\nFor both to meet in the final in Budapest, with all the marbles pushed to the middle of the table as they both chase their first ever Champions League title, may have seemed a somewhat remote prospect.

Videos later plastered over social media showed Wilshere appearing to say ‘shut your f***ing mouth’ before being led away down the tunnel.\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’ while another called it ‘something you would never say in the street’. At least one member of club staff took it upon themselves to call Wilshere early the next morning to check in on him.\n\nLuton Town manager Jack Wilshere had to be restrained by his own players amid a furious confrontation with a supporter\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’\n\nYou know things have gone wrong somewhere when a fan is throwing abuse at a young coach who started his playing career at Luton aged eight, grew up a few miles down the road, and returned to train with the club before hanging up his boots.\n\nSo, why such anger? Luton are unbeaten in 11 home league games and, if they win their game in hand on Huddersfield, would be three points off the play-offs. Their victory over Plymouth, having been reinstated into the competition after Swindon Town fielded two ineligible players against them, has them a home win against Northampton Town next week from Wembley.\n\nFor a start, supporters are struggling to embrace Wilshere’s style of play. The Arsene Wenger disciple wants his team to get it down and pass it, as his Arsenal Under 18s did to great effect, but this is a club that reached its heights on fast-paced blood and thunder under Rob Edwards.\n\nJust 97 seconds had passed against Burton when midfielder George Saville passed back to centre half Mads Andersen and the first boos sounded. And on Tuesday as Luton fumbled at the back under pressure from Plymouth’s front line, a furious cry of ‘Get it out! It’s tippy-tappy AGAIN!’ echoed from the back of the Main Stand.\n\nWilshere has talked about forging an identity, and a desire not to 'pass the ball around the back just to pass it around the back’, but six away defeats on the spin and unsuccessfully sitting on their narrow lead against Burton pushed them to tipping point.\n\n‘My message to them is point their anger towards me,’ said Wilshere after a loss to Wigan in the previous game. ‘I'm their manager, I make the decisions.’ So, they did.\n\nClub sources insist Saturday’s incident was a one-off. Wilshere has been happy to speak with fans after games about their frustrations, as he did after a draw at Leyton Orient, but on this occasion felt he had no choice but to react to personal abuse.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere. He’s the third manager in less than a year for a club that has suffered back-to-back relegations, the second of which came on the final day of last season when they shipped five to West Brom and went down on goal difference.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere. He’s the third manager in less than a year for a club that has suffered back-to-back relegations\n\nLuton are unbeaten in 11 home league games and, if they win their game in hand, would be three points off the play-offs\n\nLEAGUE ONE PLAY-OFF RACE Team Pl W D L GD Pts 1 Cardiff 33 21 6 6 28 69 2 Lincoln 33 20 8 5 28 68 3 Bolton 34 15 13 6 12 58 4 Bradford 33 17 7 9 6 58 5 Stockport 33 16 8 9 5 56 6 Huddersfield 34 15 7 12 10 52 7 Reading 33 12 12 9 5 48 8 Stevenage 32 13 9 10 1 48 9 Wycombe 33 12 11 10 10 47 10 LUTON 33 13 7 13 2 46\n\n‘In many ways, Jack is just caught in the crossfire of it all,’ Kevin Harper of the Luton Supporters' Trust tells Daily Mail Sport.\n\n‘Some of his decision-making has been questionable and some of the football we’ve played has been hard to watch. But Jack isn’t the root of the problem.\n\n‘We’ve gone from the Premier League to 10th in League One in 18 months and there is an awful lack of communication from those above as to why this happened.\n\n'We don’t get relegated twice without making errors, certainly not with the financial windfalls from the Premier League. The fans just feel like they’re being taken a little for granted.’\n\nChief executive Gary Sweet insisted in September after a poor start under Matt Bloomfield that reaching the play-offs was the ‘absolute minimum’ and automatic promotion still the target... yet hired a young, inexperienced coach a month later in Wilshere.\n\nThey considered Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens, a more experienced manager, but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews.\n\nSo, while Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath. And when you’re at a club that has gone from non-League to the very top and back down again so quickly, it can be hard to readjust your expectations when faced with the reality.\n\nClub insiders talk of a much-needed culture change. One source described Luton as an ‘oil tanker’ that needs turning around. There’s been a huge overhaul of players, so much so that five of the 12 players on the club’s 2026 calendar are now out on loan, but too many of the arrivals failed to hit the ground running.\n\nLuton considered more experienced managers but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews\n\nWhile Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath\n\nAnother source remarked that the squad was previously full of players who thought they were ‘too good for the Championship after a half-decent Premier League season’.\n\nLuton are set to move into a new 25,000 stadium at Power Court for the 2028-29 season yet there’s feeling among the fans that the club have prioritised that much-needed development over the football (despite having the biggest budget in League One).\n\nBehind the scenes, Wilshere has made a start on turning the tanker around. Insiders say the atmosphere at the training ground has improved greatly since his arrival, with players sticking around to play pool and darts after sessions when in recent years they couldn’t wait to get out the door.\n\nWhen staff called Wilshere the morning after his confrontation, he was already at the training ground. He slept some nights on a bed in his office. His players’ phones ping late into the night with his WhatsApp messages. Staff have asked Wilshere, half-jokingly, if he was seeing his family enough.\n\nHe's ordered striker Elijah Adebayo, out with a long-term knee injury, to report to his office once a week as Wilshere knows only too well the importance of being kept involved when you’re on the sidelines. The night after the Plymouth game, he gave a lecture at the University of Bedfordshire.\n\nAll of this means little to fans, of course, if that work ethic still leads to performances like Burton.\n\n‘Luton see the football team very much as part of the town,’ adds Harper. ‘We’re a hard-working town and all we expect on a Saturday afternoon is that our team works really hard.

            "content": "The release of the latest season of Netflix's Drive to Survive has revealed the poignant moment former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner broke the news of his sacking to his Spice Girl wife Geri Halliwell.\n\nThe long-serving team boss was deposed midway through the 2025 season amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor, one year on from his sex texting scandal which set the Formula One world alight.\n\nHorner eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package, but while his departure sent shockwaves through the motorsport community, behind-the-scenes insight has revealed that Halliwell had an ominous inkling that her husband's Red Bull days were numbered.\n\nFootage in the docu-series' Red Bull-centric episode showed Horner opening up to his wife at the table in their kitchen's conservatory, with the 52-year-old starting the conversation with a downbeat 'hey darling'.\n\n'All... all done and dusted,' Horner confirmed as he kissed Halliwell on the forehead, before sitting down at the table and accepting a waiting latte.\n\nHalliwell looked visibly emotional as Horner gave her the scant details of his meeting, before asking: 'How do you feel?'\n\nChristian Horner was consoled by his wife Geri Halliwell after his shock Red Bull sacking\n\nThe former Spice Girl looked visibly emotional as her husband recounted how the team swung the axe after 20 years\n\n'How do I feel?' Horner wondered aloud. 'Um... I never imagined to be in this position.\n\n'Of course your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s*** sandwich like that is, like, f*** them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\n\n'But you thought it was going to happen. We came back from that Austria race and I remember you sat on the bed one night and went \"Something really bad's gonna happen\".'\n\nHalliwell confirmed that she had said that they were going to 'fire' her husband.\n\nScenes from the episode later showed Halliwell and Horner watching a race on television - a hitherto unusual way of experiencing raceday for the former team principal, who had held his role since 2005.\n\n'You haven't got any of the data here really!' Horner complained. 'Well, normally I would have a whole bunch of noise in my ears. So it's like you're blind.'\n\nHalliwell admitted that she now felt 'a bit sad watching this' as her eyes filled with tears.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekend alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at the start and end of the season as well as at proximate races such as the British Grand Prix.\n\nLater in the episode the couple took the unusual decision to watch a race from their home\n\nThe moment was captured at Horner's luxurious mansion in Oxfordshire by Netflix's cameras\n\nHalliwell and Horner were frequent fixtures in the paddock throughout their relationship\n\nWhen in February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner, Halliwell flew to Bahrain to take her husband's side.\n\nHorner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nBack at their Cotswolds home, Halliwell tried to lift the mood by suggesting that Horner might be trying to 'eat his feelings'.\n\nIn improved spirits, the pair later horsed around by their swimming pool, with Horner pretending to be on the brink of throwing Halliwell in, before she admonished him, saying: 'You're such a t**t.'\n\nThe episode also saw Horner explain who he believes is responsible for his sacking, after speculation at the time suggested that star driver Max Verstappen and his father Jos may have played their roles.\n\n'His father has never been my biggest fan,' Horner admitted when asked if it had been the Verstappens who wielded the axe. 'He's been outspoken about me.\n\n'But I don't believe the Verstappens were responsible in any way. I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut (Marko) advising from the sideline.\n\n'Ultimately things changed within the business, the group, the founder died and after Dietrich [Mateschitz's] death I was probably deemed to have too much control.'\n\nIn the months since his sacking, Horner has eyed a return to the sport, sharing last week that he felt he had 'unfinished business in the sport' amid swirling links to rival constructors including Aston Martin.\n\n'But I am not going to come back for just anything,' Horner clarified at the European Motorshow in Dublin. 'I am only going to come back for something that can win.\n\n\n\n'I don't want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built.'"

            "content": "Tom Brady mocked for 'embarrassing' fawning over Gianni Infantino as sycophantic sports stars line up to praise FIFA president\n\nFootball legends have been mocked for their 'sycophantic' praise of FIFA president Gianni Infantino 10 years on from his election.\n\nThrough their social media channels, FIFA posted fawning tributes to the controversial figurehead from some big names, including Tom Brady.\n\nThe Birmingham City co-owner and NFL icon said: 'I think Gianni is a man of the people and he's always out there celebrating the great parts of the sport. I think he's made great contributions to the world of football.'\n\nBrady's 'man of the people' line riled up a number of supporters, particularly in light of the exorbitant ticket prices at this year's World Cup.\n\nTickets to group games in next year's tournament hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico are three times more expensive than in the previous World Cup.\n\nThe cheapest seats at the final will cost £3,129 and there has been a huge backlash from fans - with Infantino insisting the prices simply reflect 'absolutely crazy' public demand.\n\nFIFA shared a number of tributes to Gianni Infantino, including one from NFL legend, Tom Brady\n\nBrady's praise led to one fan writing: 'That you had to make this montage of sycophancy then publicly post it, says more about Mr Infantino and the world's view of him than you appear to realise.'\n\nAnother posted: 'Tom Brady will literally shill for anyone at this point. Fanatics. Saudi flag football. FIFA. Doesn't matter.\n\n'Now he's calling Gianni Infantino a \"man of the people\" while World Cup tickets cost a mortgage payment and FIFA is wrapped in controversy.'\n\nThat was a sentiment also echoed by the comment: 'His \"man of the people\" Infantino has overseen a ticket price increase so drastic that most Americans won't be able to afford attending a World Cup in their own back yard. Literally would have been cheaper to go to the Euros, flights included.'\n\nOthers labelled the praise 'embarrassing' and a few claimed the FIFA president is worse than his disgraced predecessor, Sepp Blatter.\n\nThe love-in was not just limited to Brady. Francesco Totti was included in the compilation of praise, writing: 'He's an amazing person, a hard worker, someone who always wants to do his best for football. We're talking about a genuine competitive, well-rounded person, someone who is always available, always there for everyone.'\n\nLegendary Spanish defender Carlos Puyol added: 'I think he's doing a great job. He's trying to get football to grow.'\n\nAnd German World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus said: 'You can tell that he's very, very close to football, not only in his head but above all his heart. He's emotionally involved and it's wonderful, of course, that the president of a world association carries this sport in his heart like that.'\n\nInfantino, pictured this week during a trip to Colombia in a personalised hat, has been at the helm for a decade and FIFA's X account posted praise of their leader\n\nInfantino rarely misses an opportunity for self-promotion and the praise of his leadership was posted out to FIFA's 14.9 million followers on X.\n\nIt wasn't just former players gushing over the FIFA president. PSG head honcho Nasser Al-Khelaïfi wrote: 'Our FIFA Club World Cup, that's a huge success for me. Around $2billion in revenue in less than one year, so it was a big success for the clubs and for FIFA.'\n\nInfantino has been a divisive character during his decade in charge. He has been repeatedly criticised for his cozy relationship with US president Donald Trump, especially during the Club World Cup and World Cup draw, during which he awarded him a peace prize.\n\nThis week, Infantino batted down questions around Mexico's ability to co-host the World Cup this summer with cartel violence ripping through the country.\n\nChaos has engulfed Mexico in recent days after the army killed one of the world's most notorious drug lords, Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera Cervantes.\n\nThat sparked a wave of retaliation across the country and forced the country's football federation to postpone a number of games over recent days.\n\nMexico is slated to host 13 games across three cities - Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey - including the curtain raiser in Mexico City on June 11.\n\nFrancesco Totti was another 'FIFA legend' to share a tribute, calling him an 'amazing person'\n\nBut amid fears for fans' safety, Infantino insisted this week that FIFA is 'convinced everything will turn out for the best.'\n\n'I want to say from the outset that we have complete confidence in Mexico, in president [Claudia] Sheinbaum, in the authorities, and we are convinced that everything will turn out for the best.\n\n'From my side and from FIFA's side, I have absolute confidence in Sheinbaum.\n\n\n\n'We are in regular contact with the authorities, and we are, in any case, monitoring the situation. The World Cup is going to be an incredible celebration.'"

'To Tottenham, just like at one time I was linked to Espanyol, or to other clubs.\n\n'In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren't going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, \"Well, with Mauricio we played good football,\" or whatever it may be.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has not entirely stamped out speculation that he could one day return to Tottenham as head coach\n\n'But no. We're focused on the World Cup, on the United States. My contract runs until after the World Cup, so after that we'll see what might happen.\n\n'Open to everything, right?'\n\nPochettino was invariably one of the names that sprung to mind following Frank's departure at the start of the month, despite his ongoing preparations with the US national team.\n\nBut while an immediate appointment would have been impossible, the manager is out of contract after the tournament, and believed to be interested in a return to club football in the future.\n\nPochettino also remains based in England, which could further factor into his decision when he plots his next move.\n\nHe has made no secret of his ongoing connection to Tottenham too, where he oversaw a run to the Champions League final in 2018, and a second-place finish in the Premier League one season earlier.\n\nBut Daily Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that as of yet, no formal nor informal contact has taken place between the two parties about a summer appointment.\n\n\n\nSince leaving the club nearly seven years ago, Pochettino has managed Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, before joining up with the US team in September 2024."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nWe're still a few days away from NFL free agency, but teams are already thinking about which new players they want to add to their rosters. The franchise tag deadline comes on March 3, and free agency begins on March 11, although the negotiation window opens two days earlier. Not every team will make a lot of moves, but every roster usually picks up at least one important veteran. Who represents the best match for each of the 32 teams?\n\nBelow, I've suggested one free agent signing for each team. I set myself a couple of rules for this exercise: only one free agent for each team, and only one team for each free agent. I also didn't assign any player to return to his current team, even on the franchise tag. For example, I didn't include wide receiver George Pickens (expected to be franchise-tagged by the Cowboys) or quarterback Daniel Jones (expected to be re-signed by the Colts).\n\nAt the end, I've also included a list of additional free agents, as certainly some of these teams will sign multiple big-name free agents. Let's get started with the Bills.\n\nJump to:\n\nARI | ATL | BAL | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN\n\nCLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND\n\nJAX | KC | LAC | LAR | LV | MIA | MIN\n\nNE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF\n\nSEA | TB | TEN | WSH\n\nTop remaining free agents\n\nAFC EAST\n\nWR Mike Evans (TB)\n\nBuffalo needs a No. 1 option for quarterback Josh Allen, and Evans is still a talented \"X\" receiver. He has the size -- standing at 6-foot-5, 231 pounds -- and ball skills to win contested catches. Allen could also trust Evans on third down; in 2024, he had a team-high 220 yards on third down for the Bucs.\n\nThere are doubts about Evans, however, since he will be turning 33 in August and missed 10 games in 2025 due to a broken collarbone and a hamstring injury. But he is only one year removed from a 1,000-yard season with 11 touchdowns.\n\nTE Isaiah Likely (BAL)\n\nThe Dolphins' top three tight ends from last season are all free agents (Greg Dulcich, Darren Waller and Julian Hill), and they could use an upgrade at the position anyway. Waller had six touchdowns in his return from retirement, but he played only nine games due to hip and pectoral injuries.\n\nEnter Likely, who is ready to start as a No. 1 tight end after spending a few years as TE2 behind Mark Andrews in Baltimore. Last season was a bit of an off year for Likely, who had only one touchdown and dropped to 19th among tight ends in the ESPN receiver scores. But he ranked sixth in 2023 and third in 2024, with 400 yards in each of those seasons. He should be able to shine in a Miami offense that doesn't need to feed a lot of other receivers after it released Tyreek Hill and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine.\n\nEdge Jaelan Phillips (PHI)\n\nThe Patriots' two biggest needs this offseason are edge rusher and offensive line. On the O-line, they will likely depend on the development of young players like Will Campbell and Jared Wilson. But the edge is a good place to bring in a veteran.\n\nPhillips had two sacks and 27 pressures after he was traded to the Eagles from Miami at midseason. His 12.4% pass rush win rate ranked 24th among qualifying edge rushers. Phillips could replace free agent K'Lavon Chaisson and/or make a good partner for Harold Landry III.\n\nQB Malik Willis (GB)\n\nYes, it was a small sample size with just one start and four total games played, but Willis had a phenomenal 93.1 QBR for the Packers in 2025. And he had an impressive 77.3 QBR in two starts the season before.\n\nWillis is going to sign somewhere to start, and the Jets need a new quarterback. Justin Fields didn't work out, and Fernando Mendoza seems to be the only QB prospect worthy of the first-round pick in April. It's unlikely Mendoza falls past Las Vegas at No. 1 overall.\n\nplay 1:21 The teams Ben Solak expects to be in on Malik Willis Ben Solak joins Rich Eisen to break down the interest he expects for free agent quarterback Malik Willis.\n\nAFC NORTH\n\nC Connor McGovern (BUF)\n\nThe Ravens are going to need a replacement at center if Tyler Linderbaum leaves town. Why not the underrated 28-year-old McGovern, who quietly had one of the top seasons for a center in 2025? His 97.2% pass block win rate last season matched Linderbaum for second place behind Kansas City's Creed Humphrey. And McGovern's 72.6% run block win rate ranked third among all centers.\n\nEdge Odafe Oweh (LAC)\n\nWith Trey Hendrickson probably on his way out of Cincinnati, the Bengals need an edge rusher. And with the seventh-most cap space this offseason (per Roster Management System), they're in position to rain money down on a player still in his prime.\n\nOweh finally broke out after the Ravens traded him to the Chargers last season, with 7.5 sacks in the final 12 games and two forced fumbles in Los Angeles' playoff loss to the Patriots. The only question with the 27-year-old is whether he'll be comfortable playing with his hand in the dirt in Cincinnati after a few years as an outside linebacker in 3-4 schemes.\n\nWR Rashid Shaheed (SEA)\n\nThere's more to the return game than just having a fast return man. The blocking matters. Still, the addition of Shaheed would be a big step forward for a Browns special teams unit that I had ranked 32nd on punt return value and 28th on kick return value through my special teams DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) in 2025.\n\nShaheed would also be a strong downfield receiver for a unit that desperately needs improvement. Last season, starting for the Saints and then the reigning Super Bowl champions, he had seven games (including playoffs) with at least 50 receiving yards. No Browns receiver eclipsed Shaheed's 687 receiving yards in 2025.\n\nS Jaquan Brisker (CHI)\n\nLast season's safeties in Pittsburgh are free agents with the exception of DeShon Elliott and, if you want to consider him a safety, Jalen Ramsey. That's why the Steelers need to attack this packed safety free agent class.\n\nBrisker can play both deep or in the box, and he's a hard-hitting safety who will fit the Steelers' defensive personality. He missed 12 games in the 2024 season due to a concussion, but he had at least 90 combined tackles in each of his three healthy NFL seasons. Over his career, Brisker has recorded seven sacks, four interceptions and four forced fumbles.\n\nAFC SOUTH\n\nC Tyler Linderbaum (BAL)\n\nIncumbent Jake Andrews ranked last among qualifying centers with 92.4% pass block win rate, so this is a position where the Texans need to take a big swing. Bringing over Linderbaum, who ranked second at center with a 97.2% pass block win rate, would really help solidify the offense and keep the Texans as a Super Bowl contender in 2026.\n\nEdge Bradley Chubb (MIA)\n\nThe Colts ranked just 30th in pass rush win rate (29.1%) last season, and three of their top four pass rushers are hitting free agency. So, this is a good time to bring in a veteran. The Dolphins cut Chubb to clear money off their salary cap, but he is still just 30 years old. He had 8.5 sacks last season with 36 pressures.\n\nCB Riq Woolen (SEA)\n\nWide receiver/cornerback Travis Hunter is expected to be back at the start of 2026, but the Jaguars still need another CB starter on the outside if Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome II leave in free agency.\n\nWoolen has stirred some controversy in Seattle and was benched briefly a couple of times last season due to mistakes. But he still ranked 12th in the league in my coverage DVOA metric. He's also a larger (6-foot-4, 210 pounds), more physical corner who could cover receivers who might be too big for the slight-framed Hunter.\n\nBreaking news from Adam Schefter Download the ESPN app and enable Adam Schefter's news alerts to receive push notifications for the latest updates first.

But since Pickens is expected to be franchise-tagged by the Cowboys, let's further strengthen the Titans' pass rush with Chaisson.\n\nTennessee was ranked a surprising 15th in pass rush win rate (37.3%) last season, but Arden Key and Jihad Ward are both free agents. Chaisson blossomed over the past two seasons with the Raiders and then the Patriots. In 2025, he had 7.5 sacks, 32 pressures and an above-average pass rush win rate of 12.9%. The Titans could put him on the strong side across from Oluwafemi Oladejo.\n\nAFC WEST\n\nTE Cade Otton (TB)\n\nTight end is a clear need for the Broncos, so why not sign a bigger name such as David Njoku? Because the Broncos already have a receiving-first tight end in Evan Engram, and they need a No. 1 tight end who is also a strong run blocker. That's Otton. He's also useful as a receiver when needed, with 1,172 receiving yards and five touchdowns over the past two seasons.\n\nRB Kenneth Walker III (SEA)\n\nThe Chiefs need not just a running back, but a running back who can also serve as a receiving outlet for Patrick Mahomes. Walker had more than 1,000 rushing yards last season and added 31 catches for 282 yards -- an impressive 9.1 yards per reception average.\n\nHis ability to generate explosive plays could be a valuable part of lifting the Chiefs' offense back to the top of the league.\n\nplay 2:05 Will Kenneth Walker III still be with the Seahawks next season? The \"Get Up\" crew debates whether the Seahawks should do all they can to keep Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III.\n\nLB Quay Walker (GB)\n\nThe Raiders could use playmakers all across their defense, and both of last season's starting linebackers are free agents. Walker had 128 combined tackles with the Packers last season and has sideline-to-sideline speed to track down running backs. He can be used as a blitzer as well. The Raiders would just need to make sure their other linebacker is strong in coverage, as that's a weakness for Walker.\n\nG Isaac Seumalo (PIT)\n\nThe Chargers will get tackles Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt back next season, but they still need big help on the interior offensive line. Left guard Zion Johnson, now a free agent, was near the bottom of the league in pass block win rate (87.4%) last season. Center Bradley Bozeman also announced his retirement on Feb. 23.\n\nOn the other hand, the veteran Seumalo was second among 65 qualifying guards with a 97.3% pass rush win rate and fourth with a 76.9% run block win rate. This would be a huge step toward making the Chargers a serious Super Bowl contender.\n\nNFC EAST\n\nLB Devin Lloyd (JAX)\n\nThe Cowboys had one of the worst defenses in NFL history in 2025, according to my DVOA metric, and they are in desperate need of playmakers. So why not bring in Lloyd? He is a solid starting linebacker who had five interceptions and 1.5 sacks last season.\n\nCB Eric Stokes (LV)\n\nCornerbacks are a tough choice in free agency because they are so inconsistent from season to season. Stokes was one of the worst cornerbacks in the league in 2024, but he transformed into one of the league's best in 2025 with 53 total tackles and five passes defensed.\n\nIt's safe to say that we don't know what version of Stokes we'll see in 2026. But this is a clear position of need for the Giants, who ranked 17th in yards allowed per completion last season (10.9). They can take a chance that Stokes is closer to his 2025 play.\n\nEdge Boye Mafe (SEA)\n\nThe Eagles could use more help on the edge to rotate with Nolan Smith Jr. and Jalyx Hunt, and Mafe had an outstanding season for the Super Bowl champions in 2025.\n\nAlthough Mafe had only two sacks, he added 33 pressures. His 18.7% pass rush win rate was eighth among edge rushers and his 11.4% pressure rate was 17th. Mafe is quick and still in his prime, turning 28 in late November.\n\nEdge Trey Hendrickson (CIN)\n\nFor the No. 1 free agent, we're looking for three things. First, a team with a gaping hole at the edge rusher position. Second, a team with a lot of cap space. Third, a legitimate playoff contender.\n\nThe Commanders definitely hit that first qualifier, as three of their top four edges are free agents. They also hit the second qualifier with the sixth-most cap space, per Roster Management System. And you might not think of them as a legitimate playoff contender, but they are only one season removed from appearing in the NFC Championship Game.\n\nI think coach Dan Quinn will need to try his hardest to convince Hendrickson to come in and help improve the struggling Washington pass rush.\n\nNFC NORTH\n\nS Kam Curl (LAR)\n\nBoth Jaquan Brisker and Kevin Byard III are free agents, so even if one of them returns, the Bears will need help at the safety position. Curl can play either deep or in the box, depending on what Chicago needs and which of their veterans is re-signed in free agency.\n\nCurl recorded two interceptions and five passes defensed in 2025, and he was tied for fifth with 79 solo tackles.\n\nEdge Khalil Mack (LAC)\n\nThe Lions' top need is finding pass-rush help for Aidan Hutchinson. So why not aim for an established veteran at that position? Despite sitting out five games in 2025 because of an elbow injury, Mack still finished with 5.5 sacks and 28 pressures.\n\nDetroit isn't swimming in cap space, but it should be able to convince Mack to take a pay cut so he can chase a Super Bowl ring. Mack's former Chargers teammate Joey Bosa would also fit the bill if he doesn't return to Buffalo.\n\nLB Nakobe Dean (PHI)\n\nThe Packers are probably going to let linebacker Quay Walker leave after they declined his fifth-year option, which means they need an option to play next to Edgerrin Cooper. Dean is still only 25 years old and arguably stronger than Walker in pass coverage. Dean had four sacks, two forced fumbles and 55 total tackles last season.\n\nS Bryan Cook (KC)\n\nCook, a rangy safety, would be perfect playing deep in coordinator Brian Flores' zone schemes. Cook had a career-high 85 tackles in 2025 and is still only 27 years old. The Vikings were 30th in DVOA against deep passes (16 or more air yards), while the Chiefs were 15th. Cook would provide an immediate improvement in that area for Minnesota.\n\nNFC SOUTH\n\nDL John Franklin-Myers (DEN)\n\nThe Falcons are one of the teams that will need a 5-technique defensive end, with both David Onyemata and Kentavius Street hitting free agency. Franklin-Myers had a pass rush win rate of 10.1% last season, which ranked him eighth among interior defensive linemen. He also had 7.5 sacks and was strong against the run; his average run tackle came after a gain of just 1.6 yards.\n\nLB Kaden Elliss (ATL)\n\nThe Panthers could use another inside linebacker to play next to Trevin Wallace, and Elliss had over 100 tackles in each of the past three seasons. He also might be the best blitzing inside linebacker in the league right now, which would give defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero a very interesting option to juice up their pass rush.\n\nAs an added bonus, signing Elliss would take away from a division rival. Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich said that replacing Elliss would \"take more than one human being.\"\n\nWR Alec Pierce (IND)\n\nThe Saints ranked 31st in pass plays that gained at least 20 yards last season (5.6%). So let's give second-year quarterback Tyler Shough a great deep threat who would help their offense stretch the field.\n\nPierce had his first 1,000-yard season on only 47 catches, averaging 21.3 yards per reception. The season before, it was 22.3 yards per reception. That deep efficiency helped him rank fourth among all wide receivers in my DYAR (defense-adjusted yards above replacement) metric in 2025.\n\nplay 0:42 What is Alec Pierce's fantasy outlook for 2026? Matt Bowen breaks down the importance of Alec Pierce's free agency destination for his fantasy value next season.\n\nLB Alex Anzalone (DET)\n\nThe time might have finally come for 36-year-old Lavonte David to leave the Buccaneers, which opens a spot for a veteran in the middle of Tampa Bay's defense. Anzalone is strong against the run and had 2.5 sacks and eight passes defensed for Detroit last season.\n\nNFC WEST\n\nOT Braden Smith (IND)\n\nHere's the team with the biggest need for a right tackle, as both Jonah Williams and Kelvin Beachum were low in pass block win rate last season and are going to be free agents. Smith has been steady for the Colts, ranking 34th out of 68 qualifying players in pass block win rate last season (90.6%).\n\nCB Jaylen Watson (KC)\n\nThe Rams are going to have some changes in the secondary next season. Cornerbacks Cobie Durant and Ahkello Witherspoon are free agents, as is nickelback Roger McCreary, who barely played after he was picked up from Tennessee at midseason. Darious Williams is still on the roster but could use a change of scenery.\n\nWatson is a talented corner with the size (6-foot-2, 197 pounds) to press and the awareness to play zone coverage. He had a phenomenal coverage DVOA in six games in 2024, then was above average (40th out of 98 qualifying) in a full season in 2025.\n\nG Joel Bitonio (CLE)\n\nWould the 49ers be willing to put 34-year-old Bitonio next to 37-year-old Trent Williams (assuming the Niners and Williams can work out his contract situation) on the left side of their offensive line? There is an opening here, and a chance for Bitonio to finally go after a Super Bowl ring with a real contender.\n\nHe ranked third among all guards with a 96.4% pass block win rate last season, and his run block win rate of 72.3% was above average. Alijah Vera-Tucker would also be an interesting signing for the 49ers if they wanted to go younger at left guard instead.\n\nWR Jauan Jennings (SF)\n\nThis signing would achieve a couple of goals for the Seahawks. It would give them a receiver to replace Rashid Shaheed if he leaves in free agency. Furthermore, Jennings is a strong run blocker and the Seahawks still want to be a run-first offense.\n\nNew offensive coordinator Brian Fleury is familiar with Jennings from his time in San Francisco, and adding Jennings would bring the benefit of taking away from an important division rival. Jennings had nine touchdowns last season but was even better in 2024, when he ranked 12th in ESPN's receiver scores.\n\nTop remaining free agents not assigned to a team:"

(0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

Despite Trump's outspoken support and multiple politicians taking stances on issues such as athlete employment, the NCAA has been unable to get a bill to the floor for a vote.\n\nYahoo Sports was first to report the meeting."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

(2:09)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nNeymar broke his 2026 goal drought in spectacular fashion Thursday, leading Santos to a 2-1 victory over Vasco da Gama in the fourth round of the Brasileirão.\n\nAfter the match, the former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain star addressed his critics and the mounting pressure regarding a potential return for Brazil at the upcoming men's World Cup.\n\n\"Last week they said I was the worst player in the world. Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process.\"\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\n\"The little dance [I did] was for Vinicius Jr.,\" Neymar said.\n\n\"I told him, when he scored his first goal in Portugal, they insulted him, were racist towards him and everything else, I told him 'you score a goal and do the same celebration, if I score a goal, I'll do the same'. Vini, it's for you.\"\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes. The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough. He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Content creation can look effortless online, but behind every viral video is a story of struggle, creativity, and persistence.\n\nThe trio known as ‘Three of a Kind’ has taken Ghanaian audiences by storm on TikTok, but their journey to millions of views was anything but smooth.\n\nSpeaking on The LTS Show on JoyNews, the group shared how their journey began in Kumasi.\n\n“We are based in Kumasi. Rashad and Champagne grew up together. I joined them during work orientation, and we quickly developed a connection. Whenever the three of us are together, the energy is contagious. You cannot help but laugh and have fun,” Ishfaq recounted.\n\nThe group’s first experiments with content started on YouTube.\n\n“Rashad and I had talked about creating videos just for fun. So we started creating content on YouTube. But, it didn’t blow up the way we imagined,” Champagne revealed.\n\nThree Of A Kind\n\nThe breakthrough came when the group shifted focus to TikTok and experimented with food content.\n\n“Ishfaq brought the idea of food challenge. We saw what other people were doing and thought we could join the trend too but make ours unique. That’s how the 3-2-1 eating challenge started,” Rashad narrated.\n\nDespite the chemistry, creating content as a group was far from easy. All three have full-time jobs, which made scheduling almost impossible.\n\n“Sometimes we had to meet at midnight, or even past one in the morning,” Rashad recalled. “Everyone is tired, hungry, or not in the mood, but we had to push through to make something worth watching,” he continued.\n\nEquipment and logistics added to the struggle. Their very first tripod had a broken leg, forcing them to improvise.\n\n“Our first tripod had a broken leg. We had to balance it on a stone and hope it wouldn’t fall. Every shoot became a test of patience and creativity. It taught us that content creation is as much about problem-solving as it is about ideas,” Champagne disclosed.\n\nAfter months of experimenting and pushing through obstacles, the effort paid off.\n\n“I think on our first video, it was just a bottle flip. It did better than most of our other videos, but it didn’t really blow up until our third eating challenge which was the 3-2-1. That’s when everything changed. Under 24 hours we hit a million views on TikTok,” Ishfaq shared.\n\n“As Ishfaq said, on our third eating challenge, we reached a million views, then the numbers just kept climbing. Followers started growing, people began noticing us, and many even went to check out our YouTube channel once they realized we were there too,” Champagne added.\n\nSpeaking on their success, the team attributed much of their growth to collaboration and shared responsibility.\n\n“Being a group has made it possible for us to handle the workload and stay consistent. Rashad is great at planning, Ishfaq brings fresh ideas, and I focus on execution. When one of us is low on energy, the other two lift them up. That balance and support system has been key to keeping our content original, timely, and engaging,” Champagne explained.\n\nRashad also added that their success wasn’t just about the ideas, but how they brought them to life.\n\n“Honestly, it’s not the food challenge itself that makes our content stand out. It’s the energy, the vibe, and the authenticity we put into it. Anyone can copy a trend, but they can’t replicate the way we make it feel real and fun. That’s what keeps people watching and coming back. There is nothing wrong with copying, what matters is how uniquely you execute yours. Anyone can copy a trend, we’re not against that. Copying is allowed, but it has to be done strategically,” Rashad expanded.\n\nAs a group, comparisons and criticism are inevitable, but the trio has learned to handle them with focus and maturity.\n\n“One thing my pastor always preaches is to be intentional about everything. In any group or even individually, you’ll face ego, pride, jealousy, and selfishness. People will compare you to others, make comments, or even try to pull you down. You have to accept that as part of the journey and stay focused on your goals,” Rashad highlighted.\n\n“When criticism or comparisons come, it doesn’t overwhelm one person. We support each other, weigh feedback, and stay on course. Being a group means no one carries the burden alone, it’s teamwork, understanding, and conviction that keeps us moving forward,” Champagne further emphasized.\n\nToday, the journey that began with a broken tripod and late-night shoots has transformed into a full-fledged creative enterprise. Though TikTok itself doesn’t pay them directly, the trio now works with brands and runs sponsored content, turning their passion into a sustainable business, while still managing their 9-to-5 jobs.\n\nTheir story proves that group content creation is not only possible but can thrive with dedication, creativity, and teamwork.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Institute for Liberty and Policy Innovation (ILAPI), in collaboration with government agencies and civil society partners, has concluded a Nationwide Anti-Illicit Trade Road Walk Awareness and Education Campaign across three major regions of Ghana. The initiative aims to combat the growing menace of smuggling and illicit trade, which threatens national revenue, public safety, and economic stability.\n\nThe campaign, held between 1 and 20 December 2025, covered Tamale in the Northern Region, Kumasi in the Ashanti Region, and Accra in the Greater Accra Region. It brought together stakeholders including the Ghana Revenue Authority (Customs Division), Food and Drugs Authority (FDA), Ghana Police Service, Ghana Immigration Service, Environmental Protection Agency, health professionals, students, civil society organisations, and community volunteers.\n\nMore than 720 participants joined the exercise — over twice the initial target of 300 — demonstrating strong public and institutional support for the initiative.\n\n“Illicit trade is not a victimless crime. It weakens our economy, erodes government revenue, and exposes our youth to dangerous products,” said Mr Peter Bismark Kwofie, Chief Executive Officer of ILAPI. “This campaign was designed to take the conversation directly to the streets and markets, where the impact of illicit trade is most deeply felt.”\n\nDespite sustained efforts to strengthen border control, regulatory enforcement, and inter-agency collaboration, illicit trade continues to threaten multiple sectors of the economy, including pharmaceuticals, food items, textiles, alcohol, tobacco, and other consumer goods. Structural vulnerabilities such as porous borders, wide tax differentials, and sophisticated smuggling networks continue to undermine these regulatory gains.\n\n“When illicit trade thrives, the government loses revenue needed for development, and legitimate businesses are crowded out,” Mr Kwofie added. “Addressing this challenge requires sustained collaboration between government agencies, civil society, and the public.”\n\nThe Road Walk campaign deliberately targeted busy market areas and commercial corridors to engage traders, transport operators, market women, students, and the general public. Participants distributed educational materials, conducted community conversations, and raised awareness on the economic, social, and health consequences of illicit trade. The campaign also highlighted links to broader criminal activities, including counterfeit goods distribution, smuggled alcohol, and illegal mining.\n\nAccra recorded the highest participation, reflecting rising public awareness and concern about the impact of illicit trade on livelihoods and national development.\n\nThe campaign benefited from strong inter-agency cooperation. The Ghana Police Service ensured public safety, while regulatory agencies educated citizens on existing laws, enforcement mechanisms, and civic responsibilities.\n\n“The success of this campaign shows what is possible when institutions work together with citizens toward a common national goal. Awareness is the first line of defence against illicit markets, and this initiative has laid a solid foundation for sustained action,” Mr Kwofie noted.\n\nILAPI reaffirmed its commitment to promoting legitimate trade, youth empowerment, public health, and economic integrity, calling for continued collaboration to build on the gains of the Road Walk initiative.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "In fulfilment of its commitment to ending period poverty, Access Bank Ghana, in collaboration with the Office of the Vice President, has donated 500 boxes of sanitary pads to the New Horizon Special School.\n\nThis donation forms part of the pledge the Bank made during a courtesy call by the Group Deputy Managing Director of Access Bank PLC, Chizoma Okoli, to the Vice President of the Republic of Ghana, Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, in July 2025. The visit was organized under the Access Women’s Network (AWN) and constitutes a component of the Bank’s expanding partnerships to advance female empowerment, education, and health outcomes.\n\nSpeaking on the donation, the Managing Director of Access Bank Ghana, Ms. Pearl Nkrumah, underscored the importance of the initiative. She noted that the Bank’s long-standing focus on women’s empowerment continues to guide its social impact efforts. “Our commitment to empowering women is reflected in the initiatives we champion as a Bank. Since 2015, Access Bank has remained steadfast in advancing opportunities for women, including our drive to eliminate period poverty not only in Ghana but across Africa. We believe that when girls remain in school and preserve their dignity, communities flourish and futures are transformed.”\n\nReceiving the donation on behalf of the school, the Management of the New Horizon Special School conveyed their appreciation for the gesture and the Bank’s continued support.\n\nThe donation, comprising 500 boxes containing a total of 12,000 sanitary packs, represents the first tranche of the Bank’s broader pledge to distribute one million sanitary pads to schoolgirls across the country during the 2026 and 2027 financial years. The initiative underscores the Bank’s commitment to ensuring that no girl misses school due to inadequate access to menstrual hygiene products.\n\nThe initiative builds on Access Bank’s decade-long investment in gender-focused programmes under its flagship ‘W’ Initiative. In 2024 alone, the Bank reached over 100,000 schoolgirls across 19 districts in five regions, providing menstrual hygiene education and free sanitary pads.\n\nThrough sustained partnerships and targeted interventions across Africa, Access Bank continues to position itself as a leading corporate advocate for inclusive development, ensuring that young girls are empowered to stay in school, thrive academically, and pursue their ambitions without barriers.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

He made the remarks during the 2026 State of the Nation Address on February 27.\n\n“Leadership carries the weight of final accountability, but citizens have a duty to bring their full energy, skills, and patriotism to advance the country. That is how nations are built. That is how economies grow. No policy can substitute for civic duty,” he stated.\n\n“While the ball may stop with me, the work of nation-building goes beyond that, through the labour, enterprise, and civic spirit of millions of Ghanaians whose daily efforts give policy life,” the President added.\n\nPresident Mahama stressed that Ghana should not be defined solely by its challenges. “We are sometimes tempted to judge our nation only by our failures and difficulties. But the country is defined by the choices made in response to those difficulties,” he said.\n\nHighlighting Ghana’s history of resilience, he noted that citizens have consistently chosen steadiness over despair, cooperation over division, and purpose over cynicism. Quoting an African proverb, he said: “However long the night is, the dawn will break. The dawn is breaking for Ghana.”\n\nMahama emphasised that the current moment demands not just endurance but decisive action, asserting that the country’s renewal depends on strong institutions, a resilient economy, and a culture of responsibility passed to future generations.\n\n“The Republic belongs equally to the farmer, the trader, the teacher, the nurse, the artisan, the entrepreneur, the parliamentarian, the young citizen, and the elderly retired personnel. Each of these people has a stake in our nation, and each one has a duty,” he said.\n\nReflecting on Ghana’s past trials, he assured citizens that the country will not surrender to present challenges. “With gratitude for how far we have come and resolve for the work ahead, I say the state of our nation is resilient, the state of our nation is renewing, and our nation is firmly in the hands of its people. Our nation is on the brink of takeoff. And so, ladies and gentlemen, passengers, fasten your seat belts,” he concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Plans are underway to acquire offshore patrol vessels, armored personnel carriers, protective gear, ammunition, drones, and advanced communication systems.\n\nA progressive recruitment drive is ongoing to expand the Ghana Armed Forces by 12,000 personnel over four years. For the first time, the process has been decentralised to regional capitals, allowing recruits to report directly from their regions to training schools.\n\n“This marks a significant shift from the previous centralised Accra system and ensures a broader and more inclusive recruitment process,” Mahama said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Some MPs raised a photograph of the former Finance Minister, chanting, “We said he would run away, and it has happened,” while the Minority continued waving cocoa and singing in protest.\n\nOrder was eventually restored when the Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, intervened and called on both sides to desist, urging the House to allow parliamentary business to proceed.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Furthermore, a new technical center has been inaugurated in Winkogo, expanding facilities to the northern region of the country.\n\n\n\nA key focus of this development has been President Kurt Okraku's dedicated efforts, supported by the FIFA Talent Development Scheme, to boost participation across all levels, with a special emphasis on women's football. This concentrated push has evidently paid dividends.\n\n\n\n“Ghana has been one of the Member Associations who have made excellent use of the FIFA Forward and other FIFA Support Programmes over the years. The national technical centre, Ghanaman Soccer Center of Excellence, now has new floodlights, a 30-bed accommodation for teams and two new pitches (artificial and natural turf). Another technical centre has been inaugurated in Winkogo, in northern part of the country'' President Infantino noted.\n\n\n\n\"Ghana Football Association President Kurt Okraku has been working hard to ensure increased participation, especially among women, and with help from the FIFA Talent Development Scheme.\"\n\n\n\n\"Women’s Football has been accelerated with support from FIFA for the National Women’s League, which has played a pivotal role in the Black Queens’ qualification for the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in 2024. Another impressive result has been the successive qualification of the men’s senior national team to the FIFA World Cup, first in Qatar in 2022 and now Canada, Mexico and the United States this summer,\" he added.\n\n\n\nInfantino's remarks paint a picture of a nation leveraging international partnerships to elevate its football landscape, promising an even brighter future for Ghanaian football on both continental and global stages."

The Minister of Finance Cassiel Ato Forson explained that the adjustment was influenced by market realities.\n\n\n\n“The current situation is largely driven by the unwillingness of buyers to purchase Ghana's cocoa because it has become uncompetitive and very expensive,” he stated.\n\n\n\nThe Minority’s coordinated singing and visible protest during the address further amplified their position, drawing attention to what they describe as worsening conditions in the cocoa sector and the need for urgent policy reconsideration.\n\nSee the photos below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRA/VPO\n\n\n\nWatch NPP MPs in all-black as President Mahama delivers 2026 SONA"

According to him, government has reached a comprehensive roadmap with partners to guarantee payment for all gas consumed going forward.\n\nThe President stressed that the new framework will support reliable nationwide electricity generation while ensuring that gas procurement and consumption remain financially sustainable.\n\n\n\nHe further announced that planned increases in certain gas-related levies have been reviewed and reduced, with additional policy measures expected next month, including the development of a gas processing and management framework under the Ministry of Energy and Green Transition.\n\n\n\nIn a major financial breakthrough, President Mahama disclosed that negotiations with nine Independent Power Producers (IPPs) have yielded immediate savings of $250 million and the restructuring of approximately $1 billion in legacy debt over a 36-month payment period.\n\n\n\n“These agreements will be submitted to Parliament,” he said, adding that government is committed to transparency and legislative oversight in implementing the revised energy sector arrangements.\n\n\n\nLIVESTREAMING: President Mahama presents 2026 State of the Nation Address"

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The United States military used a laser to shoot down a Customs and Border Protection drone, members of Congress said, and the Federal Aviation Administration responded by closing more airspace near El Paso, Texas.\n\nIt is not clear why the laser was deployed, but it is the second time in two weeks that one has been fired in the area. The military is required to formally notify the FAA anytime it takes any counter-drone action inside US airspace.\n\nThe earlier laser firing did not hit a target. It was carried out by the CBP near Fort Bliss, about 80km (50 miles) to the northwest, prompting the FAA to shut down air traffic at El Paso airport and the surrounding area. This time, the closure was smaller and commercial flights were not affected.\n\nUS Representative Rick Larsen and two other top Democrats on the House Transportation and Infrastructure and Homeland Security committees said they were stunned when they were officially notified.\n\n“Our heads are exploding over the news,” the lawmakers said in a joint statement. They criticised the Trump administration for “sidestepping” a bipartisan bill to train drone operators and improve communication among the Pentagon, FAA and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence,” they said.\n\nGovernment defends use of anti-drone laser\n\nThe Pentagon, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Customs and Border Protection issued a statement saying the military used a “counter-unmanned aircraft system … to mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace”.\n\n\n\nThe statement added that the incident “took place far away from populated areas and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity. These agencies will continue to work on increased cooperation and communication to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\n“At President Trump’s direction, the Department of War, FAA, and Customs and Border Patrol are working together in an unprecedented fashion to mitigate drone threats by Mexican cartels and foreign terrorist organisations at the US-Mexico Border,” the statement said. “The bottom line is the Trump Administration is doing more to secure the border and crack down on cartels than any administration in history.”\n\nSecond Texas airspace shut down this month\n\nThe El Paso shutdown two weeks ago lasted only a few hours, but it raised alarm and led to several flight cancellations in the city of nearly 700,000 people not far from the Mexican border.\n\nIn that case, CBP deployed an anti-drone laser near Fort Bliss without coordinating with the FAA, which then decided to close El Paso airspace to ensure commercial air safety, according to sources familiar with what happened who were not authorised to discuss it.\n\nAfterwards, members of Congress said it appeared to be another example of government dysfunction, with different agencies failing to coordinate.\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy said he was planning to brief members of Congress sometime this week about what happened. He said at an unrelated news conference last Friday that it was not a mistake for the FAA to close the airspace over El Paso and that he does not think a communication issue caused the problems.\n\nLawmaker demands an investigation\n\nDemocratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, the ranking member on the Senate’s Aviation Subcommittee, said this incident demands independent investigations.\n\n“The Trump administration’s incompetence continues to cause chaos in our skies,” Duckworth said.\n\nThe investigation into last year’s midair collision near Washington, DC, between an airliner and an Army helicopter that killed 67 people highlighted how the FAA and Pentagon were not always working well together.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board said the FAA and the Army did not share safety data on the alarming number of close calls around Reagan National Airport and failed to address the risks."

            "content": "Kyiv, Ukraine – Posters advertising “The Azov school of landscape design” can be seen inside subway cars and on billboards in Kyiv.\n\nBut instead of a smiling gardener surrounded by blossoming trees and flowers, the poster depicts a bearded, smiling soldier with the Azov Corps walking away from a howitzer that spews out a shell to “design” the landscape on the Russian side.\n\nAs Ukrainian soldiers keep getting killed and wounded along the crescent-shaped, 1,250-kilometre (777-mile) long front line, Kyiv faces a dire shortage of servicemen.\n\nIndividual military units compete for potential recruits and lure them with catchy slogans, witty campaigns, text messages and social media posts that promise thorough training that reduces the risk of getting killed or jobs behind the front line.\n\nMany Ukrainian men of fighting age – 25 to 60 – who cannot refuse the draft choose to join them. Otherwise, they could be rounded up by “conscription patrols” and undergo perfunctory training to end up as storm-troopers – a role which comes with a high risk of death.\n\n“There’s zero training. They don’t care that I won’t survive the very first attack,” Tymofey, a 36-year-old office worker who was forcibly conscripted last year but broke out of two training centres, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHundreds of thousands of men dodge the draft, pay bribes to flee abroad or illegally cross into European nations amid corruption and coercion on the part of conscription officers, as documented by government officials, media and rights groups.\n\n\n\nIn the first year after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion, men of all ages volunteered in droves, standing for hours outside conscription offices and even travelling to other parts of Ukraine to find a less crowded conscription office that would enlist them.\n\n“The first wave very massive, they were motivated,” a senior serviceman told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity.\n\nBut volunteers are rare these days. The average age of conscripts has risen to above 40, and their fitness levels have dropped.\n\n“We get what is left of what is left,” he said of the new recruits in his military unit – adding that infantrymen are “hardest to recruit”.\n\n“They can and will be trained, but there’s a matter of condition. A man in his 50s with a white-collar job and several chronic diseases is not exactly fit,” he said.\n\nAzov’s hiring spree\n\nWhile recruitment campaigns are very visible, the hiring process is largely non-transparent.\n\nMost of the applications should be filled online, and only prospective candidates are invited to recruitment offices whose locations are not disclosed because Russia targets them with drones, missiles or attacks by people recruited via messaging apps or the dark web.\n\nAnd when it comes to picking the cream of the crop, Azov, now known as the First National Guard Corps, and its offshoot, The Third Storm Brigade, reign supreme.\n\nApart from the “school of landscape design,” Azov has billboards and online s offering sarcastically named “courses” in “content making,” “event management” and “cross-fit”.\n\nAzov has, for years, been one of Ukraine’s most outspoken military units, and its servicemen were dubbed “300 Spartans” for their months-long defence of the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol in early 2022 that ended only when top brass ordered them to surrender.\n\nSome 700 of Azov fighters are still behind bars in Russia, facing torture and starvation, according to swapped servicemen and Ukrainian officials.\n\nThey have become the bogeymen of the Kremlin propaganda machine that calls them “neo-Nazis” and claims they “terrorise” civilians and stage their killings to blame Russian “liberators”.\n\nAzov had far-right origins, but the current leadership claims to have cleaned up the brigade, denying any links with “extremist” groups. Al Jazeera is unable to independently verify these claims.\n\nThe publicity and halo of martyrdom have raised Azov’s domestic profile.\n\n\n\nAnd what its recruiters offer is a “soldier-centred” approach that takes into account each potential serviceman’s background, shape, medical history and military experience – or lack thereof.\n\n“We are building a system centred around a soldier, because a soldier is not a resource, it’s the basis of the whole system,” a senior Azov recruiter who identified himself by his call sign, Tara, told Al Jazeera in one of Azov’s open spaces in central Kyiv.\n\nThe open space is a far cry from average Ukrainian conscription centres usually located in gloom, claustrophobic Soviet-era buildings with drafty corridors and creaky floors.\n\nIt has a cafeteria with a menu most hipsters would find palatable, and a shop with trendy T-shirts, hoodies and souvenirs.\n\n“A nation that doesn’t stand up for its heroes kneels before the enemy,” a handwritten sign on a wall reads.\n\nTara said that aspiring Azov servicemen undergo tests and interviews – and choose a job “with the highest efficiency\n\n“We, for our part, guarantee that [the recruits] will serve in the exact position for which they have been approved.”\n\nAll of Azov’s recruiters are battle-tested servicemen, said Tara, who volunteered to join nascent Azov in 2014.\n\nWith a tidy moustache and at the towering height of six feet, five inches (1.95 metres) tall, he took part in Azov’s transformation from ragtag volunteer crews of football fans and nationalists who were instrumental in repelling the onslaught of Russia-backed separatists in southeastern Ukraine, into a primary military unit.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller, less outspoken units can barely find enough recruits to replenish their losses.\n\n“We ask around, we tell friends, we say that we can make sure they get trained properly, but it’s never enough,” Oleh, a senior officer with a military unit stationed in eastern Ukraine, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAnd some are adamant that Ukraine should introduce a system of compulsory and universal military service.\n\n“All privileges must be cancelled, all men of fighting age should undergo training and be ready for service. Otherwise, we’ll keep on losing ground,” retired Lieutenant-General Ihor Romanenko, former deputy head of Ukraine’s general staff of armed forces, told Al Jazeera."

            "content": "Pakistan has accused Afghanistan of becoming ‘a colony of India’ but India’s relations with Kabul predate the Taliban.\n\nPakistan has accused Afghanistan’s Taliban of serving as a “proxy” for India, amid escalating hostilities between Islamabad and Kabul.\n\nJust hours after Pakistan bombed locations in Kabul early on Friday, Pakistan’s Minister of Defence Khawaja Asif wrote on X that after NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan in July 2021, “it was expected that peace would prevail in Afghanistan and that the Taliban would focus on the interests of the Afghan people and regional stability”.\n\n“However, the Taliban turned Afghanistan into a colony of India,” he wrote and accused the Taliban of “exporting terrorism”.\n\n“Pakistan made every effort, both directly and through friendly countries, to keep the situation stable. It carried out extensive diplomacy. However, the Taliban became a proxy of India,” he alleged as he declared an “open war” with Afghanistan.\n\nThis is not the first time that Asif has brought India into tensions with Afghanistan.\n\nLast October, he alleged: “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.”\n\nSo far, Asif has presented no evidence to back his claims and the Taliban has rejected accusations that it is being influenced by India.\n\nBut India has condemned the Pakistani military’s recent actions in Afghanistan, adding to Islamabad’s growing discernment that its nuclear rival and the Taliban are edging closer.\n\nEarlier this week, after the Pakistani military carried out air raids inside Afghanistan on Sunday, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement that New Delhi “strongly condemns Pakistan’s airstrikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan”.\n\n\n\nAfter Friday morning’s flare-up between Pakistan and Afghanistan, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal again said New Delhi “strongly” condemned Pakistan’s air strikes and also noted that they took place on a Friday during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\n“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” Jaiswal said in a statement on X.\n\nHas India’s influence in Afghanistan grown under the Taliban and what is India’s endgame with Afghanistan?\n\nHere’s what we know:\n\nHow have relations between India and the Taliban evolved?\n\nWhen the Taliban first rose to power in Afghanistan in 1996, India adopted a hostile policy towards the group and did not recognise its assumption of power. India also shunned all diplomatic relations with the Taliban.\n\nAt the time, New Delhi viewed the Taliban as a proxy for Pakistan’s intelligence agencies. Pakistan, together with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, were the only three countries to have also recognised the Taliban administration at that point.\n\nThen, in 2001, India supported the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, which toppled the Taliban administration. India then reopened its embassy in Kabul and embraced the new government led by Hamid Karzai. The Taliban, in response, attacked Indian embassies and consulates in Afghanistan. In 2008, at least 58 people were killed when the Taliban bombed India’s embassy in Kabul.\n\nIn 2021, after the Taliban returned to power, India closed its embassy in Afghanistan once again and also did not officially recognise the Taliban as the government of the country.\n\nBut a year later, as relations between Pakistan and the Taliban deteriorated over armed groups which Pakistan accuses Afghanistan of harbouring, India began engaging with the Taliban.\n\nIn 2022, India sent a team of “technical experts” to run its mission in Kabul and officially reopened its embassy in the Afghan capital last October. New Delhi also allowed the Taliban to operate Afghanistan consulates in the Indian cities of Mumbai and Hyderabad.\n\nOver the past two years, officials from New Delhi and Afghanistan have also held meetings abroad, in Kabul and in New Delhi.\n\nIn January last year, the Taliban administration’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi met India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThen, in October 2025, he visited New Delhi and met Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.\n\nAfter this meeting, Muttaqi told journalists that Kabul “has always sought good relations with India” and, in a joint statement, Afghanistan and India pledged to have “close communication and continue regular engagement”.\n\nBesides beefing up diplomatic ties, India has also offered humanitarian support to Afghanistan under the Taliban’s rule.\n\n\n\nAfter a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck northern Afghanistan in November last year, India shipped food, medicine and vaccines, and Jaishankar was also among the first foreign ministers to call Muttaqi and offer his support. Since last December, India has also approved and implemented several healthcare infrastructure projects in Afghanistan, according to a December 2025 report by the country’s press information bureau.\n\nPraveen Donthi, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that the costs of avoiding engagement with the Taliban in the past have compelled the Indian government to adopt strategic pragmatism towards the Afghan leadership this time.\n\n“New Delhi does not want to disregard this relationship on ideological grounds or create strategic space for India’s main strategic rivals, Pakistan and China, in its neighbourhood,” he said.\n\nRaghav Sharma, professor and director at the Centre for Afghanistan Studies at the OP Jindal Global University in India, added that the current engagement also stems from New Delhi’s pragmatic realisation that the Taliban is now in charge in Afghanistan and that there is no meaningful opposition.\n\n“States engage in order to protect and further their interests. While there is little by way of ideological convergence, there are areas of strategic convergence, which is what has pushed India to engage with the Taliban, some of their unpalatable policies notwithstanding,” he said.\n\nIs this a new stance towards Afghanistan?\n\nNo. India’s growing influence and engagement with Afghanistan began well before the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.\n\nBetween December 2001 and September 2014, during the US presence in Afghanistan, New Delhi was a strong supporter of the Karzai government, and then of his successor, Ashraf Ghani’s government, which was in power from September 2014 until August 2021, when the US withdrew from the country.\n\nIn October 2011, under Karzai, India and Afghanistan renewed ties by signing an agreement to form a strategic partnership. New Delhi also pledged to support Afghanistan in the face of foreign troops in the nation as a part of this agreement.\n\nUnder both Karzai and his successor, Ghani, India invested more than $3bn in humanitarian aid and reconstruction work in Afghanistan. This included reconstruction projects like schools and hospitals, and also a new National Assembly building in Kabul, which was inaugurated in December 2015 when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Afghanistan for the first time.\n\nIndia’s Border Road Organisation (BRO) also assisted Afghanistan in the development of infrastructure projects like the 218km Zaranj-Delaram highway in 2009 under Karzai’s government.\n\nUnder Ghani, New Delhi undertook building the Salma Dam project to help with irrigating Afghanistan. In June 2016, when Modi visited Afghanistan once again, he inaugurated this $290m dam project. In May 2016, Iran, India and Afghanistan also signed a trilateral trade and transit agreement on the Chabahar port.\n\nDuring this period – 2001-2021 – Pakistan’s unease with New Delhi and Kabul’s new partnership grew.\n\n\n\nIn October 2011, after signing a strategic agreement with India, Karzai had assured Islamabad that while “India is a great friend, Pakistan is a twin brother”.\n\nBut Karzai was critical of Pakistan’s support for the Taliban. In his last speech as president of Afghanistan in Kabul in September 2014, he stated that he believed most of the Taliban leadership lived in Pakistan.\n\nIn a 2011 report by a Washington, DC-based think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Amer Latif, former director for South Asian affairs in the US Ofﬁce of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, noted that Karzai was walking a “fine line between criticising Pakistan’s activities while also referring to Pakistan as Afghanistan’s ‘twin brother’.”\n\n“It is in this context that Karzai appears to be looking to solidify long-term partnerships with countries that will aid his stabilisation efforts,” he said, referring to Karzai’s visit to India and his efforts to improve relations with the subcontinent.\n\nWhen Ghani rose to power in September 2014, he tried to reset ties with Pakistan and also visited the country in November that year. But his efforts did not result in improved ties due to border disputes with Pakistan continuing until his administration was overthrown by the Taliban in August 2021.\n\nSo why has India maintained ties with Afghanistan under the Taliban?\n\nInitially, when the Taliban returned to power in 2021 following the withdrawal of the US, political analysts largely expected Pakistan to lead the way in recognising the Taliban administration as the official government of Afghanistan, improving bilateral relations which had turned icy under Karzai and Ghani.\n\nBut relations turned hostile, with Pakistan repeatedly accusing the Taliban of allowing anti-Pakistan armed groups like the Pakistan Taliban (TTP) to operate from Afghan soil. The Taliban denies this.\n\nThen, the deportation of tens of thousands of Afghan refugees by Pakistan in recent years further strained ties between the two neighbours.\n\nIndia has ultimately taken a pragmatic approach to the Taliban in order to maintain the good relations it built with Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, and has somewhat leveraged poor relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan to cement these.\n\n“With Pakistan’s increasingly strained relations with Afghanistan, the logic of ‘enemy’s enemy’ is acting as a glue between Kabul and New Delhi,” International Crisis Group’s Donthi said.\n\nHe added that despite the fact that India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government opposes Islamist organisations, “the strategic necessity to counter Pakistan has led it to engage with the Taliban proactively”.\n\nIndia and Pakistan are nuclear-armed rivals which engaged in a four-day conflict in May 2025 after armed rebels killed Indian tourists in Pahalgam, a popular tourist spot in Indian-administered Kashmir, last April. New Delhi accused Pakistan of supporting rebel fighters, a charge Pakistan strongly denied.\n\nFor its part, Afghanistan took the opportunity to strongly condemn the Pahalgam attack and the Indian Ministry of External Affairs expressed “deep appreciation” to the Taliban for its “strong condemnation of the terrorist attack in Pahalgam … as well as for the sincere condolences”.\n\nIndia has also condemned Pakistani military action in Afghanistan and has provided aid to thousands of Afghan refugees displaced from Pakistan.\n\nSo what is India’s endgame in Afghanistan?\n\nSharma, the OP Jindal Global University professor, said India wants to ensure that Pakistan and China, whose influence has grown in South Asia in recent years, “do not have a free run”, as “there is a divergence of interest on Afghanistan” with both Pakistan and its ally, China.\n\n\n\n“There are security interests New Delhi is keen to further and protect for which engagement [with the Taliban] is the only option,” he added.\n\nAnil Trigunayat, a former Indian diplomat, noted that while Afghanistan and Pakistan relations have their own dynamic, currently the Taliban leadership, even if not a monolith, refuses to play to the tunes of the Pakistan military and its intelligence agency.\n\n“Hence they [Pakistan] accuse Indian complicity in Taliban actions in Pakistan,” he said.\n\nBut the Taliban, he said, “understands and appreciates India’s intent, policies and [humanitarian] contributions”, making its leaders keen to continue collaboration with New Delhi."

            "content": "Analysts warn escalation may embolden armed groups and destabilise both Afghanistan and Pakistan. What happens next?\n\nIslamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan launched air strikes on Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, as well as on Kandahar and Paktia, early on Friday. The attacks targeted Taliban military installations as Islamabad declared “open war” on the group’s government, in the most serious military confrontation between the two neighbours in years.\n\nThe strikes came hours after Afghan forces launched coordinated cross-border attacks on Pakistani military positions in six border provinces late on Thursday. Kabul claimed 55 Pakistani soldiers were killed and 19 outposts captured.\n\nPakistan acknowledged two soldiers had been killed but dismissed the other claims as propaganda. It said Pakistan had eliminated at least 133 Afghan fighters in retaliation, while destroying at least 27 Afghan outposts.\n\nDefence Minister Khawaja Asif declared Pakistan’s patience exhausted. “Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” he wrote on social media, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned there would be “no leniency” in defending Pakistan’s homeland.\n\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the strikes on Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia but claimed there had been no casualties. He announced retaliatory operations had begun from Kandahar and Helmand.\n\nThe exchanges have shattered a ceasefire brokered by Turkiye and Qatar, which was reached after 10 days of deadly border fighting in October killed more than 70 people on both sides. Subsequent negotiations in Doha and Istanbul failed to produce a formal agreement.\n\n\n\nWhat is unfolding now, analysts say, is categorically more dangerous, with no framework in place to contain it.\n\nWhy has Pakistan escalated now?\n\nPakistan’s rationale for Friday’s heavy attacks lies in a renewed wave of violence at home.\n\nOn February 6, a suicide bomber killed at least 36 people at a Shia mosque in Islamabad. This was followed, days later, by another incident in which an explosives-laden vehicle rammed a security post in Bajaur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 11 soldiers and a child.\n\nPakistani authorities said the attacker was an Afghan national and issued a demarche to the Afghan deputy head of mission in Islamabad.\n\nOn February 21, another suicide bomber struck a security convoy in Bannu, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing two soldiers.\n\nThose attacks prompted Pakistan’s first round of strikes last weekend inside Afghanistan, targeting what it said were hideouts linked to armed groups, particularly the Pakistan Taliban, known by the acronym TTP.\n\nThe TTP, formed in 2007, fought alongside the Afghan Taliban against United States-led forces in Afghanistan and hosted Afghan fighters in Pakistan. It is organisationally distinct from the Afghan Taliban but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties. Pakistan accuses Kabul of providing sanctuary to the TTP, a charge the Taliban denies.\n\nThe TTP has been waging a rebellion against the state of Pakistan for more than a decade. The group demands the imposition of hardline Islamic law, release of key members arrested by the government and a reversal of the merger of Pakistan’s tribal areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, among other demands.\n\nAnother major armed group, which Pakistan alleges benefits from sanctuary in Afghanistan, is the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), an organisation officially designated “terrorist” by several countries and international bodies. The group has been fighting its own war against the Pakistani state, seeking independence for the Balochistan province, which is a natural mineral-rich province in southwest Pakistan, and also shares a border with Afghanistan.\n\nKabul said at least 18 people were killed in Pakistani strikes last Sunday and pledged retaliation, which culminated in Thursday night’s cross-border fire.\n\nFor analysts tracking Pakistan’s escalatory ladder over the past year, Friday’s strikes were not surprising, though their scope was unprecedented.\n\nTariq Khan, a retired three-star general who has served extensively in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and led operations against the TTP, said this is only the beginning.\n\n\n\n“We have not seen the peak, and there will be more to come,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Pakistan asked the Taliban to control TTP, held several talks along with Turkiye and Qatar, but it was not going to work because the Taliban refused to take responsibility,” he said.\n\nTameem Bahiss, a Kabul-based security analyst, said the crisis revolves around a single unresolved dispute.\n\n“Tensions have been largely driven by Pakistan’s repeated accusations that Afghan authorities are allowing the TTP to operate from Afghan soil, which Kabul has denied,” he said.\n\n“As long as this core issue remains unresolved, attacks will continue. From Islamabad’s perspective, these operations are framed as counterterrorism measures. From Kabul’s perspective, they are violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Bahiss told Al Jazeera.\n\nStriking military installations in Kabul and Kandahar marks a shift from peripheral border zones to the Taliban’s administrative and ideological centres. Yet dismantling decentralised and mobile TTP networks embedded along both sides of the porous frontier remains far from guaranteed.\n\nAbdul Basit, a security researcher at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, questioned the strategic payoff.\n\n“Whatever has happened represents a dangerous escalation. While I understand the compulsion for Pakistan to retaliate, I do not understand the logic of how it will help address terrorism,” he said.\n\n“It will lead to instability, and instability is precisely what terrorist networks crave, including TTP and other armed groups which have sought sanctuary in Afghanistan, and have all grown stronger as a result,” Basit told Al Jazeera. “The message is: We will not absorb hits. This is the new normal.”\n\nThe Taliban’s asymmetric options\n\nThe Taliban has no air force, and comparing the two militaries conventionally misses the point, Khan said.\n\n“The Afghan system conducts kinetic operations through proxies, guerrilla warfare, and a war of attrition,” he said. “But if you get drawn into a war of attrition, you are on the losing side, no matter what nuclear capability or air power you possess, because you are fighting on their turf.”\n\nBahiss pointed to the most immediate lever available to Kabul: Pakistan’s thousands of fixed security posts along the long and porous border.\n\n“The Taliban have repeatedly demonstrated that in moments of escalation, their preferred response is to target Pakistani military posts along the long and porous border,” he said.\n\nBasit, though, warned of broader “unconventional options”.\n\n“They have suicide bombers and the poor man’s air force, kamikaze drones. I think they will use both these options in large numbers, and it appears that Pakistani urban centres will see violence for the foreseeable future,” he said.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed drone attacks in three Pakistani cities, blaming the Taliban government. He said “small drones in Abbotabad, Swabi and Nowshera” were brought down. “No damage to life,” he added in his message on social media platform X.\n\n\n\nAnother variable is the TTP itself. Kabul’s most potent asymmetric card may be its capacity to restrain or loosen tolerance for TTP operations inside Pakistan.\n\n“So far, there has been no publicly verified evidence that Kabul is providing extensive, overt military support to the TTP in response to Pakistani strikes,” Bahiss said.\n\nIftikhar Firdous, a security analyst and cofounder of The Khorasan Diary, a journalism platform, argued that proxy leverage lies at the heart of this confrontation.\n\n“Even a cursory sentiment analysis of Afghan social media linked to the Taliban clearly shows the alignment in agenda and, at times, a clear call for action by proxy groups. And while they don’t have an air force, the drone warfare is an indication of what the future of conflict looks like,” he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIs there an off-ramp?\n\nNeither side appears to have an obvious exit from all this.\n\nPakistan’s operation received backing from the president, prime minister and across the political spectrum, with the government pledging to respond to any attack emanating from Afghan soil.\n\nFor the Taliban, absorbing strikes on Kabul and stepping back risks projecting weakness to fighters and the public it governs.\n\nBasit said the threshold has already shifted.\n\n“This has been a step-by-step escalation; not one step has been reversed, we have only moved forward. Tensions may come down temporarily, but in my calculation, there is no going back. Summer has arrived early in the Af-Pak region, and we are bracing for a bloody summer in both countries,” he said.\n\nBahiss said the trajectory will depend on two factors: Violence inside Pakistan and external diplomatic pressure.\n\n“If attacks inside Pakistan continue and there is no meaningful diplomatic intervention, further rounds of escalation remain a real possibility. At this stage, there is little indication that either side is stepping back strategically,” he said.\n\nKhan, the former general, outlined de-escalation only on Pakistan’s terms.\n\n“One likely outcome is that the Afghan government concludes it has had enough, signals to its proxies that it is over, and eventually comes to the table. They agree to share intelligence and curtail all proxies, including TTP and others. The second option is that they do not agree and continue as they are, in which case Pakistan’s response will continue as well.”\n\nCan diplomacy still work?\n\nThe international community reacted swiftly on Friday in the wake of these tit-for-tat attacks.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged both countries to adhere to international humanitarian law and resolve differences through diplomacy.\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi invoked the holy month of Ramadan, writing on X that Tehran stood “ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue”.\n\nSaudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud held urgent discussions with his Pakistani counterpart, Ishaq Dar, who is in Riyadh on an official visit. Dar, also deputy prime minister, spoke by telephone with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.\n\nBut Bahiss said durable de-escalation requires more than just statements.\n\n“A credible de-escalation process would likely involve Pakistan sharing actionable intelligence regarding alleged TTP presence inside Afghanistan, followed by verifiable steps taken by Kabul against any confirmed elements,” he said.\n\n\n\n“The fundamental obstacle is denial and mistrust. Kabul rejects the claim that TTP operates from its territory, while Islamabad insists that it does. As long as one side frames the issue as external aggression and the other as counterterrorism necessity, bridging that gap becomes extremely difficult.”\n\nFormer military official Khan argued Pakistan’s diplomatic approach must widen beyond the Taliban to include Pashtun communities and anti-Taliban political forces.\n\n“Islamabad should be simultaneously talking to Pashtun communities and anti-Taliban political forces and empowering the locals who stand against the Taliban,” he said.\n\nFirdous, however, said any sustained de-escalation would require the same external mediators who previously facilitated talks.\n\n“This, however, will not be possible without the intervention of the same friendly actors involved in the process, all of whom have already been in touch with both countries,” he said."

            "content": "The new year is less than two months in, but already more than 560 people have gone missing in the Mediterranean Sea while trying to reach Europe, making it on course to be one of the deadliest years on record. At least 500 of those were lost crossing from Libya, Tunisia and Algeria to a Europe that continues to attempt to force them back.\n\nThe stories of those lost at sea, many of them travelling on boats that offer little protection from the waves, reveal the extent of their suffering.\n\nEarlier in February, 53 people, two of them babies, were reported to be dead or missing after their boat capsized off the coast of the Libyan town of Zuwara. Only two women, both Nigerian, were rescued.\n\nA few weeks earlier, as a freak cyclone tore across the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds, possibly up to a thousand people, desperately trying to reach Europe, were believed to have lost their lives.\n\nQualified risk\n\nThe risks of travelling to and through Libya are well known among migrants and refugees. Nevertheless, they come.\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration (IOM), between August and October 2025, at least 928,000 migrants were identified in Libya, hoping to either stay in the North African country or, in the case of many, attempt to cross to Europe and the promise of a better life.\n\nBut, as they wait for the funds to pay for their passage, or the right opportunity to travel, they find themselves prey to the militias that have controlled much of Libya since a civil war robbed the country of a stable and unified government.\n\n\n\nA report, issued by the UN Human Rights Office in February, painted a bleak picture of life for refugees and irregular migrants in Libya. In it, researchers described an environment where traffickers and armed groups could conduct widespread and systematic abuse against migrants with impunity. These “grave violations and abuses have evolved into deliberate, profit-driven practices that together form a ruthless and violent business model”.\n\nOla, a 25-year-old from Freetown in Sierra Leone, is one of the thousands to have fallen victim to Libya’s militias. Speaking from Libya’s capital Tripoli, Ola described being beaten and held prisoner by one of the militias in Zuwara, which is in western Libya.\n\nOla said that his hand had still not recovered after he was hit with an iron bar before he was detained in the summer of 2024. Ola remained in detention, enduring forced labour and regular beatings, for three months: the time it took his parents to borrow the $700 his captors demanded to free him.\n\n“Conditions were very bad,” he said of his time in detention, as he rubbed his injured hand. “There was a lot of suffering. We would have bread to eat, and sometimes we had to drink the water they gave us to wash in. It was very bad; it had salt in it.”\n\n“I did not have a [reputation for taking risks] in my country,” Ola said.\n\n“I did not associate with bad people. I never did anything illegal,” he continued. “I know this is dangerous, but it’s better than where I come from”.\n\nMubarak, a 31-year-old from Sudan, is no different. He fled fighting around his village near Nyala in Darfur in 2023, crossing into Libya overland through Chad. Like Ola, Mubarak described being held prisoner, being beaten and forced to work by one of Libya’s militias, before being released.\n\nMubarak also knows the risks of continuing to Europe and is ready to accept them. He laughed bitterly, “I know the crossing [to Europe] is dangerous. [But] It’s just the money that’s stopping me. I know in my soul that Libya is just as dangerous as Sudan, but where will I go?”\n\nNo deterrence for the desperate\n\nFor those willing to stake their lives on surviving what the IOM says is the world’s most dangerous migration route, European deterrence means little.\n\nNevertheless, the European states most exposed to departures from Tunisia and Libya, principally Italy, have adopted increasingly punitive measures. Under a new Italian bill approved earlier this month, the country can indefinitely prohibit boats from entering its waters “in cases of grave threats to public order or national security”.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the bill allows Italy to stop boats and send passengers to third-party countries it has outsourcing deals with, such as Albania, with no indication that authorities would check for protection needs, vulnerabilities, or physical or mental health concerns. The European Parliament has also signed off on changes to EU asylum rules that let member states transfer asylum seekers to “safe third countries”.\n\nHow effective all of that is at reducing migrant numbers remains to be seen. Despite an Italian government elected partly on the back of its anti-migrant platform in 2022, arrival numbers remain stubbornly high, with more than 63,000 people braving the odds in 2025, almost the identical number as those from the previous year.\n\n“Why people take these extreme risks is one of the big questions,” said Ahlam Chemlali, a migration expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, who has conducted extensive field research among irregular migrants along Tunisia’s border with Libya,\n\nChemlali described speaking to the women in the border region, who knew and, in many cases, had experienced the danger inherent to migration firsthand.\n\n“They told me they were already dead there [on the border], and they’re right. It’s a social death, where people have no future,” she said, “Everything is denied to them, so taking these risks is one way they can regain some control over their lives. They understand what they’re doing. The EU has poured millions into information campaigns, but the prospect of being stuck in limbo with no future feels worse. This is especially true for women with children. The presence of children can be a huge motivator, but of course, it also increases the risks.”\n\nIn Ola’s case, the drive to reach Europe is unwavering. He craves the rule of law – anything that would lead to consequences for those committing acts of violence against him.\n\n“Life in Europe would be amazing,” he said, the tone of his voice lightening, “I would be safe. There is no violence there. If there is violence, it is punished by the law.\n\n“I will educate myself and then get a job.”"

            "content": "Just months after Netflix struck a deal to acquire the Warner Bros. studio, HBO, HBO Max, and Warner Games, the streaming giant has backed out of the arrangement, declining to raise its offer beyond Paramount’s “best and final” bid.\n\nIt’s just the latest twist in the acquisition saga, which started with a bidding war that reportedly also involved Apple, Amazon, and Comcast. Once Netflix and Warner Bros. came to an agreement on December 5th, Paramount tried to force its way into the deal, announcing a hostile bid worth $108.4 billion in cash. Unlike Netflix’s deal, Paramount’s includes an acquisition of all of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable networks.\n\nBut after several rejections, Paramount persistently upped its bid. It eventually came back with an all-cash offer at $31 per share and promised to cover the $7 billion regulatory termination fee if its deal with WBD doesn’t close, along with the $2.87 billion termination fee it must pay Netflix for abandoning its deal. Warner Bros. Discovery determined that the deal is “superior,” leading Netflix to walk away, saying it’s “no longer financially attractive.”"

            "content": "is a senior reviewer covering TVs and audio. He has over 20 years experience in AV, and has previously been on staff at Digital Trends and Reviewed.\n\nSince I saw the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV at a pre-CES event in December, I’ve been eager to get a close look at it in my living room. At first glance, the TV impressed me enough that I named it the best TV of CES 2026.\n\nFrom the moment I completed Google TV setup and started watching the TCL X11L I was amazed. I could immediately tell it’s the brightest TV I’ve had in my home, but it was the color vibrancy that I found most impressive. The colors we’re all most familiar with — skin tones, the sky, green grass and trees — all look as close to realistic as I’ve seen on a TV. And with the color vibrancy it looks staggeringly good.\n\nIt’s a flagship TV unlike any other that TCL has made, with vibrant colors and incredible blooming control. It competes with flagships from all the major TV manufacturers — including the Sony Bravia 9, LG G5, and Samsung S95F — and it gets brighter than any of them. But it’s also expensive, with the 75-inch model I tested going for $7,000, and the 85- and 98-inch versions for $8,000 and $10,000, respectively. And with a bunch of RGB LED TVs on the way this year, for likely comparable prices, you might want to wait before committing to the X11L.\n\nWhile the TV industry leans into RGB LED — and TCL is too, on other TVs — TCL’s flagship instead uses an evolution of mini-LED technology. The X11L uses blue LEDs for its backlight with super quantum dots (hence the SQD) and an upgraded color filter that together provide the widest gamut coverage we’ve ever seen from a mini-LED TV. Both technologies should have similar light output and color performance, although the individual red, green, and blue LED backlights of RGB LEDs could deliver more accurate colors — or they could have visible color crosstalk issues. We won’t know until RGB LED TVs are more readily available. What we do know is that mini-LED is a proven technology, and that TCL has made significant improvements to its performance with the X11L.\n\nIt also has a higher-end design than previous TCL TVs, with a solid metal frame and uniform thickness across the chassis that’s just about an inch deep. It uses a B&O audio system, including front-firing speakers along the bottom of the TV that deliver clear dialogue and, with the built-in subwoofers, surprisingly deep and booming bass. (The system can also be expanded with TCL’s Z100 FlexConnect speakers, which I’ll be testing soon.)\n\nTCL X11L specs Display type: Mini LED with super quantum dots Backlight: Blue LEDs HDR formats: Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, HLG OS: Google TV HDMI inputs: 4 x HDMI 2.1 (one with eARC/ARC) Audio support: Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual X Gaming features: 4K/144Hz, VRR (up to 288Hz), ALLM, FreeSync Premium Pro Sizes available (inches): 75, 85, 98\n\nFilmmaker mode is, as usual, the most accurate according to my testing. Grayscale performance is the best I’ve seen from TCL, with the only perceptible issue being that it crushes black a bit. With default settings, the TCL tracks a little under the EOTF curve (meaning as the gray approaches white, it isn’t quite as bright as it should be). When I increased the brightness from the default 50 to 70, it tracked the EOTF almost perfectly and still tracked grayscale very well, apart from the small near black issue, which was still a little too dim. It’s not quite as accurate as the LG G5 OLED, but it’s comparable to the Sony Bravia 9. And even in Filmmaker, the TCL can get significantly brighter than either.\n\nDefault Filmmaker mode isn’t the brightest of the modes available, with a 10 percent window peaking at 2,789 nits, but the X11L can easily get brighter. With my Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter (which is more reliable over 6,000 nits than either my colorimeter and spectrophotometer) I measured just over 8,800 nits from a 5 percent window in Filmmaker with brightness at 100, local contrast at high, and peak brightness set to boost. By comparison, the mini-LED TCL QM9K hit 5,844 nits, and the brightest OLED of last year, the LG G5, topped out at 2,340 nits, both also in Filmmaker mode.\n\nWhile it’s great that the TV can hit that, especially in its most accurate color mode, for the vast majority of people and their living rooms it isn’t necessary. For most of my viewing I set the brightness at 70, local contrast at medium, and peak brightness at high. If I had the light off, I sometimes turned the brightness down further because the extra brightness wasn’t necessary for the situation.\n\nChanging the brightness is quicker than on any other TV because TCL added brightness buttons (and a picture mode button) to the side of the remote. It’s something probably most appreciated by reviewers and display nerds like myself, but I can’t overstate my joy when I first saw the buttons. Otherwise it’s just like last year’s TCL TV remote, including an input select button, a mic for voice commands, and a settings button, and it’s backlit.\n\nThe backlit remote is similar to last year’s, with useful buttons including input select, and… …new brightness and picture mode select buttons on the side of the remote are the best addition since remote backlighting.\n\nI know a lot of TV reviewers, and some of them told me Movie mode is more accurate than Filmmaker on their samples, so I went back and did some more testing. And while Movie mode is brighter at its default settings, it wasn’t as accurate in my testing. But while comparing the two modes, I did notice that as the day went on, the red channel of the grayscale became slightly less accurate.\n\nI re-ran my normal barrage of tests first thing in the morning, and they were close to the very accurate measurements when I first set up the TV. I then left the TV on the Olympics for four hours before re-measuring with the same tests, and sure enough, the red channel measurements in the grayscale test were lower than they were in the morning. Now, while the change shows up in testing, the difference is minor and happens over the course of hours. It’s not something I noticed during my time watching the TV. Still, if you’re considering a $7,000 TV, this feels like something you might want to know about.\n\nHow I test TVs I set up each TV in my living room on my home theater credenza. I stream movies and shows through the TV’s apps, play discs on a Magnetar UDP900 MkII 4K Blu-Ray player (including the Spears & Munsil Ultra HD Benchmark disc) and movies from a Kaleidescape Strato V player, and play games on my Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. This is done at different times of the day and under different lighting conditions, with curtains open, with lamps and overhead lights on, or with blackout curtains up to keep the room dark. While I am a certified ISF Level 3 calibrator, I do not calibrate the TVs before measurement, as the overwhelming majority of TV owners don’t bother. So it’s important to know how well the TVs perform out of the box, with minor tweaks in the menu anyone can do. For measurement, I use Portrait Displays’ Calman color calibration software, a Murideo 8K Seven pattern generator, an X-rite i1 Pro 3 spectrophotometer, Portrait Displays’ C6 HDR5000 colorimeter, a Konica Minolta LS-100 luminance meter, and Leo Bodnar 4K lag tester.\n\nOn the contrary, everything I watched on the X11L during my time with it was spectacular. The fire and explosions during the desert chase in Mad Max: Fury Road look dazzling. The lush green trees of Rivendell are inviting and realistic. And the blooming control is by far the best I’ve seen from a mini LED, even better than last year’s TCL flagship, the QM9K. There’s a sharp separation between bright elements that are right next to black. It’s still not at the level that OLED can achieve with its pixel-level control, but its performance is closer than it’s ever been.\n\nThe X11L arrived at my home the Friday before the Super Bowl, and I used it to watch a bunch of events during the Winter Olympics. Through all of it, the TV has handled the fast motion extremely well. Sports picture mode adds motion compensation and some clarity settings — noise reduction, super resolution, and sharpness — but is far too blue for my tastes. Instead, I left it in Filmmaker mode and turned on some of those settings while watching sports, which is easy to do in the Picture Settings menu. Motion compensation at low was enough to make a football pass or triple lutz smooth without looking artificial, although bumping it up to medium was too much. The noise reduction and super resolution settings improved 1080p broadcast TV signals by upscaling the image and cleaning up unwanted artifacts. I wouldn’t put the processing at the same level as Sony, but it’s definitely better than I’ve seen from TCL before.\n\nGoogle OS on the X11L also runs smoothly. The apps I used regularly — HBO Max, Prime Video, Peacock, and Netflix — all booted up quickly, and navigation was snappy. The X11L is also an excellent gaming TV, handling motion well and supporting high frame rates from consoles and PC. I spent time on the road in Forza Horizon 5 and F1 24 on both my Xbox Series X and my PC and never experienced screen tearing or smearing. I also never had any issue with input lag.\n\nWith the highest peak brightness I’ve ever measured, the X11L certainly does light the lights. The X11L uses Google TV as its operating system, which runs quickly and smoothly. The X11L has front-facing B&O speakers behind a grille that runs the length of the TV. Colors on the TCL are absolutely stunning, and images look incredibly realistic.\n\nWith every TV manufacturer hyping RGB LED TVs this year — and TCL itself releasing an RGB LED TV this year — it may seem like a gamble to stick with mini LED for its flagship, even if it does push the technology forward. We won’t know for sure until the bevy of RGB LED TVs is released if the claims of their color accuracy and brightness will prove true with actual content, not just carefully curated demo screens.\n\nBut maybe the fact that TCL’s choice of mini-LED for the X11L is a hint that RGB LED isn’t quite ready to overtake mini LED — if it ever does. We also don’t know how the X11L will compare to the pricing of 2026 RGB LED TVs. Last year’s 100-inch Hisense UX is currently available for $13,000 (down from $20,000), which is still considerably higher than the $10,000 TCL is asking for the 98-inch X11L.\n\nBased on my experience with it over the past couple weeks, though, the TCL X11L SQD-Mini LED TV is poised to be the best TV of the year. At the very least, what TCL has been able to achieve by pushing mini-LED technology forward is incredibly impressive.\n\nEven though it’s an incredible TV to watch, it’s hard to recommend someone go out and buy the X11L right now, especially since we don’t yet know how it will stack up to RGB LED. Historically, TCL TV prices come down quite a bit as the year goes on. The 85-inch X11K from last year, which started at $10,000, can now be found for $3,500, so there’s a good chance we’ll see the same with the X11L. If it manages to get within $1,000 of the Bravia 9 or LG G5, the X11L is worth it.\n\nPhotography by John Higgins / The Verge"

February 27th is the date the franchise first debuted, and The Pokémon Company uses it as a chance to outline its plans in a Pokémon Presents showcase. Last year’s event included the announcement of Pokémon Champions, and the 2026 edition should be particularly big, as this year represents the franchise’s 30th anniversary.\n\nTPCi says simply that it will feature “the latest news and updates from the world of Pokémon,” without getting into any specifics.

Personally, I’m hoping for an unexpected spinoff along the lines of Pokémon Sleep.\n\nOne thing we do know is that after the show ends, both Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are getting a re-release on the Switch."

            "content": "The tranche of Jeffrey Epstein emails and files released on January 30th tie the infamous pedophile, sex trafficker, and influence peddler to elite figures across the tech industry. The world of cryptocurrency is no exception. Epstein’s connections are intriguing, disturbing — and worth mapping closely.\n\nWith his interest first piqued as early as 2011, Epstein was ahead of the game on crypto. The financier understood it as a tool for clandestine payments and shady international finance, and found prominent community members more than willing to welcome him. Bitcoin wasn’t even invented until 2009, which means all of Epstein’s crypto connections formed after his 2008 guilty plea for solicitation of a minor.\n\nBetween 2011 and 2019, Epstein invested in major crypto exchanges and software development firms. He grew close with one of the most influential yet troubling figures in the field, Tether cofounder Brock Pierce. Epstein even forged ties with Bitcoin’s core development team and mused about changing the technology of Bitcoin itself.\n\nBut while Epstein courted established crypto players, less reputable branches of his network — notably those tied to Vladimir Putin’s Russia — promoted sketchy investments and likely contributed to massive investor losses during the 2018–2019 height of speculative crypto-mania. Most stunningly, it now appears that one of Epstein’s most eager recruiters worked in crypto marketing and PR, repping both major fintech firms and fly-by-night crypto schemes… while also allegedly scouting women for him to victimize.\n\nEpstein’s interest in Bitcoin also aligned with his support for far-right politics. Bitcoin grew from the anarcho-libertarian “cypherpunk” movement, which dreamed of money free of the elite corruption that Epstein has come to represent. But most of the players Epstein supported, including the now publicly traded Coinbase, aligned instead with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel’s authoritarian and bigoted “tech right” — seemingly in part thanks to Epstein’s influence.\n\nThere’s no evidence Epstein succeeded in shaping crypto’s underlying technology, but his backing for its most extreme political tendencies has had major long-term impacts. That includes strengthening firms that have since become massive channels for funding to Donald Trump — himself, of course, extensively tied back to Epstein.\n\nBrock Pierce: “I had a Great Time With the Girls”\n\nThe most ominous and significant of Epstein’s crypto connections was also likely his first: Brock Pierce.\n\nPierce is a cofounder of Tether, a so-called “stablecoin” that uses blockchain tokens to track US dollars. Epstein met him at the Mindshift Conference held on Epstein’s private island, Little St. James in 2011. A representative for Pierce told the The Hollywood Reporter that Pierce did not know who Epstein was at the time. Mindshift was organized by a literal illusionist named Al Seckel, and emails uncovered by Protos seem to show that Epstein viewed the event as a disaster. He found Pierce one of the event’s few bright spots.\n\nBased on the emails, Pierce and Epstein grew closer over the course of 2011 and 2012, and by March of 2012 Pierce was apparently aware of Epstein’s real passion. “I had a great time with the girls,” Pierce appeared to email Epstein. Just two months later, Epstein offered to arrange a meeting between Pierce and “my new Russian” in Los Angeles. Pierce also appears to have met with Epstein and former Harvard president Larry Summers at Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse to discuss crypto at some point between 2008 and 2015.\n\nBefore meeting Epstein, Pierce had already faced allegations of involvement with the abuse of minors and possession of child sexual abuse material as a young executive at Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), an internet startup, in the early 2000s. In a 2014 letter about the incident, Pierce wrote that one accuser, Michael Egan, had used allegations against Pierce and director Bryan Singer “to extort money.” Pierce was never charged, and Egan later dropped allegations against other Hollywood figures. But Egan’s claims against Singer, who was closely associated with DEN, stood — and were later joined by other accusations.\n\nEven Epstein’s ties to Steve Bannon may have begun with crypto\n\nIncredibly, it may have been Pierce who connected Jeffrey Epstein to Steve Bannon, with whom Pierce had a business relationship dating back to 2005. While the origins of the Epstein-Bannon relationship are still murky, Pierce and Epstein appeared to discuss Bannon in December 2016 emails, in which Epstein refers to Bannon as a “pretty smart puppet master.” That’s well before what was previously understood to be the first link between Bannon and Epstein, a dinner arranged by author Michael Wolff in October of 2017.\n\nEpstein’s interest in cryptocurrency was seemingly fueled by his continuing relationship with Pierce. In May of 2013, Pierce emailed Epstein about his efforts to buy the Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox. The same year, Epstein enrolled in a general “Introduction to Cryptography” course offered online by Stanford. The course included “methods that ensure both confidentiality and integrity” in encrypted messaging and specifically covered public-key cryptography, a fundamental building block of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.\n\nAlso in May of 2013, Epstein emailed a third party about a possible new cryptocurrency in connection with Pierce, which Epstein describes as “Bit coin without the seediness.” This may have been a reference to what would become Tether. Pierce has said he had no operational role at Tether after 2015, but the firm has faced considerable criticism since then for misrepresenting the holdings backing Tether, and was fined $41 million in 2021 by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nTether has grown into the world’s largest dollar stablecoin, and much or all of the $185 billion in conventional dollar reserves backing its tokens are custodied by Cantor Fitzgerald — owned by another Epstein contact, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, until the recent transfer of control to Lutnick’s sons.\n\nPierce did not reply to requests for comment sent by The Verge.\n\nMaking Bitcoin “More Private”\n\nThe latest Epstein dump has also revealed his 2014 investment in Blockstream, a cryptocurrency development firm headed by one of the field’s pioneers, Adam Back. Back has since described the investment as coming through a fund run by Joichi Ito, in which Epstein was a limited partner.\n\nBlockstream cofounder Austin Hill can be seen in the emails tentatively arranging a visit to Epstein’s Little St. James island, appearing to write in an April 2014 message that “Fri/Saturday on the island are still possible.“ On April 19th, 2014, Epstein told another crypto developer, Amir Taaki, that he’d had “Andy Back [sic]… on my island this weekend.” Blockstream, Back and Hill have not confirmed or denied these visits took place. Blockstream did not reply to a request for comment on Back’s relationship with Epstein.\n\nBack was one of the early “cypherpunks” who laid the groundwork for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. Back’s “Hashcash” paper is cited in the original Bitcoin whitepaper, and Back is among the pioneers sometimes suspected of being Satoshi Nakamoto, the still-pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin. Blockstream and Back have played significant roles in shaping the development of Bitcoin over the past 15 years.\n\nIt has been known since 2019 that Epstein also donated at least $525,000 to the MIT Media Lab, which used some of those funds to support developers working on the Bitcoin protocol. In a 2015 email, disgraced former MIT Media Lab head Joichi Ito describes using Epstein’s gift funding to move quickly to bring several of those core developers in-house at the Media Lab. Ito refers to this as “taking control” of the developers.\n\nThe Media Lab’s funding of Bitcoin developers is particularly eyebrow-raising because of Brock Pierce’s indirect role in that takeover. The independent nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation had funded Bitcoin core developers until Pierce was elected director of the foundation in May of 2014. Members of the foundation soon began resigning because of the existing abuse allegations against Pierce, and within a year, the foundation had collapsed, laying off 90% of staff and announcing that it was “effectively bankrupt.”\n\nThis collapse, triggered by an Epstein friend, enabled the Media Lab, using Epstein’s funds, to “take control” of Bitcoin core developers.\n\nUnilaterally imposing changes on Bitcoin would have been difficult\n\nThese events have led to loose speculation that Epstein was trying to influence Bitcoin development. But Bitcoin’s 2018 “block size war,” a fierce debate over the amount of data that Bitcoin should be able to process, highlights how challenging this would have been. Bitcoin is an open-source protocol similar to email, not a single software package sold by a company, so changes can’t be unilaterally imposed by any single entity — even the “core” development team. When the “big block” side of the block size conflict ultimately lost, they simply split from Bitcoin and started their own cryptocurrencies. The threat of these “forks” makes major, unilateral changes very difficult.\n\nThe new emails show Epstein did have substantial discussions about the direction of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency development with Vincenzo Iozzo, who is believed to have been the “personal hacker” described as working for Epstein by an FBI informant. One of Epstein’s hobby horses was the creation of “Sharia compliant” digital currencies for use in the Middle East. Iozzo did not reply to a request for comment by The Verge by press time.\n\nBut Iozzo’s conversations with Epstein include inaccuracies — most significantly, the idea that Bitcoin is “anonymous.”\n\nIn fact, Bitcoin is pseudonymous: while real names aren’t attached, the network keeps a public record of all accounts and transactions, making it fairly easy for professional analysts — including those at major US government contractors like Chainalysis — to triangulate the real-world identities of active users. Amazingly, Epstein’s conversations with Iozzo circa 2014 partly revolve around the desire to “remove anonymity” from Bitcoin.\n\nThis raises the question of whether Epstein, mistakenly believing Bitcoin was protecting him, might have used the cryptocurrency in any of his activities.\n\nEpstein’s “Madam”\n\nWhile Epstein himself moved at the higher end of the crypto world, he appears to have put at least two of “his Russians” to work in the trenches: former pro-Putin activist Masha Drokova (aka Masha Bucher) and Russian Olympic snowboarder Maria Prusakova (aka Masha Prusso). Epstein’s emails appear to show both women helping place deceptive media coverage to repair Epstein’s reputation, while using the same tactics and personnel to pump sketchy cryptocurrency investments.\n\nDrokova and Prusakova were just one node in an apparently vast network producing and placing puff pieces about Epstein: one of Prusakova’s collaborators, Sarah Austin, has stated Epstein had “thousands of publicists.” Drokova reportedly joined Epstein’s reputation laundering operation in 2017, and soon incorporated the firm M&A PR Studio. Drokova and Prusakova appear to have placed dozens of articles with loosely supervised “contributor networks,” including Forbes, The Next Web, and Arianna Huffington’s Huffington Post and Thrive Global.\n\nThese networks were built to publish independent journalistic contributions with minimal editorial oversight, but they have been widely abused by fraudsters and low-rent marketers to disguise advertising as reporting. In addition to evidence of direct payments to their network of contributors, pieces placed by writers tied to Prusakova and Drokova show clear signs of promoting specific clients. In one particularly blatant case, a since-deleted writeup about Davos, bylined by Sarah Austin, included links to rental apartments that sources say were managed by Prusakova.\n\nEpstein’s emails indicate that another infamous blurb in The Next Web may have been engineered by Drokova. The piece approvingly shared Epstein’s views on Bitcoin… without mentioning his 2008 conviction. Dylan Love, author of that piece, appeared to email Epstein one month before its publication, saying that “Masha [Drokova] has made it clear that she wants me to write something about you.” In another email surfaced by Forbes, Epstein orders a $25,000 payment to Drokova and says she should “feel free to give some to Dylan.”\n\nIn 2017, Epstein forwarded himself a copy of a similar piece published at The Huffington Post and praising Epstein’s science funding while omitting mention of his crimes — and authored by a writer who also published a puff piece about Drokova herself at Thrive Global.\n\nSince Epstein’s death, Drokova has continued to build a profile in Silicon Valley as head of the firm Day One VC, including being named to Forbes “30 under 30” list in 2019.\n\nDay One’s investments include Sam Altman’s creepy eyeball-scanning cryptocurrency Worldcoin (Now simply “World”). On February 9, Drokova posted an apology to X for her two-year association with Epstein, admitting only to making a few introductions, work she claims was “unpaid.” Drokova wrote that she “was naive; I didn’t dig deep enough early on.” Drokova also claimed that Epstein “made me think I could be safe from the regime” after leaving Putin’s youth movement and moving to the US.\n\nBut many have questioned whether Drokova really turned her back on Putin — and indeed, the recent emails appear to show her asking Epstein for introductions to “adequate Russian oligarchs” to invest in her venture fund.\n\nIn addition to doing crypto PR, Prusakova was allegedly discussing helping Epstein recruit women\n\nMasha Prusakova is a much darker Epstein-crypto nexus. Prusakova competed for Russia in snowboarding in the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Olympic news site The Inquisitor found that her Olympic accreditation documents appear in the latest Epstein email release. Prusakova later studied law with Epstein’s apparent financial support, and also appears to have personally met Norwegian diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen in Paris on Epstein’s order.\n\nBy no later than 2013, Prusakova was allegedly discussing helping Epstein recruit women. In a 2013 email, Prusakova appears to write that she has “three cute and smart friends whom I can bring to your house” and that “Sometimes I think that I am your Paris based Ghislaine Maxwell.” In the same email, Prusakova discusses her prospects for admission to study law at Cornell. This is one of a few documents in which Prusakova’s name appears to have been redacted by the DOJ after the initial release, but the attribution has been preserved by archives including Jmail.\n\nEpstein appears to have later paid for some of Prusakova’s law studies at UC Berkeley from 2016–2019: In 2019 messages cited by The Inquisitor, Prusakova refers to “willingly and knowingly, indirectly, putting girls in danger” while recruiting “assistants” for Epstein as “the price to pay for Berkeley.” She continued to ask Epstein for work as a lawyer.\n\nBy 2018, though, Prusakova had also cofounded Crypto PR Lab, a firm that pitched crypto stories to myself and other reporters between 2018 and roughly 2020. These were largely sketchy crypto projects capitalizing on that era’s boom in so-called “Initial Coin Offerings.” In a text exchange from April of 2019, Prusakova appears to share a link to an article under her own byline at Thrive Global, while updating Epstein on third-party interest in acquiring Crypto PR Lab.\n\nWhether that sale was completed is unclear, but Prusakova soon transitioned to staff roles at crypto firms. For a period from 2021–2022, she was head of events at Polygon — a blue-chip project by crypto standards.\n\nDrokova did not respond to questions about her relationship with Epstein. Prusakova has scrubbed her online presence, and her most recent known employer, AethirCloud, did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nThe money at the end of the world\n\nWhatever Epstein’s agenda, he would have found directly manipulating Bitcoin’s code difficult. But funding the worldview behind it appears to have continued furthering Epstein’s geopolitical goals of mass unrest and elite impunity, even after his death.\n\nMt. Gox collapsed before Pierce and Epstein could invest in that exchange, but in 2014, Pierce facilitated a $3 million early investment by Epstein into Coinbase, now the largest crypto exchange in the United States.\n\nAs detailed by Decrypt, emails between Pierce and Epstein show that Fred Ehrsam, who cofounded the crypto exchange with CEO Brian Armstrong, sought a face-to-face meeting with Epstein before accepting the investment in 2014, when the firm was valued at $400 million. At its current value of $51 billion, Epstein’s $3 million Coinbase stake would be worth more than $380 million. Ehrsam has not commented publicly on the disclosures, and Coinbase and Ehrsam did not reply to requests for comment from The Verge by press time.\n\nCoinbase has since imposed its own strain of Epstein’s “anti-woke” agenda on its employees, hired spyware makers who helped target journalists, and become a nexus of right-wing political funding in the US. The firm implemented a corporate gag order on the discussion of politics at work in 2020. This was widely believed by employees to be intended to quash discussion of the Black Lives Matter movement and the killing of George Floyd, paralleling Epstein’s efforts to delegitimize #MeToo and other “woke” resistance to elite abuses.\n\nBitcoin is intended to thrive when states begin to fail\n\nHacking Team was named a “Corporate Enemy of the Internet” by Reporters Without Borders in 2013, and a 2015 hack of the firm showed CEO David Vincenzetti habitually ending emails with the Italian fascist slogan “boia chi molla” — “death to those who surrender.” Members of the Hacking team at the time claimed the contents of the hack were “not true,” but the Italian government soon revoked their international trade license.\n\nAfter the hiring of former Hacking Team members became public knowledge, Coinbase removed them, with CEO Brian Armstrong citing “a gap in our diligence process” for their hiring. Notably, Epstein is also linked to international spyware via Ghislaine Maxwell’s father Robert, who has been suspected of distributing compromised spyware called PROMIS.\n\nMost substantively, Coinbase spearheaded the formation of the Stand With Crypto activist front and the Fairshake political action committee. According to Follow the Crypto, Fairshake and two other closely linked cryptocurrency PACs spent a reported $131.5 million in 2024 races, with $85.1 million going to support Republicans and just $48.3 million going to Democrats.\n\nBitcoin is intended, among other features, to thrive when states — and with them, democracy — begin to fail. Its reputation as “digital gold” is rooted in right-wing ideas including Austrian economics and hard-money “goldbug” beliefs.\n\nThis dark worldview may have appealed to Epstein and his compatriots as much as any technological innovation. “Brexit, just the beginning,” he emailed Peter Thiel in 2016. “Return to tribalism,” he wrote of his predictions for the future. “Counter to globalization. Amazing new alliances … Finding things on their way to collapse was much easier than finding the next bargain.”\n\nBut Epstein wasn’t just making predictions — he was setting goals and working to foster instability he thought he could profit from. In 2018 and 2019, for instance, Epstein strategized with Steve Bannon about supporting far-right European politicians including Marine Le Pen.\n\nThis has all too much in common with the paranoid narratives of decline that suffuse Bitcoin culture — and the accompanying anti-democratic politics, fraud, and deception that seem designed to make those grim visions a reality."

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nUltrahuman is expanding its health monitoring ecosystem with the launch of a new flagship smart ring and a “biointelligence AI” platform upgrade. The Ring Pro is Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, and promises up to 15 days of battery life before needing to recharge, alongside 250 days of on-device health history storage.\n\nThose are some significant improvements compared to its predecessor, the 2023 Ring Air, which provides 4-6 days of battery life and several days of offline data storage, according to user estimates. Ultrahuman has also made other upgrades to the Ring Pro, including a redesigned heart-rate sensor that improves signal during sleep and recovery, a faster dual-core processor, and safety improvements that allow the ring to be cut off fingers more easily in an emergency.\n\nThe Ultrahuman Ring Pro will ship with a new Pro Charging case that provides an additional 45 days of battery life and stores up to one year of ring data. The case features an integrated speaker and proximity tracker that allow users to find the device via the Ultrahuman app, wireless charging, and an LED indicator that displays battery level status.\n\nThe Ring Pro Charging Case includes a light bar that indicates how much battery life it has remaining. Image: Ultrahuman\n\nThe Ring Pro comes in gold, silver, black, and titanium color options, and is available in sizes 5-14. Preorders are launching today for $479 with global availability — except in the United States, where Ultrahuman is clashing with patents from rival smart ring provider Oura. Shipments start in March.\n\nThe rollout of Jade, Ultrahuman’s new AI platform upgrade, doesn’t exclude the US, and will be available to all global Ultrahuman users. Ultrahuman says that Jade is “the world’s first real-time biointelligence AI,” capable of pulling health data insights and actioning breathwork and atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection tasks. Future updates will allow Jade to do “much more,” according to Ultrahuman, including proactively flagging health concerns before they occur, controlling smart home functions like adjusting room temperature, and even ordering food.\n\nThe Jade AI-platform upgrade will be available to all Ultrahuman users globally. Image: Ultrahuman\n\nUltrahuman says the goal is to have Jade serve as an “autonomous health agent working 24x7 to improve your life,“ but it hasn’t specified when these additional features will be available."

Use the close button or Escape to return to the comic.\n\nIf you want to get a letter out of a Burmese prison, do not give it to the guards.\n\nPerhaps this is obvious, but when they told me I could write two a month — one to my embassy and one to Juliana — I was naive enough to try.\n\n\"All night,\" I wrote to Juliana.\n\n“A fluorescent flood light illuminates the clouds of mosquitoes feasting on me, which makes it hard to sleep, and when the mosquitoes retreat, the ants crawl in — in pulsing veins along the cell wall and floor, over every inch of skin all day.”\n\nI filled every centimeter of the official letter form they gave me.\n\n“But it’s all fine. I’ve already gotten used to it by now. I just want to see you.”\n\nThree days later…\n\n“Write bigger. And don’t say there are ants here.”\n\nSo I tried again.\n\n“Ju- I love and miss you so much. I am doing well physically and feeling more or less healthy — but mentally things are obviously rough…”\n\n“No.”\n\nAnd again.\n\n“Sorry.”\n\nI first landed in Myanmar in early May 2019, just in time for World Press Freedom Day.\n\nA decade earlier the country's military leaders had begun a partial democratization process that notably included the end of pre-publication press censorship.\n\nAfter elections in 2015, in which the military government had been trounced by the now-fallen democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi, they'd began handing over chunks of government to her quasi-civilian administration.\n\nThough representative, Suu Kyi's administration proved nearly as intolerant of its critics as the military had been, even if it still maintained wide public support.\n\nWhen I arrived, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been sitting in the city's Insein Prison for two years.\n\nThe year they were arrested, in 2017, I was earning $12 an hour reporting for a rural Louisiana newspaper…\n\n...while our newly elected president channeled fury toward press pools at the back of his convention halls.\n\nAmerican journalism was facing its gravest threats, pundits were saying, and it wasn't even paying a living wage.\n\nI came to Myanmar because, if our worst fears were coming to pass, I thought its journalists might have something to teach me.\n\nIf I had come to Myanmar looking for lessons, Juliana had come hoping to simply grin and bear a consular posting that was not her first choice.\n\nWe met on the apps.\n\n“Hi Peidão*” (*person who farts a lot)\n\nOn our first date, over a shared bottle of beer, we lamented the rise of a global far right, and pined for the lost optimism of our youth.\n\nShe quoted Gramsci and Marx, and I pretended to have read them. I rushed the bill as soon as the beer finished, nervous about showing my ignorance.\n\nOn our next date, we both confessed we'd wanted to order another bottle that night.\n\nJuliana lived alone in an airy, three-bedroom apartment paid for by her country's foreign service.\n\nI lived downtown with a 6’3\" Brit who taught English three days a week and spent the other four ranking his all-time favorite black metal albums in YouTube videos.\n\nWe stayed mostly at hers.\n\nDespite the deteriorating press situation, it seemed like a time of great hope.\n\nOn May 6th, 2019, after 511 days in the country's infamous Insein Prison, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released.\n\n“I can't wait to go to my newsroom now. I am a journalist. I am going to continue.”\n\nAnd in 2020, nationwide elections were deemed fair and credible by foreign and domestic observers.\n\nIt felt like a tide was shifting, in Myanmar and the US.\n\nJuliana's lease was coming to an end, and despite the pool and the sleek appliances at her compound, the thrill of downtown still pulled at me.\n\nWe found a secret palace hidden amid the shambles of the historic Muslim quarter...\n\n...where sunsets poured bronze light through the kitchen window and the muezzin call would metronome our days.\n\nWe were giddy...\n\n...and in love.\n\n“Baby there’s room in here… just enough for two in here. Baby there’s…”\n\nBreaking News: Myanmar leader is detained amid coup. Military declares state of emergency.\"\n\nOn February 1st, we were inundated with links. The coup had been unintentionally livestreamed and went viral.\n\n“Have you seen this?” “Wait… what?”\n\n“She was just filming a workout video.” “STOP.” “And there’s THE COUP right behind her!”\n\nTogether we watched the dozens of videos — from all corners of the internet — superimposing the infamous Myanmar Coup Dancer over history.\n\nAfter the coup, at precisely 8pm each night, seemingly everyone in Yangon stepped outside and slammed together pots or pans — any blunt objects close at hand — an ancient means of warding off evil, now a sign of resistance to military rule.\n\nThe protests were joyful at first.\n\nSigns: “My ex is bad but Myanmar military is worse.” “Ah shit here we go again.”\n\nUntil…\n\n\"Weeks of relatively peaceful protests turned deadly on Feb. 20th when two unarmed protesters were killed by security forces in the city of…”\n\nThe military began raiding newsrooms.\n\nIncluding my former employer, the investigative news site Myanmar Now, among the country's most staunchly anti-militarist outlets.\n\nOur Western friends were leaving.\n\n“Can we help Lorcan give away his books?”\n\nWe considered doing the same.\n\n“We can fly to Detroit, stay with my parents for a bit, and then road trip out to California.” “I get to meet the family Peidões?”\n\nOne night in April, just after 8pm.\n\nAn eerie hush settled over our street.\n\n“Danny! Get back!”\n\nA soldier's flashlight flooded our apartment.\n\nI booked a ticket to Detroit.\n\nText to Consular Official: “Hi, my name is Danny Fenster. I'm an American journalist working for Frontier Myanmar. I'm sure I don't have anything to worry about, but I did use to work at Myanmar Now, and I'm going to be flying out of Yangon on May 24th. I just wanted to let you know in case there was any cause for concern.”\n\n“Hi Danny, thanks for letting us know. We don't have any indication that there's reason to worry, You've given them ten days' notice so you should be fine.”\n\nText to Juliana from the airport: “lol these covid outfits got a pic w the ipad will send later can’t send pics with the burner phone”\n\nTexts from Juliana: “can’t wait to see it miss you”\n\n“Ahem… Could DANIEL JACOB FENSTER please report to the…”\n\n“Daniel Jacob? We have a few questions for you, related to…\n\n…an ongoing criminal investigation.”\n\nText to Juliana: “babe not joking call the embassy.”\n\nPEN America Demands Myanmar Release US Journalist Danny Fenster “Managing editor of one of the few independent news outlets was detained while attempting to board a flight out of the country Some 4,000 other people have been detained by the authorities in recent months…”\n\nThe Washington Post Democracy Dies in Darkness Asia & Pacific “American journalist is detained by Myanmar regime while trying to leave country Fenster, 37, is the fourth foreign journalist detained in Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in February. The military government routinely publishes lists of \"wanted\" journalists, accusing them of affecting \"state stability,\" and has detained more than 70 journalists in total, according to media watchdogs.”\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists “Myanmar arrests US editor Danny Fenster at Yangon airport Myanmar authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Frontier Myanmar managing editor Danny Fenster and allow him to travel freely outside the” [text is cut off]\n\nThe Guardian “US journalist detained in Myanmar while boarding flight home Family of Danny Fenster voice concern for his welfare after he was held by authorities in Yangon international airport”\n\nThey’d taken my electronics and my books.\n\n“Noon. Quiet Hour.” <click, lock>\n\nYet somehow, they'd missed the sepia notebook I'd been keeping since January.\n\nThe hardest thing in those initial days was the boredom. I had no news of the outside world to distract me. Nothing to fix my attention on.\n\nSo l scribbled to myself.\n\n“FRIDAY, 1pm Afternoons are the worst. Right now it's 1pm and I'm locked in my cell for ‘nap time.’ Every day from noon to 1:30pm it's quiet hour. We have to go lie down in bed and be quiet, which is actually quite fine by me. I try not to sleep so l'll be more tired at night. It's hard enough to fall asleep: they make us sleep with the light on, on top of a wooden pallet with a couple of blankets for padding. And then there are the mosquitoes biting and the ants…”\n\nI noted the endless rain…\n\n“Sheets of rain pouring down outside these bars, out into the yard, the pool that was a garden yesterday — filling the stone basin and my drinking water jar”\n\n…and my insect companions,\n\n“Drifting always to the corner, its legs splayed akimbo, forming an X with its limp antennae, legs dangling, at ease, any tensions having fled, it looks like underneath, on its insect face, it must be smiling at its oblivion, although of course it may have died in a drowning suffocating panic, but now it's free.”\n\n…my small victories,\n\n“‘Tidied' after interrogations today. Dirty laundry bag, hung shirts, turned clean clothes into a sweatpant-leg pillow.”\n\n…and my mounting dread.\n\n“2 sachets of coffee left, no toothpaste. Gotta wash some clothes soon.”\n\nAnd then one day…\n\nJuliana's package was my first indication that anyone knew where I was. It had taken several days to pass inspection.\n\nI'd heard there were books too, but the prison translator had to first certify that they contained no political content.\n\nJournal entry: “Just reflecting on how brilliant my wife is. She near telepathically included just about every essential item I’d been wanting. And she included a (new?) air-tight tupperware container, to keep the bugs out. Most of this she must have intuited. I also imagine her asking coworkers etc., ‘What to pack into a prisoners parcel.’”\n\nThe days passed…\n\npunctuated by the same routines,\n\nand occasional gifts.\n\n(And then one day:)\n\nLetter from Juliana: “Yangon, June 2nd, 2021. Danny, babe. You have no idea how much I miss you. I want you to know that everything is fine. Rose and Bud are well and healthy. Bryan is being a true warrior and is doing everything he can from the States. I am also doing the best I can in here. I spent the last nights alone at our apartment, looking around. It hasn't been long that we have moved in, but I feel like we have lived here for years. I LOVE this place. I love the beams on the ceiling, the open kitchen. I absolutely love the office — I have sat there a few times to talk to your family, with the fan on my face, and I understand why you like that spot so much. There was a power cut the other day — 4 hours in the heat — I think this is one of those things about living the full Myanmar experience. I saw a gecko two nights ago in our bedroom. I am 99% sure there is a rat in the kitchen (I know I have said that before, but now the noise is more constant. I have to record it for you). I am also observing the pigeons for you. I think there are less birds on our windowsill though — they might've heard that you were travelling on holidays. I don't go to the balcony in the mornings so often anymore, but I always go there in the afternoon. I have this image of you coming back home in the beginning of the evenings, so I go there every now and then and wait. I see the men going to the mosque for the afternoon prayers, the sandals — dozens of them! — aligned by the entrance. Everything and everyone so alive. Life passing busy as usual while we wait for good news, while I wait for you. Every single thing at this apartment reminds me of you, of this chapter of our lives. I love you so much. Please promise me that you'll be strong. I'm trying my best on my side, and I'm doing alright, I promise. A tiny bit of craziness, but I think it will add to my charm. Love you, peidão! I love you more. Ju.” After the guards rejected my third attempt at official correspondence with Juliana, rumor spread of a pending deal: two members of an armed ethnic insurgency in my ward would soon be released.\n\nI abandoned my written detente with the prison censors and scribbled out a long rambling note to Juliana.\n\n“Also what's going on in int'l news? In the US? Any big stories?\n\nP.S. plz send me some pictures of you! Things: fucking cashews! P.S. — Some additional books, if you can find them! \"What Is History\" and \"Homo Deus.\" The first is at Dom's & the second is either also at Dom's or at your place. Also, \"This Thing of Darkness,\" or something like that, is a book Lorcan gave me before he left. I think it's in that suitcase he gave me. These would be good ones. Do you think the US embassy has \"Grapes of Wrath\"? Being able to listen to podcasts and my own music would make all of this infinitely more bareable too — podcasts especially. Alas, I'm pretty sure headphones & electronics are banned. [frowny face] I love you so much. See you soon. Xoxo, Danny” The insurgent spoke no English. I willed him to understand me.\n\n“Please, take this to my wife.”\n\nIt felt like casting a bottled letter into the ocean.\n\n—\n\nIt wasn't long before the guards found my notebooks. Paper and ink were declared contraband in my ward.\n\n<click, lock>\n\nIf I couldn't record the experience, what did any of it matter?\n\nI was being forced — possibly for the first time since the advent of the iPhone — to sit, for hour after unending hour, from one interminable minute to another, with nothing to occupy my mind.\n\nof all the terror and discomfort l endured in prison, it was this —\n\nboredom\n\n— that nearly broke me.\n\nThere was a TV in our ward, but programming was limited, and all of it in Burmese anyway.\n\nA Buddhist monk, one of the only English speakers there, told me they used to watch BBC and Discovery Channel. But on the morning of the coup, the TV signal was cut completely.\n\nWhen it came back on, only state broadcasts remained.\n\n“That's how we knew the military had taken back control.”\n\nOne day, I noticed a prisoner fiddling with something.\n\nThe monk explained that for just a few thousand kyat or a handful of betel nuts, guards brought prisoners USB sticks full of Chinese action movies and Bollywood musicals, or TikTok reels of people being kicked in the nuts. Some even had small MP3 players they listened to illegal music on.\n\nl began scheming immediately.\n\nWhen I'd packed for Detroit, I'd left on my desk a Zoom H1n recorder with a microSD card inside.\n\nI scavenged the prison ward for paper, and, using a contraband pen, I wrote a note to Juliana describing the recorder's exact location. I made lists of all the podcasts I wanted to hear.\n\nWhen another detainee was paroled, I forced the notes on him with another map of the city.\n\nAnd then I waited.\n\n…\n\n“Monk?”\n\n“Sit.\n\nFocus your attention on the tip of your nose….\n\n…the sensation going in and out of your nostrils.”\n\nFor fifteen minutes, the monk watched me struggle.\n\nIt felt impossible.\n\n“Do this upon waking each morning, and for five minutes at the start of each hour, at least for the first few hours of the day…\n\nThen, when this becomes easy, up these hourly intervals to ten minutes, then fifteen.”\n\nSlowly…\n\n…a tolerance for boredom pervaded my waking moments.\n\nI could watch my thoughts\n\nmove\n\nfrom one to the next.\n\nI thought about the circumstances that had brought me to Myanmar. I'd wanted to learn from journalists standing up to unimaginable repression.\n\nBut I was also questioning the point of journalism altogether. Our problems did not stem from a scarcity of reliable reporting or facts.\n\nMoving abroad was my last-ditch effort to salvage some meaning from the work, so l might stay at it.\n\nBut when I arrived, I mostly felt overwhelmed by Myanmar's politics, home to more than 20 ethnic armies and several times as many militias even before the coup, each plagued by their own internecine power struggles. I’d felt inexpert and ill-placed.\n\nWho was to be telling the story of this place?\n\nSo l'd fallen into the role of editor, helping local writers and reporters tell their own stories to the English-speaking world.\n\nBut on my worst days, I still wondered if any of it mattered.\n\nMeanwhile..\n\nPost: “@amykurzweil\n\nOn Monday 5/24, my cousin Danny Fenster was imprisoned by the military in Myanmar for the \"crime\" of being a journalist.

Danny remains in prison..”\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Ethan Kurzweil and 4 others. Day 100. Today we hit a painful milestone, it marks the 100th day since my little brother, Danny Fenster, was wrongly detained in Myanmar, apparently, simply for being a journalist. Today, like every day, we are calling on the military in Myanmar to release Danny on humanitarian grounds and allow him to come home to us.”\n\n[A series of comments from social media]\n\n“Dominic Horner Sending lots of love to you and your family”\n\n“Jane Gleeson Sending continued prayers and love!”\n\n“Julie Muszynski I’m so sorry for all of you…”\n\n“Kim Maher Praying [praying hands emojis]”\n\n“Linda Finkelburg Stay strong.

He opens a bag of coffee to find a hidden note inside one of the packets.]\n\nNote: “Granola bar. TAL. Love you.”\n\n[Danny takes out the box of granola bars, opens it, and dumps the wrapped bars out. He examines and touches each bar, clearly looking for something hidden. He looks dismayed, and then peers inside the empty box to discover a small microSD card taped inside.]\n\nIt took several days of begging and bribing before another prisoner was able to help me set the terms of an hourly lease on an MP3 player from one of the other detainees.\n\nI walked as casually as I could back to my cell.\n\n<slide> [Danny inserts the microSD card into the MP3 player and turns up the volume.] <click> <tap tap tap>\n\n“Baby there’s room in here… Just enough for two in here…”\n\nIt was Juliana’s voice.\n\n“Ain’t nobody but you and me in here…”\n\nI replayed it again.

I love you babe. So so much. Stay strong, for me, for us! LOVE YOU, Ju”\n\nSomehow, Juliana had also downloaded the entire thirty-year archive of my favorite podcast and stuffed it all on that mircoSD card. As soon as I stopped replaying her singing, I heard another familiar voice...\n\n“From WBEZ Chicago… It’s THIS AMERICAN LIFE. I’m Ira Glass… stay with us…”\n\nFor whatever reason (which Juliana would later claim was not intentional), the first episode to play was from 2011, Episode 448: \"Adventure!”\n\nIn Act One, an expat Minnesotan named \"Luke\" gets pulled into a minor street brawl in Shenzhen, China, then flees. A few days later the police come asking questions, and then they lock him up.\n\n“It was, like, a Tuesday I think. I went in, and they're like, ‘We'll be back on Friday to let you know what's going on.’ And honestly, at that time I thought I was going to be released on Friday…\n\n“... I was thinking, OK, three nights, four nights, this is no problem. I'm kind of an adventurous soul. At this point, I'm still fairly calm. Like, well, I'm in a Chinese jail, this is crazy, but what a story.”\n\n“And in the end, how long did you end up staying in this detention center?”\n\n“Eight months…\n\nEight months.”\n\n“The cell was a rectangle, 10 by 15 feet… During storms, you couldn't hide from the rain blowing in, so everyone would get drenched… …up at 7, then breakfast… …thin rice water broth… … nap from 11:30 to 1:30… …The days became all the same — boredom punctuated by the occasional spasm of extreme emotion.” “In classic adventure stories, like The Odyssey, there isn't much fun. There's pain, fear, and death, and occasionally, if you're lucky… …small transformations.”\n\nOn a Friday afternoon that November, in a military court within the prison compound, I was found guilty of a slew of arcane crimes, including causing offense to the military, and sentenced to eleven years with hard labor.\n\nI was marched to the prison office, stripped of my street clothes and dressed in prison blues.\n\nBy the time I made it back to my cell, the others had been locked in for the night. I spent that evening desolate and crying, trying to comprehend the weight of eleven years.\n\nThat proved impossible, and so by the morning I'd convinced myself that, actually, I had to be convicted in order to be pardoned.\n\n“Why else would they give you a Covid test?”\n\nSure enough, on Monday morning, I was awoken earlier than everyone else.\n\n<unlock> “Pack up.”\n\nI never got to say goodbye.\n\nBy that evening, Burmese police were handing me over to a scrum of men, including the late Bill Richardson, former New Mexico governor, who'd made a second career negotiating the release of Americans detained abroad. They said they had a chartered jet taxing outside for me.\n\nIt had been six months.\n\nForeigners not deported directly from prison had to book tickets ten days before their departure so the government could monitor comings and goings.\n\nDanny on phone: “Hey babe... Oh, nothing much… What's new with you?”\n\nNovember 15th, 2021: Juliana booked her ticket that night.\n\nI thought I'd gone to Myanmar to learn how to defeat dictators, but Burmese journalists knew all along that such defeats are never final.\n\n“The New York Times U.S. Journalist Danny Fenster Is Freed From Myanmar Prison The release was a rare positive development in the country, which has been torn by violence since a February coup.”\n\n“The Detroit Jewish News Home Free: After Six Months in a Myanmar Prison, Journalist is with His Family in Huntington Woods”\n\n“Deadline Detroit With Hugs And A Haircut, Danny Fenster Readjusts In A Familiar Home Near Detroit - His Family's”\n\n“MICHIGAN Fenster after being freed from Myanmar: ‘I'm really happy to be on my way home' Detroit News staff and wire reports”\n\n“BBC Danny Fenster: US journalist freed from Myanmar jail”\n\nThe lesson is to keep reporting anyway..\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Amy Kurzweil and 4 others. November 17, 2021 Day 178. Home Sweet Home. #BringDannyHome”\n\nto record for tomorrow…\n\n…the stories that today's victors would prefer we forget.\n\n“Hey Dan? Can you baste the turkey? I'm going to spin class.” “OK.” “And the Rubins are downstairs – they want to say hi. The Detroit Jewish News will stop by at 4. They just want a picture, then they'll leave us alone.” “OK, Ma—” “What time does she land?” “Soon.”\n\nBecause to suffer sucks, so you simply tell…\n\n“Danny!” “I can’t believe you’re home!” “You lost the man bun!” “You made it!” “We’re so happy you’re here.” “Mmmmwah! So handsome!” “Phew!”\n\n“Hey Dan… Dad’s waiting for ya in the car.”\n\nAnd sometimes, if you’re lucky…\n\n…you, find, in the telling…\n\n…that suffering transformed.\n\n[Danny and Juliana are reunited at the airport, embracing.]"

            "content": "With rare exceptions, phones are pretty boring these days. The good news is, a boatload of those rare exceptions are about to show up at once, courtesy of Mobile World Congress.\n\nThe tech industry’s biggest mobile show may not quite have the clout it once did, when the likes of Samsung, Sony, LG, and HTC showcased new flagships there each year, but it still attracts more phone launches than CES does two months earlier. It’s especially popular with the Chinese manufacturers who are still fighting for space in the global market, along with niche manufacturers who turn up with extra-durable “rugged” devices, or battery beasts that are more power bank than phone.\n\nThis year’s biggest event is expected to be Xiaomi’s launch on Saturday. Ever eclectic, it’s teased tablets, super-slim power banks, earbuds, and smart trackers among its MWC lineup, but all eyes will be on the Leitzphone. This collaboration between Xiaomi and Leica takes the former’s Xiaomi 17 Ultra — follow-up to one of the absolute best cameras in any phone last year — and slaps a rotating camera ring on the back, allowing you to physically scroll through the continuous optical zoom the phone’s telephoto provides. It’s a double whammy of novel camera hardware that may sit right on the edge of “gimmick” territory, but is at least a variation from the same old stuff.\n\nXiaomi should reveal an updated global version of its collaboration with Leica. Image: Xiaomi\n\nHonor will be up next, with its event set for Sunday. The company has already revealed the MagicPad 4 — apparently the thinnest fully fledged tablet around — and teased its next-generation foldable phone, also expected to be the world’s thinnest. But much more exciting than either is what the company promises will be a proper look at its so-called Robot Phone, first teased late last year in a concept video and shown in static prototype form at CES last month.\n\nFrom what we’ve seen, it’s certainly more phone than robot, but the gimbal-stabilized camera arm that unfolds out of the phone’s back is undeniably novel. It’s like a cross between a smartphone and a DJI Osmo Pocket, with teasers hinting at AI features and a cheery, WALL-E-esque sense of character. With Honor also teasing the reveal of its first foray into full humanoid robotics, expect it to lean hard on its robot credentials.\n\nI have my doubts about how realistic Tecno’s magnetic modular concept phone is, but it does look pretty slick. Image: Tecno\n\nAnd those are just the big two. Expect to see more from Nothing, which is launching its Phone 4A series and a new pair of over-ear headphones at its own event on March 5th, but is almost certain to tease more details on both over the next few days. Tecno has promised a modular, magnetic concept smartphone with attachable lenses and action camera; Vivo has announced some sort of reveal of its camera-centric X300 Ultra flagship; and Lenovo, which simply loves to bring a weird and wacky concept device to the show, is teasing its own announcements.\n\nWill anything be as silly as last year’s Realme concept, which strapped a DSLR telephoto onto the back of a smartphone? Image: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nWhen you’re competing with Apple for attention, playing it safe won’t get you very far\n\nAnd you can’t blame them, not least when Apple has waded in to promise its own week of announcements starting… Monday, the same day that MWC officially kicks off. In true Apple fashion, we don’t know for sure what’s coming, but affordable MacBooks and the midrange iPhone 17E have both been heavily tipped. When you’re competing with Apple for attention, playing it safe won’t get you very far.\n\nI’m at least half a cynic when it comes to these outlandish hardware announcements. The ones that you can actually buy are often little more than gimmicks, and the ones you can’t usually feel like no more than marketing stunts. But in the past 10 days, we’ve had the Pixel 10A and Galaxy S26 in quick succession, both minimal upgrades that lean on fractional spec bumps and AI additions to justify their existence. I wouldn’t hold my breath for next week’s iPhone 17E to revolutionize much either. As Allison Johnson put it in her S26 Ultra preview this week, “hardware thrills are hard to get these days.” MWC has them in spades."

Since it’s a global show, that includes all manner of announcements of phones, tablets, and wearables that won’t necessarily release in the US.\n\nXiaomi has already teased a European launch for its 17 and 17 Ultra flagships, Honor is promising not only its Robot Phone but a full pivot to humanoid robotics, and Nothing is almost certain to drop more details on its Phone 4A ahead of a planned London launch on March 5th.\n\nThe likes of Samsung and Google will be there too, but mostly to talk about the already-announced 10A and S26 models, while Apple is launching something during the same week as MWC, but not actually in Barcelona.\n\nWe’ll also be looking out for oddities. Last year featured camera phone concepts with detachable lenses, a Lenovo laptop with a folding screen, and an Infinix handset with a solar panel in its back.

            "content": "Weeks after stepping down as CEO from food delivery service Zomato and its parent Eternal, Indian entrepreneur Deepinder Goyal is back with a $54 million raise for wearable startup Temple, part of what the 43-year-old earlier described as a shift toward “higher-risk exploration and experimentation.”\n\nOn Friday, Goyal said in a post on X that Temple had raised funds in a friends-and-family round from founder friends and early Zomato backers, at a post-money valuation of about $190 million. More than 30 employees participated at the same valuation, he said.\n\nGoyal stepped down as chief executive of Zomato and its parent, Eternal, in January, handing the role to Albinder Dhindsa, who leads the quick-commerce unit Blinkit. The move marked a major transition for Goyal after nearly two decades at the helm of the food delivery company he co-founded in 2008.\n\nTemple is one of the clearest expressions yet of that shift. The startup is focused on building a high-performance wearable for elite athletes, an area Goyal has described as ripe for deeper technological innovation.\n\nDuring a January conversation with podcaster Raj Shamani, Goyal described Temple’s wearable as a sensor designed to sit on the wearer’s temple and continuously track cerebral blood flow.\n\nIn a separate post on X earlier Friday, he said Temple aims to build what he called “the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes,” claiming the device would measure metrics that existing wearables cannot. He also outlined an expansive hiring push spanning embedded systems, computational neuroscience, and brain–computer interface engineering.\n\nWe're recruiting at @temple.\n\n\n\nAt Temple, we are building the ultimate wearable for elite performance athletes. A device that measures what no other wearable in the world measures, with a level of precision that doesn't exist yet.\n\n\n\nTo build it, we need people who are obsessive… pic.twitter.com/iCHaMUwdEw — Deepinder Goyal (@deepigoyal) February 27, 2026\n\nThe startup is entering an increasingly crowded and well-funded wearables market, where companies such as Whoop, Oura, and Garmin have spent years refining devices that track sleep, recovery, and athletic performance. Whether Temple can meaningfully differentiate its technology remains an open question.\n\nThe push into Temple is part of a broader shift in Goyal’s investment focus. In October 2025, he said he had committed $25 million of his own capital to another new venture, Continue Research, which is exploring ways to extend human lifespan. He is also a co-founder of aviation startup LAT Aerospace, which recently expanded into defense technology with the acquisition of early-stage firm Sharang Shakti.\n\nGoyal built his reputation at Zomato, which he co-founded with Pankaj Chaddah and spent nearly two decades building into one of India’s largest food delivery platforms before stepping down as chief executive earlier this year.\n\nChaddah exited the company in 2018, as Zomato continued to consolidate its position through acquisitions, including the purchase of Uber Eats’ India business in 2020 and grocery delivery platform Blinkit — then known as Grofers — for $568 million in 2022.\n\nBefore Temple, Goyal had also backed health and fitness startups, including Ultrahuman, an India-based wearable maker that competes with Oura’s smart ring, underscoring his growing focus on performance and health technology.\n\nGoyal declined to comment further on Temple."

The new funding consists of a $50 billion investment from Amazon as well as $30 billion each from Nvidia and SoftBank, against a $730 billion pre-money valuation.\n\nNotably, the round remains open, and OpenAI expects more investors to join as it proceeds.\n\n“We are entering a new phase where frontier AI moves from research into daily use at global scale,” OpenAI said. “Leadership will be defined by who can scale infrastructure fast enough to meet demand, and turn that capacity into products people rely on.”\n\nAs part of the investment, OpenAI is launching significant infrastructure partnerships with both Amazon and Nvidia. As in previous rounds, it is likely that a significant portion of the dollar amount comes in the form of services rather than cash, although the precise split was not disclosed.\n\nThe company’s previous round closed in March 2025, raising $40 billion against a $300 billion valuation. At the time, it was the largest private funding round on record.\n\nAs part of its Amazon partnership, OpenAI plans to develop a new “stateful runtime environment” where OpenAI models will run on Amazon’s Bedrock platform. The company will also expand its previously announced AWS partnership, which committed $38 billion in compute services, by $100 billion. OpenAI has committed to consuming at least 2GW of AWS Tranium compute as part of the deal, and also plans to build custom models to support Amazon consumer products.\n\n“We have lots of developers and companies eager to run services powered by OpenAI models on AWS,” said Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in a statement, “and our unique collaboration with OpenAI to provide stateful runtime environments will change what’s possible for customers building AI apps and agents.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

OpenAI’s announcement confirms the funding split, but says only that the additional $35 billion will arrive “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.”\n\nOpenAI gave fewer details on the Nvidia partnership, but said it had committed to using “3GW of dedicated inference capacity and 2GW of training on Vera Rubin systems” as part of the deal.\n\nNvidia’s participation in the round has been the subject of intense speculation, particularly as reports of a $100 billion investment in September gave way to reports of a smaller investment in the months that followed.\n\nIn January, Huang dismissed the idea that Nvidia was backing away from OpenAI, saying, “we will invest a great deal of money. I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible.”"

            "content": "A rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade. Hours after IDC published its report, another analyst firm, Counterpoint, made a similar prediction and said the market will dip by 12% this year.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\n\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Lower-end smartphones are likely to be affected the most, especially as LPDDR4 supply is shrinking faster than expected. OEMs are already responding with launch delays, streamlined portfolios, and specification trade-offs. We have also observed 10% to 20% price increases across some Android OEM portfolios in January 2026,” Principal Analyst Yang Wang said.\n\nImage Credits: Counterpoint\n\nThe firm also predicted that pricing volatility amid handsets will also drive the second-hand devices market up.\n\nEarlier this year, Nothing co-founder and CEO Carl Pei also warned that smartphones will cost more in 2026 as memory costs for smartphones rise. “Brands now face a simple choice: raise prices by 30% or more in some cases, or downgrade specs. The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added."

            "content": "After years of appeals, Google has finally received conditional approval to export high-precision geographic information out of South Korea, a move that opens the door to let the company provide proper Google Maps services in the country, such as walking and real-time driving directions.\n\nThe move reverses a long-standing policy on data restrictions that had essentially made Google Maps and Apple Maps non-functional in the country. Google has so far provided maps services in South Korea using high-resolution, 1:5,000 scale map data, but without the ability to export that data to its servers, the company couldn’t offer features like turn-by-turn navigation or detailed listings for businesses.\n\nSouth Korea has resisted Google’s appeals since 2011, arguing that the company’s precise satellite maps could endanger national security by exposing sensitive military sites when combined with commercial imagery and online data. Given that South Korea remains technically at war with North Korea, the government is cautious about exposing such locations, and had until now demanded Google set up a data center in the country and obscure sensitive locations.\n\nThe green light comes with strict rules designed to protect sensitive military and infrastructure sites. The South Korean government will verify compliance before any data leaves the country; any images of South Korean territory used in Google Maps and Google Earth must comply with national security regulations; and historical imagery in Google Earth and Street View must obscure sensitive military sites. Google is also required to either remove or limit coordinate data for South Korean locations, and only essential data for navigation and routing can be exported.\n\nThe government also requires all data processing to be done on servers operated by Google’s local partners. Sensitive topographic and military data remain off-limits, and any updates to military or security sites must be carried out promptly on domestic servers at the government’s request.\n\nGoogle did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nThe move will no doubt send ripples through Korea’s domestic maps market, which has seen local navigation apps such as Naver Map, T Map, and Kakao Map thrive in the relative absence of providers like Google or Apple.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The government is urging Google to help grow South Korea’s geospatial industry so that exporting the data benefits not just the tech giant, but also domestic innovation and economic growth.\n\nGoogle has not yet said if it would set up a data center in South Korea. The company operates an array of data centers in Asia, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia.\n\nThe government also outlined new measures to handle potential security incidents related to the export of high-resolution maps. The ministry said it would work with Google to set up a “security incident prevention and response framework” to manage potential risks before any data leaves the country. For situations involving imminent threats to national security, a technical “red button” mechanism will be implemented, allowing for rapid emergency response.\n\nIn addition, South Korea will require a local officer to be stationed in-country to maintain constant communication with the government and ensure smooth handling of any security incidents."

            "content": "Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.\n\nThe Ring Pro, Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life — compared with four to six days on the Ring Air — and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.\n\nUltrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — ruled in Oura’s favor in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.\n\nIn August 2025, Ultrahuman also filed a separate patent infringement case against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.\n\nMeanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.\n\nDespite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It reported $64 million in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.\n\nAlongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nKumar said Jade is designed to move beyond retrospective health summaries toward real-time, actionable guidance.\n\nUltrahuman’s Jade AI system Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\n“Most AI tools today look backward at your data,” he said. “Jade is built to react to your health in real time and surface actions users can take.”\n\nKumar said Jade will be available to all Ultrahuman users, including those using the older Ring Air, and does not currently require a subscription.\n\nThe Ring Pro features a redesigned heart-rate sensing architecture for improved signal quality during sleep and a new dual-core processor to enhance data accuracy and on-device computing. The device can store up to 250 days of health data and weighs about 5% to 6% more than the Ring Air, launched in July 2023 at $349.\n\nUltrahuman has also introduced a Pro Charger with up to 45 days of battery life to support on-the-go charging and enable faster updates and diagnostics through direct case connectivity. The charger also supports wireless charging via Qi, the same standard used by most modern smartphones.\n\nUltrahuman’s Pro Charger Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\nWomen account for about 68% of Ultrahuman’s user base, up from roughly 65% a year earlier, Kumar said, reflecting strong adoption of the startup’s women’s health features.\n\nUltrahuman also offers subscription-based services across its broader health platform, including a coaching and recovery program called PowerPlugs, the Blood Vision metabolic panel, Ultrahuman Home, and a continuous glucose monitoring offering. Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.\n\nUltrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.\n\nGlobal smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.\n\nJain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.\n\nSeparate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.\n\nFounded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.\n\nUltrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months."

Recent examples include Stripe, which this week said it would allow employees to sell shares at a $159 billion valuation, as well as Clay, ElevenLabs, and Linear.\n\nBeyond retention and to help staff cover tax bills triggered when RSUs vest, they relieve pressure on management to pursue an IPO before the company is ready."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Belt-drive bikes offer some huge upsides. First, they usually require less maintenance, with many belts often lasting twice as long as a typical chain. Second, there’s no grease to speak of, and therefore, no black smudges on your work pants. Third, in the case of the Soltera 3, the belt comes from the Gates brand, whose drivetrain belts are as good as it gets. Belt-drive bikes are silent and often smoother than their chain-driven counterparts.\n\nThat said, the inclusion of a low-maintenance element such as a belt drive paired with hydraulic disc brakes, which require bleeding roughly every year, struck me as an odd choice. If Aventon wanted to make the Soltera 3 as hands-off as possible, cable-actuated brakes would have been a more intuitive choice.\n\nThe other thing that immediately jumps out about the Soltera 3 is its relatively light weight. At 37 pounds, the Soltera 3 is heavy for an analog bike. But it’s certainly not heavy for an ebike, and it’s nearly as stiff, nimble, and navigable as a conventional bicycle. One issue I’ve always had with ebikes is their heft. Given that they’re often made to replace a car, they’re built with load bearing in mind. Also, ebike batteries are heavy.\n\nAdding to that sense of “this is just like my other bikes,” the Soltera 3 simply looks cool, which is often not the case when it comes to ebikes. The matte black my tester bike arrived in looks cool because matte black almost never doesn’t look cool. (Additionally, the Soltera 3 is available in dark matte blue and a sleek silver.) But beyond the finish, the bike’s geometry; its wide, almost perfectly flat handlebars; and its narrow (by ebike standards) 700 x 36 tires make it feel closer in DNA to a road bike than a traditional ebike.\n\nButton Press\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nI’m 6′4′′, and the extra large Soltera 3 that I tested was at a maximum saddle height. It was suitable for me, but I couldn’t recommend anyone bigger than me riding the Soltera 3. That said, with four sizes ranging from small to extra large, the line covers a wide swath of riders, ranging from my height all the way down to 5′ tall."

Unlike a pedometer or sports watch, it’s not going to incentivize you to get active. Unlike a continuous glucose monitor, it’s not going to help you lose weight. A gigantic blood pressure cuff isn’t exactly a gorgeous or enticing accessory to wear. In fact, getting your arm squeezed so tight can be downright claustrophobic.\n\nBut there’s a reason why blood pressure is one of the first tests you get at the doctor’s office. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the top killers in the United States. It can result in conditions like heart attacks or strokes. There are usually no symptoms; hypertension is called “the silent killer” for a reason. Nearly one in three people worldwide has it. And unlike diseases like cancer, we already have simple, readily available tools to treat it, like exercise and reducing the amount of salt that you eat.\n\nLast year, a few fitness trackers debuted hypertension notifications in their suite of features—most notably, the Apple Watch. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Aktiia Hilo band does not merely notify you when you have signs of hypertension. It monitors your blood pressure up to 25 times a day, 24 hours a day. Aktiia reached out to me for testing when it launched; WIRED is the first in the United States to test it. This device could change many lives for the better when it goes on sale in the US later this year. (It's available now in some countries.)\n\nLight and Sound\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo comes in two parts—the slim, cuffless band you wear every day and a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff you use to calibrate the device every month or so. Both have to be connected to the Hilo app (iOS, Android). Once both are connected, the app will remind you to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand and to sit and relax with your back supported for at least five minutes."

            "content": "When Netflix dropped the first season of Love Is Blind in February 2020, it offered a reprieve from the washboard abs that normally seem like a casting requirement for reality TV shows.\n\nThe premise—that couples get engaged “sight unseen” after talking to each other through pods, then, following a big reveal, decide if they want to get married—featured just the right amount of mess. Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success.\n\nWhile race still comes up, it’s often in a superficial and offensive way. Contestants either find themselves struggling with the fact that their match is a person of color, or dealing with unaddressed internalized racism that downplays their own worth while prioritizing whiteness in a partner—a worthwhile topic that deserves far more nuance or a therapist’s involvement.\n\nBroadly, Love Is Blind seems to be pushing conservative ideals—trad wives, divorce shaming, and big families even when contestants clearly aren’t enthusiastic about the idea of having kids.\n\nKinetic Content, which produces Love Is Blind, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen 28-year-old Emma Betsinger of the current Ohio season discusses the scars on her arms—a result of surgeries due to her birthmarks—with podmate Steven Sunday, a 32-year-old who works in finance, he grills her about how she lost her virginity instead of asking thoughtful questions. Betsinger’s health issues have made her hesitant to have children, but instead of taking her at her word, the men she dates stress that she would make a great mother.\n\nThen there’s fast-talking Henderson, 31, who, despite not having a job besides the day trading he claims to do, expects his fiancée Ashley Carpenter, a 34-year-old claims manager, to pack up and move to either Arizona or Florida, her possible promotion be damned. Carpenter’s dad, a MAGA “patriarch,” barely lets his wife speak during the family’s meeting with Henderson and later touts his own daughter’s attractiveness as being “dyn-o-mite.”\n\nAt a time when women are outpacing men in obtaining college degrees and are narrowing the pay gap in some cities, some of the guys in Love Is Blind’s recent seasons also seem to react poorly to having high-achieving partners.\n\nLast year in Denver, Jordan Keltner couldn’t seem to move past his insecurities around fiancée Megan Walerius’ wealth, ultimately leading to their breakup after he said he was too “tired” to have conversations with her after work or keep up with her rich-person hobbies. This season, Fusco, a 33-year-old account executive, gets a tour of his doctor fiancée Jessica Barrett's multi-bedroom Ohio home and later demeans her for not going to pilates every day. “I don't care if she’s a neurosurgeon or if she’s a goddamn $100-million trust fund,\" he says, while complaining about their lack of sexual chemistry before spending a chunk of time trying to convince already-engaged contestant Bri McNess that she needs a “dominant” man like him."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

            "content": "Hair loss isn’t always dramatic. It can be incremental. You start noticing a bit more scalp in harsh bathroom lighting; a tiny bald spot when you tie your hair up in a ponytail. The shower drain is more clogged than usual. Not long ago, hair loss treatments meant topical remedies, supplements, or a flight to Turkey. Luckily, red light therapy brings the potential for hair regrowth into your home—no clinical appointment required.\n\nBeyond skin rejuvenation, research suggests red light therapy can help energize hair follicles, increase blood circulation in the scalp, reduce inflammation, and lower dihydrotestosterone levels—a hormone that causes hair loss and thinning. Red light therapy also supports adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which helps provide oxygen and blood flow to the scalp and triggers follicles to remain in the hair growth phase.\n\nTo determine the best red light therapy for hair growth, I tapped three WIRED tech reviewers who've dealt with hair loss themselves. We assessed red light therapy caps, hands-free helmets with full scalp coverage, and low-level laser therapy or photobiomodulation devices for 16 weeks. Along the way, we reviewed the research, spoke with dermatologists, and tracked ease of use. These are the favorites that produced meaningful results and earned our trust.\n\nBe sure to check out our other hair care guides, including Best Dry Shampoos, Best Heat Protectant Sprays, and Best Hair Dryers.\n\nBest Red Light Helmet\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet $860 CurrentBody WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Simple device with only one button and a charging port\n\nBluetooth-enabled so you can listen to your own tunes during treatment\n\nComes with a stand for easy storage\n\nObserved new hair on scalp after 12-ish weeks TIRED Need to use daily for at least four months to achieve results, and use regularly (nearly every day) for maintenance\n\nEven the smallest helmet size is large\n\nBuffer cups can snag and pull hair during helmet removal\n\nEar cups can be somewhat difficult to adjust while worn\n\nCurrentBody's LED Hair Growth Helmet is a wearable, cord-free, Bluetooth-enabled device aimed at improving hair’s density, thickness, and overall condition. Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee say they’ve identified more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses tied to identity theft connected to four major breaches involving data broker firms. The estimate was released Friday in a minority report stemming from a months-long inquiry into data broker practices launched by United States senator Maggie Hassan.\n\nHassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the JEC’s ranking member, sent investigative requests to five major data brokers—Comscore, Findem, IQVIA Digital, Telesign, and 6Sense Insights—in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines using “no index” instructions that tell web crawlers not to list the page.\n\nScammers are shown to use the kind of sensitive data that companies like these hold—including identifiers like dates of birth, addresses, and even Social Security numbers—to target victims with personalized fraud.\n\nFour of the companies took steps after Hassan’s outreach to improve access to opt-out options, including by removing the “no index” code, adding more prominent links, and posting guidance on exercising privacy rights.\n\nFindem, however, did not respond to Hassan or to committee staff follow-up, and staff said the company has not removed the “no index” code from its page. WIRED’s calls to Findem on Thursday went unanswered.\n\nThe report says Findem’s “failure to respond” to the lawmakers’ inquiries raises “serious, broad questions about its responsiveness to opt-out requests and commitment to data privacy,” adding that its own mandatory disclosures from 2024 show the company “did not process 80 percent of privacy requests from consumers and other parties,” citing “insufficient data.”\n\nIQVIA, 6sense, and Comscore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Telesign routes press inquiries through an online form that requires reporters to consent to receiving marketing communications, which was not used for that reason; instead, a company email address that appeared in previously leaked breach data was tried."

            "content": "The line between iPad and MacBook may get a little more blurred this year. Bloomberg reports that Apple is working on a touchscreen MacBook Pro with OLED screen to be released by the end of 2026.\n\nIt's a product I never expected to see anytime soon. For the past 15 years, Apple executives have publicly dismissed the idea of putting touchscreens on a MacBook, saying it would be uncomfortable to operate. Steve Jobs told a crowd at an Apple event that the company did \"tons of user testing\" on putting touchscreens on MacBooks and decided against it because, he said, \"It doesn't work. It's ergonomically terrible.\"\n\nWatch this: New Touchscreen MacBook Details Emerge, Plus What to Expect at Apple's Big Event 05:19\n\nWhile previewing Mac OS X Lion in 2010, Jobs explained the main issue was comfort, saying, \"After a short period of time you start to fatigue, and after an extended period of time your arm wants to fall off.\"\n\nSo if Bloomberg's reporting is correct, certainly someone at Apple believes differently now. But before we cry out how this isn't what Steve Jobs wanted, let's not forget that Jobs did say Apple did \"tons\" of user testing. It was something the company has been curious about. Maybe in the past 15 years, something changed.\n\nIn this week's episode of One More Thing, embedded above, I go over the details from the Bloomberg report on how it might function. MacOS reportedly would only reveal touch menus when a finger hits the screen, helping it just complement the typical point-and-click interface. Certainly this could avoid criticism Microsoft faced by overhauling its OS in the Windows 8 launch when it moved to a hybrid interface, alienating longtime users.\n\nThis rumored device is for the end of the year, but Apple may have plenty of other gadgets to play with in the next week. Tim Cook teased that the company will be announcing new products starting on Monday. The company is expected to release a new iPhone 17e, along with updated models of the iPad and Mac lineup -- maybe as many as five different products.\n\nApple is holding an invitation-only experience on Wednesday March 4 in New York City, and I'll be there to cover whatever happens and will give my first impressions and full report for what one more thing (or many things) will have folks buzzing.\n\nFor more One More Thing, subscribe to our YouTube page to catch Bridget Carey breaking down the latest Apple news and issues every Friday."

Pokemon Day promises to be chock-full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world. The juggernaut franchise is celebrating its 30th anniversary, so it's safe to assume there will be juicy information included in this Pokemon Presents stream.\n\nThere was plenty of excitement leading up to the main event. Pokemon TCG Pocket released the Paldean Wonders card set expansion, and The Pokemon Company revealed that FireRed and LeafGreen are getting Switch ports with Pokemon Home compatibility. Now the stage is set for The Pokemon Company to reveal new mainline Pokemon games for the Switch and Switch 2.\n\nHere's when The Pokemon Company goes live with its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year, setting audience expectations for what we can expect to see from the world of pocket monsters in 2026.\n\nWhat time is the Pokemon Presents stream on Pokemon Day?\n\nThe first Pokemon Presents livestream of the year is happening now. The show began bright and early for American audiences, so I hope you didn't sleep in.\n\nHere's when Friday's Pokemon Day livestream began in your time zone:\n\nGMT : 2 p.m.\n\n: 2 p.m. ET: 9 a.m.\n\n9 a.m. CT: 8 a.m.\n\n8 a.m. MT: 7 a.m.\n\n7 a.m. PT: 6 a.m.\n\nHow to watch the February Pokemon Presents livestream\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, so you can view the announcement on any of its social media channels.\n\nWhile I recommend watching the stream on The Pokemon Company's YouTube or Twitch channels, you can also keep up with the announcements on TikTok. Regular updates will also be posted to the company's Instagram account throughout the event.\n\nWhat will be announced on Pokemon Day 2026?\n\nIt's safe to assume that the February Pokemon Presents livestream will feature some long-anticipated reveals, since 2026 is a big year for the Pokemon brand.\n\nThe livestream marks the 30th anniversary of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green, the original Pokemon games for the Game Boy, being released in Japan. We know the stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, making it one of the longest Pokemon Presents showcases ever.\n\nI suspect the livestream will serve as a victory lap celebrating Pokemon's cultural impact before pivoting to the future and showing fans what's coming next.\n\nAnd what treats are in store for tomorrow's event? I expect to see updates and freebies for Pokemon mobile games first, since these are some of the big moneymakers. If this Pokemon Day presentation mirrors the one from last year, we'll be treated to some goodies in Pokemon Go, Pokemon Masters EX, Pokemon Cafe ReMix and Pokemon TCG Pocket. We might also see an announcement for a special Pokemon Scarlet and Violet raid event and Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega stone distributions.\n\nMega stone distributions are likely to be freebies on Pokemon Day. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNET\n\nAfter celebrating the games that have already been released, it's likely the presentation will pivot to what's coming next. We'll almost certainly get a reminder that Nintendo Switch ports of Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen are available starting on Pokemon Day. I expect the biggest news will be a concrete release date for Pokemon's big new competitive game, Pokemon Champions, which is slated to come out in time for the Pokemon World Championships 2026.\n\nIf we're really lucky, we might even hear about the 10th generation of mainline Pokemon games. While Game Freak has unmoored itself from a consistent release schedule, we're certainly due to see the rumored Pokemon Wind and Wave. While the infamous Teraleak hints toward what the development studio might show off next, it's high time we get a glimpse of what the next big Pokemon games are really all about."

            "content": "Finding an inexpensive, quality inkjet printer isn't a challenge. But getting affordable replacement ink is another matter entirely.\n\nYou might be shocked to learn that replacement ink cartridges can cost as much as the printer itself, if not more. It's because printers are often sold at a loss, with the company expecting to make its profit on the ink.\n\nThis strategy, also known as the \"razor-and-blades model,\" is common in consumer goods, including printers, coffee makers (the ones that use disposable pods) and its namesake, shaving razors.\n\nPrinter manufacturers, however, claim there are several reasons why ink costs so much, beyond revenue. Here are the main reasons why printer ink is so expensive.\n\nThe razor blade business\n\nThe razor-and-blade business model provides a continued revenue stream for printer-makers after a customer buys the hardware. It also locks that customer into an ecosystem. Just as some razor handles are compatible with only a specific blade, printers support only certain inkjet or toner cartridges.\n\nManufacturers typically offer different printer models, but they likely use different cartridges that aren't interchangeable. The cartridges also aren't refillable by design. While it may seem manipulative, this business model is legal and common practice. It also keeps prices high due to a lack of competition.\n\nIt's all proprietary (aka intellectual property)\n\nThanasi/Getty\n\nAnother way consumers are locked into a closed ecosystem is that many ink and toner cartridges contain chipsets that communicate with the printer, such as the amount of ink or toner left, so the printer can estimate how many pages it can print. They also verify whether the cartridge is authentic (i.e., from the printer manufacturer) or has been refilled. In either case, the printer could reject the cartridge.\n\nWhile some third-party suppliers have found ways around this, printer cartridges are proprietary, the intellectual property of the original manufacturer. Customers are usually limited in replacement options other than buying from their printer's original equipment manufacturer.\n\nThis isn't about the cost of research and manufacturing, or at least, not just about that. Printer-makers claim that their technology ensures consumers get the best print quality from their ink or toner, as well as proper performance and accurate color or monochrome prints.\n\nFor example, inkjet printer ink is formulated to flow smoothly through the tiny printhead nozzles, while laser printer toner powder must be heated and applied evenly. That ink or toner also has to dry quickly on paper without smudging, which is another key reason. The official cartridges also include security features that manufacturers claim protect against malware.\n\nSo, although cartridges look simple on the outside, their embedded technology adds to manufacturing costs. Companies say this helps ensure high print quality, but consumer advocacy groups say it is designed to keep out competition while shifting the cost to users.\n\nIf you print often, expect to spend more on consumables\n\nGettyimages/Photoplus magazine\n\nObviously, the more ink or toner used, the sooner replenishment is needed. This is especially the case with inkjet printers, as cartridges often contain a low yield of ink (between 150 to 300 pages). And, if the printer uses multiple cartridges, those costs add up quickly. If you run out of one color, you might not even be able to print black-and-white documents.\n\nWorse, new inkjet printers include \"starter ink cartridges\" that offer even lower yields. Laser printer toner cartridges also require replacing, but they tend to have higher yields than their inkjet counterparts.\n\nAlso, if you don't print often, the ink in the cartridges can dry out, requiring replacement before you can print anything.\n\nHow to reduce printer ink costs\n\nEpson/CNET\n\nThere's no way around it: Inkjet printers need ink, which will eventually run out. But there are a few ways to save some money.\n\nHigh-yield cartridges\n\nSome printers support high-yield ink or toner cartridges, which double the output of standard options. They cost a bit more, but you may be able to reduce the frequency of ink replacements. They also might be cheaper per page printed.\n\nRefillable ink\n\nRefillable inkjet printers, also known as supertank printers, have gained popularity. As the name suggests, a user pours ink into tanks built into the printer, much like refilling a soap bottle. Refillable inks are cheaper than ink cartridges and offer a much higher yield. (They also produce less waste in general.) However, the printers themselves are more expensive to purchase upfront.\n\nHP\n\nSubscription programs\n\nHP offers its Instant Ink program, which automatically ships you a replacement when ink runs low (the printer sends this info to HP when connected to Wi-Fi). Starting at $1.79 a month, HP sends new high-yield cartridges only when needed and recycles your old cartridges to reduce e-waste. HP says Instant Ink offers a savings of up to 50% when compared to buying off the shelf, and most Wi-Fi-enabled HP printers support the program.\n\nEpson launched a new service called ReadyPrint, where, for a monthly fee (starting at $15), you get a printer and unlimited refillable ink. ReadyPrint is available only on select models.\n\nPrint in draft mode and limit color\n\nOftentimes, lower-quality draft mode is more than sufficient for most print jobs. This can help increase page yields. Nearly all inkjet printers can output in color, but that doesn't mean you should. Make sure you disable color in your print settings and enable it only when needed.\n\nConsider a laser printer\n\nLaser toner cartridge. Getty Images/Smith Collection\n\nEvaluate the amount and type of printing you plan to do. If it's mostly black-and-white documents, it may be more economical to invest in a laser printer, since toner offers higher yields and doesn't dry out between infrequent uses.\n\nThen, if you need to occasionally print color or photos, print them professionally at FedEx, pharmacies like CVS and any number of local or online photo print shops. In the long run, this might be cheaper than owning your own color printer if you don't print regularly.\n\nThird-party supplies\n\nThird-party ink supplies can offer significant savings, but printer manufacturers have strongly fought against this option. They've even implemented measures to prevent their use. However, it's not illegal for consumers to use third-party inks. Before you choose this option, know that the savings may come at the cost of print quality, and some third-party inks could damage the hardware.\n\nWhile using third-party ink won't void the warranty, the printer manufacturer may not cover repairs or replacements if third-party supplies are found to be the source of damage. It's best to choose a reputable retailer or service known for high-quality third-party inks, and that will stand behind them."

            "content": "If you thought sponge colors were just for aesthetic appeal, you'd only be partly correct. The bright pink, yellow, blue and green hues they come in signal how and when to use them.\n\nUse the wrong sponge on the wrong surface, and you could end up with some hopelessly scratched appliances or damaged cookware. It took me 40 years to stumble upon this information, and it explains the unsightly scratches dotting my stovetop and fridge.\n\nThis guide is to help you avoid a similar fate.\n\nSponges are color-coded for reason. Robin Mosley/CNET\n\nLearning to decode these colors can also help prevent cross-contamination. Designating certain sponges for cleaning up bacterial messes, such as poultry spills, will keep that dangerous stuff from seeping into something untoward.\n\nHere's how to pick a sponge based on color and protect your fragile home appliances and kitchen surfaces.\n\nGreen\n\nIntended use: An all-purpose workhorse\n\nGreen sponges are tough and versatile -- too tough for stainless-steel appliances. Scotch-Brite\n\nThese scouring pads are the workhorse of the home cleaning world: multipurpose, dependable and ready to tackle just about anything.\n\nOften designated for general cleaning and dishwashing, they offer enough scrubbing power to remove midrange residue but can also handle tougher stains or even outdoor cleaning tasks. Basically, if you're not sure which sponge to grab, green means go.\n\nThey're too rough for glass, stainless steel and other sensitive surfaces, but for caked-on cast iron and a filthy fridge, nothing works quite as well.\n\nYellow:\n\nIntended use: Medium coarseness for sensitive surfaces\n\nYellow sponges are meant for more sensitive surfaces, including nonstick cookware. Mr. Scrub\n\nYellow sponges are right in the middle -- not too rough, not too soft but often overlooked. They represent a step down in abrasiveness from green. They are suitable for cleaning more delicate surfaces, such as glassware, countertops and kitchen sinks, which require careful treatment to avoid scratches but still develop significant stains and buildup.\n\nBlue\n\nIntended use: A softy for glass and stainless steel\n\nA blue sponge will coddle your most delicate wares. Lavex\n\nWhen you're dealing with delicate surfaces, reach for a blue sponge. It's the least abrasive option and is ideal for very delicate surfaces such as glass or stainless steel, where a scratch-free shine is the goal. Blue is basically the spa day of sponges -- gentle, calming and leaves everything looking refreshed.\n\nRed and pink\n\nIntended use: High-risk areas and bacterial messes\n\nReserve red sponges for bacterial mess. The Home Depot\n\nThese colors are typically reserved for the danger zones, such as cleaning tougher, baked-on food or areas that pose a higher bacterial risk, like the sink where you just rinsed raw chicken (you know, your kitchen's version of a crime scene).\n\nTheir color is less an indication of their coarseness than a visual reminder to never, ever use them on clean tableware, unless you enjoy living dangerously.\n\nAnd because they're often employed in hazardous jobs, you may want to stock up on a bundle and simply toss them more often than their counterparts in alternative colors.\n\nBlack:\n\nIntended use: Heavy-duty scrubbing\n\nJetz Scrubz\n\nThese highly abrasive, heavy-duty sponges are for serious scrubbing of stubborn, baked-on stains on tough surfaces. You might not go through them as often as the others, but for certain gnarly cleaning jobs, only the bristly black sponge will suffice.\n\nHow color-coding sponges reduces the risk of contamination\n\nUsing sponges strategically will reduce wear on kitchen surfaces. SimpleImages/Getty\n\nA systematic approach to kitchen hygiene often involves color-coding cleaning tools to ensure proper organization and cleanliness. This simple, visual system ensures a sponge used only for heavily soiled areas (or biohazard jobs) is never mistakenly used on clean glassware, silverware or plates. Because trust us, your guests will notice.\n\nBy establishing and following this clear color-coded system, you can reduce the spread of germs, keep your kitchen safer and ensure that your most delicate items are treated with the gentlest care. Plus, you'll finally have a legitimate reason to own a rainbow of colorful sponges.\n\nFor more cleaning tips, see a former custodian's tips for cleaning the bathroom like a pro and discover which all-purpose cleaner fared the best in our testing."

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nOne of the most significant improvements to TV picture quality has been the introduction of OLED technology. An OLED TV can create perfect black levels with infinite contrast, as well as excellent color and great motion control. It's a technology that lends itself well to sports, gaming on consoles or watching HDR TV shows and movies. I have tested the latest OLED TVs side-by-side in the CNET TV lab, including brands such as LG, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic. These are the models I recommend.\n\n\n\nThe best OLED TV\n\nThe best OLED TV for most users is the Samsung S90F TV as it's got both picture quality and affordability in equal measure, especially now that prices have come down. That said, the LG C5 is also an excellent TV at a similar price, and as a result you should buy whichever of the two models is cheapest at the time.\n\nIf you can spend more and want the best possible picture quality that you can get, then it's a choice between the LG G5 and the Samsung S95F. The LG TV is the most color accurate TV I tested in 2025 and the winner of a CNET Labs Award, while the Samsung is excellent in both the dark and in bright rooms.\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best OLED TV value of 2026 Samsung S90F 8.6 /10 SCORE It's a close call between the Samsung S90F and LG C5, as always at this level, but given the Samsung S90F is slightly better and around the same money it's the one to choose. The Samsung has similar picture quality to its more-expensive S95F sibling and that's the best reason to buy it. The Samsung also has most of the features you need including 4K/120Hz gaming support, HDR 10+ and onboard streaming. While the TV doesn't have Dolby Vision, the differences between HDR10+ and Dolby's HDR format are subtle at best. ...

Overhead lights and windows can wreak havoc on your picture, and it's not always feasible to close the curtains or turn the lights off. The Samsung S95F is the best TV I've seen to effectively ban reflections, and the fact that it gives excellent picture quality as well makes it the ultimate TV for the movies or gaming fan who likes to watch during the day. ...

It's neck-and-neck with the S95F for picture quality in terms of contrast and color, though the LG is demonstrably more accurate, with the best color accuracy score of the past year. Plus, the G5 is a blast to game on. I still like the S95F a little better, and that's mainly because of Samsung's reflection deterrence. ... Show more Get it now $1,877 at Amazon Learn more LG G5 review\n\nRecent updates Feb. 26, 2025: Added CNET Labs Award to LG G5 and updated pricing. Dec. 11, 2025: Added the Samsung S90F as the best value pick, and removed the 2024 LG C4. Oct. 2, 2025: Updated the list with new TVs including the Samsung S95F and the LG G5, plus added more information on my testing process.\n\nI also tested Panasonic Z95A: It boasts excellent picture quality, thanks to OLED, and it also includes a dedicated speaker system. It's being replaced by the Z95B but it's still available in some stores. Read my hands-on of the Panasonic Z95B. LG C5: While the LG G5 is a huge leap from the model that came before it, the C5 is more incremental. That said, it is still an improvement and if it's the same price as the C4 then get this instead. See my full review of the LG C5.\n\nFactors to consider when choosing an OLED TV Carly Marsh/CNET Screen size: OLEDs are available in sizes from 42 inches to 97 inches, and there are probably even bigger TVs coming in the future. One of the best pieces of advice I can give is, if you can afford it, always buy a TV one size bigger than you think you need. While 65 inches is the norm right now, TVs will keep getting bigger year after year, and you might consider buying a 77-inch to prevent an upgrade in the near future. However, if you're buying for a bedroom or a game room, then you could look at TVs 55 inches or less. Consider older models: At the affordable end of OLED, the yearly model updates aren't as dramatic when compared with the flagships. For TVs like the LG B5 or even C5, for instance, it makes sense to compare prices on last year's model and get whichever is cheapest. In the meantime, as we progress into the new year you're going to see the prices of 2025 models continue to drop. HDR formats: While it's not completely necessary, compatibility with Dolby Vision is a plus. Of course, Samsung doesn't support the Dolby format and instead offers its own version it calls HDR10 plus, and this is gaining in popularity. In the end, though, almost every 4K TV supports HDR 10, and this will work just fine. Gaming: If you're a gamer then having gaming-enhancing features is a bonus, and these includes a dedicated gaming mode (for turning off processing and reducing lag), 120Hz or higher support and even gaming apps such as Xbox Game Pass, Amazon Luna and Steam Link. Operating system: With the introduction of the Philips Roku TV, you have a choice of all of the best smart TV interfaces on OLED televisions. Whether it's Google TV, Fire TV or one of the manufacturer-specific systems, opting for a popular smart TV interface gives you the most choice with apps and on-demand content."

Some of the answers are long and difficult to unscramble, so if you need hints and answers, read on.\n\nI go into depth about the rules for Strands in this story.\n\nIf you're looking for today's Wordle, Connections and Mini Crossword answers, you can visit CNET's NYT puzzle hints page.\n\n\n\nHint for today's Strands puzzle\n\nToday's Strands theme is: It's a little much\n\n\n\nIf that doesn't help you, here's a clue: Whoa, that's plenty!\n\nClue words to unlock in-game hints\n\nYour goal is to find hidden words that fit the puzzle's theme. If you're stuck, find any words you can. Every time you find three words of four letters or more, Strands will reveal one of the theme words. These are the words I used to get those hints, but any words of four or more letters that you find will work:\n\nLURE, HARK, HARKEN, LATE, SORE, ROSE, TEAL, LATER, GLUE, GLUED, PLUS, LESS, GLARE\n\nAnswers for today's Strands puzzle\n\nThese are the answers that tie into the theme. The goal of the puzzle is to find them all, including the spangram, a theme word that reaches from one side of the puzzle to the other. When you have all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used. Here are the nonspangram answers:\n\nGLUT, EXCESS, SURPLUS, OVERKILL, REDUNDANCY\n\nToday's Strands spangram\n\nThe completed NYT Strands puzzle for Feb. 27, 2026.

To find it, start with the E that's four letters to the right on the top row, and wind down and around.\n\nQuick tips for Strands\n\n#1: To get more clue words, see if you can tweak the words you've already found, by adding an \"S\" or other variants. And if you find a word like WILL, see if other letters are close enough to help you make SILL, or BILL.\n\n#2: Once you get one theme word, look at the puzzle to see if you can spot other related words.\n\n#3: If you've been given the letters for a theme word, but can't figure it out, guess three more clue words, and the puzzle will light up each letter in order, revealing the word."
