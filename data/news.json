            "content": "IT should have been the biggest knees-up of Burnley’s Premier League lives – instead it became the day when VAR all but sealed their fate.\n\nThe Clarets had battled back from three down to snatch the unlikeliest of levellers in astonishing second half, only to blow it again.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then TWICE more Burnley put the ball in the net – and TWICE more the most controversial of calls from video official Paul Tierney robbed them.\n\nAnd there will be many who feel robbed is the right word, as both occasions were the most hairs-breadth calls against the home side.\n\nFirst when Jaidon Anthony strayed an inch beyond Michael Kayode before the cross that Zion Flemming headed in for another equaliser.\n\nAnd then, when Mikkel Damsgaard’s second looked to have saved the day, he was denied by an accidental handball before blasting it home.\n\nWhat a cruel end on what started as the most bland of days, because there was no hint of the mayhem to come in a first half so one-side plenty of home fans had already left by the time the teams were back in the dressing room.\n\nIn truth there wasn’t a hint of anything other than an away win – an away cakewalk in fact – from the second Brentford edged ahead after eight minutes.\n\nThat opener came when Mikkel Damsgaard – one of the smallest men on the pitch – was totally unmarked to meet Dango Outtara’s corner.\n\n\n\nKeeper Martin Dubravka claimed he was blocked, yet even without meeting traffic, he wouldn’t have got near the downward header.\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nThe Clarets’ pitiful defensive effort pretty much summed up the resistance Brentford faced in that opening 45-minute stroll – none.\n\n\n\nThere was certainly none when Damsgaard then turned provider to tee up the second for Igor Thiago with a bog-standard ball through the middle.\n\nThiago wasn’t about to pass up the chance and clipped a clinical effort past Dubravka for the second.\n\nIf that wasn’t game over, then it surely was on 35 minutes, when Kevin Schade blasted in number three and Burnley fans blasted the boss and owner.\n\nAnd once again it was hardly a goal of rocket science creation – more one of balls-up defending.\n\nThis time it was a Michael Kayode long throw-in that caused chaos, Sepp Van Den Berg rising highest to flick it goalwards.\n\n\n\nLucas Pires stretched out a leg to hook it away from the net, only for Schade to slam it home and home fans to slam manager Scott Parker and owner Alan Pace.\n\nBurnley were so bad that many couldn’t get to the exits quickly enough. Safe to say it wasn’t the wisest decision they will make this season.\n\nWhen they heard the cheers of a goal pulled back in first half stoppage time most will have seen it as little more than a consolation – and rightly so, you thought.\n\n\n\nThe Clarets didn’t even score it themselves either, in all fairness, because Jaidon Anthony’s far post strike was fizzing wide by some distance.\n\nYet Kayode, sliding back to try and block, had no chance to get out of the way and only managed to bundle it into his own net.\n\nUnfortunate, yes, but game-changing? Not even the most one-eyed of Clarets would have said so with anything more than blind faith at that stage.\n\nSo how unbelievable, incredible, astonishing and amazing that after an hour we were all square, first when Anthony did get his name on the scoresheet.\n\nStrictly speaking Kayode again had the final touch before the ball flew past Hakon Valdimarrson…yet he wasn’t about to claim a double.\n\n\n\nUnbelievably the impossible was on the cards. But this was Burnley…they just don’t come back from three goals down do they?\n\nWell actually, yes. Or at least they did here, because out of nowhere and all of a sudden it was 3-3 and Parker’s men were the ones pressing for a winner.\n\nBy now it was the Brentford backline which was in disarray, once again thanks to as Hannibal delivery – as it had been for the second.\n\nAs the Bees dithered, Zion Flemming darted and rose to plant his header into the corner from Mejbri’s pinpoint pass. Bedlam!\n\n\n\nMind you, nothing compared to the chaos that was just around the corner…you ain’t seen nothing yet, you could say.\n\nFor with 13 minutes to go Flemming was dancing a jig of delight in front of the barely believing fans at nodding in a potential winner.\n\nAnthony was fasted to reach Hannibal’s dinked free kick down the left and drilled over a low cross.\n\nKeane Lewis-Potter slid back to get something of a block on the ball, only for Flemming to bundle it home.\n\nDon’t celebrate too soon, though, eh? Not with VAR around to step in and call a gnat’s nudger of an offside against Anthony and wreck the party.\n\n\n\nEven so, a point was a fair return after that shocking first half…or at least it would have been. Damsgaard had other ideas.\n\nFor he had the final say on an astonishing afternoon by finding a pocket of space in the box to shoot past Dubravka for a fourth.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nStill there was time for Barnes to level it again – and then not, as it turned out.\n\nFootball, bloody hell, as someone once said."

It was the international break and we have four days off.\n\n“But nobody is allowed to go out of Europe, I think it was. You are not allowed to leave Europe.\n\n“I was listening in the dressing room – my wife was pregnant actually – Miami, LA and a few others are being mentioned and I am thinking ‘they can’t be going to do that, they are going to party all these lads’.\n\n\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\n“I am thinking I am going to go to Dubai.

We didn’t do anything’ – but he’s gone absolutely crazy. Two weeks wages, suspended and kicked me out of the club for a few days. Lost it completely.\n\n“All the lads have gone Miami, Vegas, everywhere and I am sitting there with a two week fine.\n\n“Big Chris Kirkland said ‘gaffer we need him back in the team and got me back in’.\n\n“But the fine, I had to actually pay the fine and never got it back from Steve Bruce.\n\n\n\n“And what he possibly doesn’t know is that others didn’t tell the truth and got away with it!”\n\nBrown’s version of events was put to his former boss Bruce who had some advice for his former player.\n\nHe said: “He should have kept his gob shut like the rest of them!”"

The Reds boosted their Champions League hopes while ensuring that Nuno Espirito Santo's side remain in the relegation zone.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nArne Slot described his side's first-half performance at Nottingham Forest last weekend as the 'worst we've played', but it was different story at Anfield. The Reds raced into a 1-0 lead through Hugo Ekitike.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVirgil van Dijk soon doubled Liverpool's advantage to continue his fine goalscoring form. West Ham were in the game, though, and had chances to get back in it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Irons' hopes looked to be dashed when Alexis Mac Allister made it 3-0 before half-time, only for Tomas Soucek to pull a goal back shortly after the break.

Liverpool's lightning-fast start\n\nAfter leaving it very late against Forest, Liverpool wasted no time to break the deadlock here. West Ham initially dealt with a corner in the fifth minute, only for Ryan Gravenberch to pick up the pieces on the edge of the penalty area.\n\nGravenberch whipped the ball into Ekitike, who found space and lashed a shot past Mads Hermansen courtesy of a deflection off Konstantinos Mavropanos.

With the interval approaching and West Ham still in with a chance of a making it a contest, Liverpool put the nail in their coffin.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMo Salah's delivery was inadvertently flicked to back post by Jarrod Bowen, allowing Ekitike to volley it back to Mac Allister in acres of space. The midfielder then produced a volley of his own, rifling it past Hermansen.\n\nIt was just the kind of first half Liverpool needed after Slot slated their opening 45 minutes at the City Ground.

But Gakpo, who'd missed a guilt-edged earlier in the second half, allayed the home crowd's fears with his first goal in eight league matches.\n\nEkitike provided the assist again, but it was the Netherlands international who did the hard work. Standing up Aaron Wan-Bissaka before cutting inside on his right foot, Gakpo ended his drought in style.\n\nStill West Ham didn't give up, though. Valentin Castellanos scored the sixth goal of the game and fourth from a corner to restore the two-goal deficit. But it was too little, too late, as Axel Disasi's own goal made it 5-2.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Cody Gakpo made it 4-1 with a well-taken goal (Image: Liverpool FC/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)\n\n5.

With the two teams directly above them - Tottenham and Forest - having employed managers, West Ham supporters will be worrying about that gap getting larger on Sunday.\n\nAlthough Santo's side were by no means hammered by Liverpool, they paid the price for poor defending.

The new extended format, which was implemented two years ago, fails to prevent teams who faced off in the initial league phase meeting in the first knockout round.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat means City and Real will meet again just a little over two months since Guardiola's team were victorious at the Bernabeu.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd the former Barcelona head coach has suggested that the competition should tweak the rules to ensure teams who meet in the league phase are kept apart in the last 16.\n\nVAR gets EVEN MORE power as football lawmakers make controversial rule changes READ MORE :\n\n“Yes, it is a little bit weird [to face Real Madrid again],” he said. “Not many times does it happen that the last game of the group stage — Real Madrid v Benfica — is the first draw. It looks different. People will agree or disagree, but it is different.”\n\nWhen he was asked if UEFA should change the rules, Guardiola replied: “Why not? How many times have we played against ­Newcastle this season [the Premier League clubs meet in the FA Cup next weekend, having already contested a two-legged Carabao Cup semi- final]? Hopefully we can play against them in the [Champions League] final!\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Today is different.

So I’m not a fan of that [saying it’s the easier half of the draw].\n\n“The Champions League is so ­difficult. I’m not saying Madrid is not difficult, everybody knows it, but the rest of the teams that you play, I don’t know, you can name me any team, all of them, they have the 'trick'.

The International Football Association Board (IFAB) have gone all-in on the video assistant referee, despite continued flashpoints and complaints.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUsing VAR to check corners will be an option for competitions from this summer, while the core VAR protocol has now been widened to cover second yellow cards and cards awarded to the wrong team.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIFAB have also approved a package of measures to counter tactics designed to disrupt the tempo of matches which come into effect this summer. The successful introduction of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers has encouraged IFAB to go further on efforts to stop players slowing the game.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReferees will be given the power to start a five-second countdown if they feel players are taking too long over throw-ins and dead-ball goal kicks, and substitutions must be completed in no more than 10 seconds, otherwise the substitute must stay off for at least one minute.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\nThe IFAB also decided at its annual general meeting in Wales on Saturday to enforce a period of at least one minute off the field for any player whose injury forces a stoppage in play.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Premier League has been trialling a 30-second period, but some within the IFAB did not feel this was long enough to serve as a deterrent. Other competitions had tested longer periods, with two minutes trialled at last year’s Arab Cup.\n\nThe aim with all the measures set to be adopted is to maintain the tempo of the game but also to help reduce time to be added on for stoppages, which is a problem from a player welfare perspective, for supporters and for broadcasters’ schedules.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

IFAB also agreed trials be conducted to further assess goalkeeper tactical injury delays and to propose options to deter this behaviour.\n\nLawmakers are adamant VAR checks on corners must not delay the kick being taken and will only be used to spot obvious errors. Corner-kick checks will be an option, rather than a mandatory part of the VAR protocol.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVARs will also only check incorrectly-awarded second yellow cards. They will not advise referees to issue a second yellow card where one was not shown on the field.\n\nThe IFAB will also hold consultations to develop measures where players leave the field of play as an act of protest against a referee’s decision or team officials instigating such action and where players cover their mouth when confronting opponents during matches.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations final was delayed by a walk-off by Senegal, while Benfica midfielder Gianluca Prestianni is alleged to have racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior during a Champions League match last week while his mouth was covered by his shirt.

The talented playmaker headed to west London with a hatful of accolades. During his time in Italy, Gullit won three Serie A titles and two European Cups, amongst other silverware.\n\nBefore to his trophy haul in Italy, Gullit claimed three Dutch league titles during his spells at Feyenoord and PSV Eindhoven. He also won the European Championships with the Netherlands in 1988.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC in 2020, Gullit said that Stamford Bridge was a slice of nirvana for him, insisting that he was bewitched by London's charm.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Glenn Hoddle welcomes Ruud Gullit to Chelsea in June 1995. (Image: Steve Munday/ALLSPORT)\n\nHe said: \"I'm still sad about the way it ended, but my time at Chelsea will always be my happy time. It was paradise for me. I fell in love with London straight away because I found a kind of freedom that is priceless. It was my happy place.\"\n\nExplaining how English football was a culture shock for him, Gullit elaborated on his decision to join Chelsea because Glenn Hoddle was the manager at the time. He revealed that Stamford Bridge also shocked him due to its primitive state in its old guise.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I was 32, nearly 33, I had been at the top for a long time and had won a lot too,\" Gullit said. \"Some people probably thought my legs had gone and I was coming here for the ride - to take the money and just get ready to retire. They were wrong.\n\n\"Nobody I spoke to that summer understood why I chose Chelsea. I must say I didn't know much about the club or even that part of town when I went there - it was just because Glenn Hoddle was manager, that's what persuaded me to go.\n\n\"When I came for the first time to see Stamford Bridge, I was like 'what the hell kind of stadium is this?' I was used to playing in the best stadiums in the world, but here there were only two stands. The place wasn't just a building site; it was a total wreck. You had to walk around on planks of wood.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea new signing Gianfranco Zola meets the press with manager Ruud Gullit (Image: Ben Radford/Allsport)\n\n\"But I loved it. It was almost like I was going back to when I had just started playing, when I was nine years old. It was fantastic.\"\n\nChoosing Chelsea years after he snubbed Arsenal, Gullit was careful to add that the Blues were still a project that had to be sold to him.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe explained: \"Glenn [Hoddle] had to sell Chelsea and their ambition to me - he said they were at the start of a journey too - but what was most important was that it was Glenn. In the eyes of the Dutch, he was the best English footballer ever.\"\n\nDiscussing the differences between Italian and English football in the 1990s, he said: \"There was another way English football was different from Italy, and in a good way - the crowd, and the attitude in the stands.\n\n\"I felt a different bond with them, and not just the Chelsea supporters. In the Premier League, the fans appreciated what you were doing more - if you did something special on the pitch that they loved, people went crazy. I hit it off with the Chelsea fans straight away.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Their supporters were fantastic, always, even when I left, and they still are now. I loved it. I loved the way they were with me and I will always treasure that.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Hoddle left Chelsea to take the reins as England boss. Gullit was appointed as a player-manager, subsequently becoming the first Dutch manager in the Premier League.\n\nView 4 Images Ruud Gullit in action for Chelsea (Image: Gary M. Prior/ALLSPORT)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe led the club to the FA Cup, their first trophy in 26 years. He also finished a credible sixth with the Blues but was sacked in his second season, despite being second in the league at the time, reportedly due to a disagreement with the board.\n\n\"I signed Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli, Roberto di Matteo and Frank Leboeuf. We won the FA Cup in 1997 and, in February 1998 we were second in the Premier League, in the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup,\" Gullit said of his time as manager.\n\n\"Being sacked was a horrible experience, and there was no reason to do what they did. They made out it was over my contract demands but that was rubbish because there had not been any negotiations.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR CHELSEA FB PAGE! Latest Blues news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nUltimately, Gullit has a positive outlook on his time with Chelsea and in England. So much was his affection for these shores that he took up a job with Newcastle United in 1998 but only lasted just over a season at St James' Park.\n\n\"I felt that living in England enriched my experiences in life, and enhanced my ideas about football. I still feel the same way,\" Gullit said.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"I am very proud I was there at the start for Chelsea, and to see what the Premier League has become too. Both have moved on so much, they are unrecognisable. But they had to start somewhere.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

At the other end, Toyosi Olusanya was a handful for the Hearts backline and provided a good outball for the visitors.\n\nPierre Landry Kabore should have had the home side in front after 21 minutes, however, after latching on to a ball over the top but he could not direct his lob over the onrushing Mitov on target.\n\nImage: Hearts' Pierre Landry Kabore and Aberdeen's Gavin Molloy in action\n\nOlusanya could have edged the visitors in front shortly after when he got on the end of Topi Keskinen's low cross into the box but he fired his first-time effort well over.\n\nHearts did take the lead just before the half-hour mark, however, with Kabore doing really well to muscle his way down the right-hand side, avoiding the sliding challenge of Liam Morrison, before calmly picking out Braga who slotted his effort into the net from 10 yards.\n\nThe hosts were in no mood to hang around after the break with Kabore stinging the palms of Mitov before the goalkeeper was on hand to deny Braga at the back post after the Portuguese connected with Kabore's flick on.\n\nImage: Hearts Claudio Braga celebrates scoring to make it 1-0 against Aberdeen\n\nThe visitors struggled to carve out clear goalscoring opportunities in a stuffy second half, Kevin Nesbit's wayward first-time volley the best they could muster as they ended the game having failed to have a shot on target.\n\nAberdeen did try to force Hearts back in the closing stages as they sought an equaliser but the hosts were never really in any danger as they held on for a vital three points.\n\nWhat's coming up in the Scottish Premiership?"

Other competitions had tested longer periods, with two minutes trialled at last year's Arab Cup.\n\nThe aim with all the measures set to be adopted is to maintain the tempo of the game but also to help reduce time to be added on for stoppages, which is a problem from a player welfare perspective, for supporters and for broadcasters' schedules.\n\nChanges agreed on Saturday will officially become part of the laws of the game from July 1 but will be adopted at this summer's World Cup which kicks off on June 11.\n\nThe IFAB also agreed trials be conducted to further assess goalkeeper tactical injury delays and to propose options to deter this behaviour.\n\nLawmakers are adamant VAR checks on corners must not delay the kick being taken and will only be used to spot obvious errors. Corner-kick checks will be an option, rather than a mandatory part of the VAR protocol.\n\nVARs will also only check incorrectly-awarded second yellow cards. They will not advise referees to issue a second yellow card where one was not shown on the field.\n\nThe IFAB will also hold consultations to develop measures where players leave the field of play as an act of protest against a referee's decision or team officials instigating such action and where players cover their mouth when confronting opponents during matches.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations final was delayed by a walk-off by Senegal, while Benfica midfielder Gianluca Prestianni is alleged to have racially abused Real Madrid winger Vinicius Junior during a Champions League match last week while his mouth was covered by his shirt.\n\nUEFA is investigating the incident and Prestianni denies racially abusing Vinicius."

            "content": "\"Watch yourself now. Enjoy it but you're going to get a lot of media attention; everyone's going to know you. You've gone from no one knowing who you are to a potential superstar...\"\n\nThose were the words Michael Carrick gave Marcus Rashford 10 years ago after his dream start to life at Manchester United.\n\nIn two matches three days apart, a slight, fresh-faced 18-year-old from Wythenshawe saw his life change forever, with four goals that propelled a career into the blinding glare of hopeful superstardom.\n\nThere are fairytales and then there's the story of Rashford's debut. Everything fell into place, the sliding doors moved seamlessly to allow for a career worth over 400 senior United appearances, 68 England caps, along with more than 150 goals for both club and country.\n\nStarting with that Europa League night against Midtjylland before a Premier League classic against Arsenal, Rashford not only lived the dream but became the dream.\n\nRooney out, Martial injured... What next?\n\nThe lore is well-worn. United were in the midst of an injury crisis in forward areas ahead of a crunch round of 32 tie against Midtjylland.\n\nHaving been embarrassed in Denmark, United had to save face at Old Trafford but captain Wayne Rooney was out with an injury. Anthony Martial was next to fall injured, this time minutes before kick off. Then-boss Louis van Gaal had a decision to make with little time to think - but for the Dutch manager it wasn't a difficult one.\n\nImage: Frans Hoek alongside Rashford after his debut against Midtjylland\n\n\"We came back into the locker room, and the assistants were coming up with all kinds of solutions, except for Marcus,\" Frans Hoek, a key part of Van Gaal's coaching staff at the time, reveals to Sky Sports.\n\n\"They were saying, 'Okay, if we do this, then this player can be there and blah blah blah.' The normal discussions that you have when something happens like that.\n\n\"And then, when everybody had said what they had to say, Louis said, 'We don't change anything. Marcus goes in. Marcus deserves it. Marcus is doing a good job. He is improving. He is young and I believe in that.' That was the moment.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Louis van Gaal says Marcus Rashford produced 'a great performance' after scoring twice on his Manchester United debut against FC Midtjylland\n\nVan Gaal was resting his hopes on someone whose only experience in the first team up to that point was a bench appearance at Watford a few months prior.\n\n\"All credit to Louis because he was never afraid to put young players in,\" Hoek adds.\n\n\"He did the same at Ajax, at Barcelona, at Bayern Munich and with the national team. For him, if they are good enough, then they are old enough. It is simple.\n\n\"And he definitely was not afraid to replace people who had certain reputations if he felt it was the best for the team.\n\n\"A coach like Louis does not get influenced. He just has his eyes and his way of thinking. He put in Andres Iniesta, he put in Xavi. He put in so many of them.\n\n\"If you are objective as a coach and not influenced by everything that happens around football, I think you make these kinds of decisions faster.\"\n\n'In the academy, Rashford could do anything he wanted with a football'\n\nFrom the outside, it was a surprise. 'Who on earth is this kid?' Those in the stands uttered amid the late change. But for those closer to Rashford, through his time in the academy, could tell he had been marked early on to impact the first team.\n\nImage: James Weir made his Manchester United debut against Arsenal after Rashford's Premier League debut double\n\n\"He was the guy!\" James Weir, who played with Rashford in the United Academy.\n\n\"He was two years younger and I knew his name, whereas I couldn't name any other person in his age group.\n\n\"I think they can tell technically, and they know when they're going to fill out. He had two older brothers who were quite big as well and tall. So, they probably expected him to grow and fill into his body.\n\n\"But technically, he was pretty superior. The first time I played with him was probably in one of the reserve games, like under-21s or 23s and he was, jumping ahead of people a couple of years above him, just because he was that good.\n\n\"He was always. I remember, even in digs, we'd be playing football with a balloon, and he'd be doing, around the worlds. It's actually harder to do it with a balloon than it is with a normal football.\n\n\"He could do anything he wanted with a football, even doing keepy-ups with a tennis ball. Most people are lucky to do four or five; he's consistently doing it.\"\n\nRecollections of Rashford's first training session with the first team have lived with former team-mate and current Melbourne Victory midfielder, Juan Mata for the past decade.\n\nImage: Rashford in training alongside Juan Mata\n\n\"I have a vivid memory of that day, he was playing on the right wing,\" Mata says.\n\n\"He was quite thin and quick. He was quite shy off the pitch but he was brave on the pitch, and that was nice to see. You could see he was already taking people one against one, going behind. Very quick, very speedy.\n\n\"At the end of the session, I was talking with Ander Herrera and he was telling me, 'did you see this kid? I think he's going to be a great player'.\n\n\"Ander really saw it since the beginning and I remember he told me that day, he's going to bring us a lot and I said, 'Well, wait, it's too early, he only trained with us once'... Ander was not wrong.\"\n\nImage: Man Utd's starting lineup on Rashford's debut\n\nMata set up Rashford's first-ever professional goal, opening the floodgates.\n\n\"You could see how happy he was, his family in the stands, it meant a lot for him,\" Mata recalls.\n\n\"So it was the start of something really nice for him and a very nice start to a good week. I still remember celebrating with him and seeing how this kid from Manchester was fulfilling his dream and it was very nice to see how happy he was and how much he deserved it.\"\n\nThe Arsenal game that followed United's 5-1 win over Midtjylland and it was a special day for the United Academy.\n\nAlongside Rashford's Premier League debut, Timothy Fosu-Mensah earned his first stripes and so did Weir as United beat the Gunners 3-2 at Old Trafford.\n\nWeir recalls LVG dive - 'I thought Wenger had hit him!' Man Utd's win over Arsenal at Old Trafford is also remembered for a bizarre moment from Louis van Gaal on the touchline. The Dutch coach mimicked what he thought was a dive from Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez after a challenge from Herrera. Weir watched on while warming up: \"I just saw all the fans do something, like all this commotion, and then I saw LVG on the floor, so I honestly thought Wenger had hit him. I thought Wenger had dropped him.\"\n\nImage: Louis van Gaal mimics Alexis Sanchez from the touchline\n\nReplacing Herrera in injury time meant that Weir watched from the dugout as Rashford continued to do the remarkable, playing a part in all three goals.\n\n\"I remember when he banged that first goal in, like, you're not surprised, because he has that, you've seen it in training, you've seen it in the academy, you've seen it in the reserves, he's got the quality. I've seen it in the back garden!\n\n\"I remember him being buzzing and obviously, everyone around the club was buzzing for him, because that's what it's about, getting youth team players into the first team.\"\n\n'He was a kid and a man who gave everything to Man Utd' - Mata\n\nRashford didn't slow down from then on. He went on to play an instrumental role as United won the FA Cup that season.\n\nEngland and Roy Hodgson couldn't ignore the prodigy either, as his first call-up and debut goal came three months later. Rashford then earned a spot in the Three Lions squad for the 2016 Euros, where he would make two appearances.\n\nImage: Rashford made his England debut in May 2016\n\nNow, after a difficult spell, before back-to-back loans at Aston Villa and now at Barcelona, Rashford's time at Old Trafford looks to be moving towards a permanent end, with a divorce seemingly the best option for both parties. But there's a consensus that he wrote a beautiful story at United.\n\n\"It's not easy to handle with all the expectations and the pressure at the club like Man Utd but I think people will realise that he was a kid and he was a man who gave everything for the club he supported since he was a kid,\" Mata says.\n\n\"You can see photos of him when he was almost a baby with a Man Utd shirt on. So it meant a lot for him to play for Man Utd. You could see that. I think he gave great moments and great memories for many fans. Of course, there were also some challenging times but I think they made him more mature and a stronger man.\n\n\"Nobody has an easy career. It doesn't matter how successful you have been. There are always challenges and he had that at the club. But he's now in a new chapter. He went to Barcelona, which is one of the best teams in the world and he's performing there. He's showing his level. I'm very happy for him that he's able to try and prove his level in different countries.\"\n\nImage: Rashford smiles during a Barcelona training session at the Nou Camp\n\nHoek, who also has a storied coaching history with Barcelona, shares Mata's sentiment. Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona.\n\n\"Rashford was an easy guy to work with,\" Hoek says.\n\n\"Hardworking and not complaining. Of course, when they start their career, it is different but I have followed his career from United to Barcelona and he is doing some great things there.\n\n\"I think that he has lived up to the expectations that were there at Barcelona. I think it is a fantastic experience for him in that league, away from United, away from the Premier League. I think it has only been very positive for him.\"\n\nImage: Rashford has scored 10 goals and assisted 13 in 34 games at Barcelona\n\nWeir, though, still has hopes that the Rashford story at United has not yet seen its conclusion.\n\n\"I'd love him to win LaLiga this year, the Champions League,\" Weir says\n\n\"Go and do that, and then he's done it. But I'd love him to come back to United.\n\n\"I think he'd look back in when he's 40 and think, I left the chapter of my career there. He is some player. Hopefully, he gets to the World Cup and does well there. Then if United do get Champions League, it's made for him.\n\n\"I think it depends a lot on the manager who comes in at United, but obviously, the club is growing now, for sure, and he's a fantastic player, so he'd definitely add something to that Man United squad.\"\n\nThe beginning was picture-book, a true video-game-like storyline to becoming a superstar. The future of Rashford's career may be uncertain but there will be no forgetting the fresh-faced 18-year-old from Wythenshawe who lived and became the dream."

            "content": "Football’s lawmaking authority, the Ifab, is to conduct a two-year review of the video assistant referee to ensure the technology is being used “to its best”. The announcement on Saturday came alongside a flurry of enhancements to the rulebook before the World Cup, including expanding the use of VAR into determining corner kicks.\n\nAnother proposal could mean punishments for players obscuring their mouths being fast-tracked for implementation at this summer’s tournament, after the alleged racist abuse of Vinícius Júnior by Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni.\n\nThe VAR review was confirmed by the technical director of Ifab, David Elleray, on the 10th anniversary of the decision to first trial video technology. “We have agreed today that after 10 years we should be reviewing VAR to see where we want to go with it in the future,” Elleray said.\n\n“There is a very interesting debate over what direction VAR should go in because within football there are two contrasting philosophies: some that want as far as possible perfect decision making … and those who say we have to accept that refereeing errors are part of the game.”\n\nBefore the outcome of any review, Ifab confirmed that VAR’s powers are to be extended into three new areas. The first will give official permission to check and review any red card decision that comes from a “clearly incorrect second yellow card”. Second, they will be able to intervene when the referee punishes the wrong team for an offence.\n\nFinally VAR will be able to review a “clearly incorrectly awarded corner kick”, albeit only under the condition that the review “can be completed immediately and without delaying the restart”.\n\nView image in fullscreen VAR will now be able to review a ‘clearly incorrectly awarded corner kick’. Photograph: Sebastian Frej/Getty Images\n\nAll of these developments are to be in place by June and it is expected that Ifab will confirm new disciplinary measures related to discriminatory behaviour too. There is to be a fast-tracked consultation over incidents where players “cover their mouth when confronting opponents during matches” or “unilaterally the field of play as an act of protest” as in the case of the Senegal national side during this year’s Afcon final. Both actions are likely to be punished with a yellow card.\n\nThe first “semi-live” trial of VAR was conducted in 2016 during a men’s international friendly between France and Italy. A decade later video technology is now embedded in the top echelons of the game but has driven widespread dissatisfaction due to delays in decision making and matches being determined by marginal outcomes.\n\nThe English FA’s chief executive, Mark Bullingham, said it was key that rulemakers continued to innovate in their application of VAR. “There is a review going on looking at how we use VAR to its best,” he said. “If you look at the innovations that Fifa have brought through, particularly in semi-autonomous offside, I think they’re fantastic.\n\n“The speed with which decisions are made, and the accuracy, takes a big amount of frustration away from fans. The other interesting area is looking at what can we learn from other trials being done? The Football Video Support system gives the coach a challenge system. Are there elements of that we should consider adopting for the future? Because that reduces the amount of times when there is a VAR intervention and effectively puts the emphasis on the coach.”\n\nAt the AGM in his role as chair of the Fifa referee’s committee, Pierluigi Collina encapsulated the first decade of VAR with a metaphor. “In Italy we are used to saying that, in every wonderful marriage, there is a crisis after seven years,” he said. “So it might be possible that people fell in love with the VAR and then after some years, as with your wife, you have a small crisis.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fifa referee’s committee, Pierluigi Collina, spoke at the AGM. Photograph: David Davies/PA\n\nIn addition to the extension of VAR protocols, the Ifab brought in new measures to tackle time-wasting and the disruption of tempo in matches. The successful introduction of the eight-second rule for goalkeepers has encouraged Ifab to go further on efforts to stop players slowing the game.\n\nReferees will be given the power to start a five-second countdown if they feel players are taking too long over throw-ins and dead-ball goal kicks, with the throw-in reversed or a corner kick the sanction for delaying. Substitutions must be completed in no more than 10 seconds, otherwise the substitute must stay off for at least one minute."

            "content": "For those Sunderland fans making the 700-mile round trip from Wearside, some beginning their journey at midnight, they arrived to the welcome sight of Granit Xhaka’s first start since 17 January. Could the captain’s return inspire Sunderland from the slump that began in mid-December? On the south coast, a losing run came to its end. Régis Le Bris’s team claimed the point their determined performance deserved.\n\n“To have a natural leader like that come into the team is great,” said the Sunderland defender Dan Ballard. “We’ve missed him.” Patrolling in front of defence, Xhaka maintained constant dialogue with his colleagues, encouraging, directing into position, veering into the territory of player-manager. “After three defeats it’s not easy to react and for a newly promoted side, confidence is always a topic,” said Le Bris. “I am happy with the team spirit.”\n\nWhen Eliezer Mayenda scored Sunderland’s goal, Xhaka clenched his fists in triumph, celebrating first with Le Bris. For Bournemouth, for whom a draw dents outside hopes of European football next season, a wholly preventable goal. Habib Diarra had been shown inside from Ballard’s pass. Their goalkeeper, Djordje Petrovic, could only direct Diarra’s shot into Mayenda’s path.\n\nBournemouth have not lost since 3 January but struggle to kill off their opponents; this was a 12th draw of the season. The goalless draw at West Ham had forced a rethink, Evanilson benched. “I was looking to match their midfield because they have very good players in the middle,” explained Andoni Iraola. That plan was torn up at half-time, the Brazilian scored the equaliser, Iraola’s in-game management coming up trumps. “We know the first half wasn’t ourselves,” said Bournemouth’s Marcus Tavernier. “In the second half we knew we needed a reaction.”\n\nSunderland did not start like a team in the doldrums. Noah Sadiki’s shot forced an early save from Petrovic and when Enzo Le Fée was floored by Álex Jiménez, a penalty looked like a credible claim. And yet Jarred Gillett, the referee, waved that away, his judgment of “normal contact” backed by video assistance, to the incredulity of Le Fée who said ruefully: “We can’t change the decision now.” Iraola’s view: “It would have been a soft one.”\n\nWearside muscle took a stronghold in those early stages, their twin towers, Ballard and Omar Alderete, overpowered Eli Junior Kroupi while Trai Hume did a decent job of keeping Rayan quiet until the game’s dying embers.\n\nView image in fullscreen Eliezer Mayenda gives Sunderland the lead. Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nAnother goalkeeping error almost let Bournemouth back in, only for Robin Roefs to recover after he had dropped a Tavernier shot. Roefs got luckier yet when, out of his penalty area, he lost possession and collided with Kroupi. That decision went Sunderland’s way, to audible disgust from Iraola, wanting a straight red, though he afterwards said Gillett should have let play go on, which would probably have resulted in a goal. Roefs, otherwise excellent, would have been a profound loss.\n\nXhaka was at the centre of a second-half flashpoint when he and Tyler Adams crunched together, the American clattering his opponent’s ankle. “Really dangerous,” said Le Bris. Adams escaped a red on the video verdict, though was quickly removed by Iraola as a sending off waiting to happen. To compound the confusion, Gillett had also awarded a Bournemouth free-kick. On came Ryan Christie, his first touch supplying Tavernier for a cross that evaded Sunderland’s defenders, the ball knocked in by Evanilson’s shoulder. “The gaffer pointed out that we had to put in balls early,” said Tavernier.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evanilson shoulders the ball home after a great cross from Marcus Tavernier. Photograph: Ian Walton/Reuters\n\nRoefs’ booking for time-wasting marked the shift in momentum towards Bournemouth. Xhaka’s departure in the 76th minute left his teammates to see out a result, part of the plan according to his manager. “At the end our togetherness was strong,” said Le Bris. Without Xhaka, Sunderland had the ball in the net but when Ballard bundled home Lutsharel Geertruida had strayed offside.\n\nThe chase for a winner became frantic, fiery when Christie and Le Fée went up in each other’s grill while both sets of fans were united in railing at Gillett. Rayan at last found space in fully 12 minutes of time added on and a rasping shot from the flank deflecting off Alderete and behind had the home support gasping in expectation for a goal that never arrived."

            "content": "Norwich condemned relegation-threatened Leicester to a fourth successive home Championship defeat to end Gary Rowett’s unbeaten start as manager.\n\nThe second-half substitute Anis Ben Slimane drilled Norwich ahead just six minutes after coming off the bench at the King Power Stadium before Ali Ahmed’s close-range finish sealed a seventh win in nine league games.\n\nThe result extended Leicester’s winless league run to nine matches and kept them third-bottom but further strengthened Norwich’s bid for survival as Philippe Clement’s in-form side climbed 11 points clear of the drop zone.\n\nRowett had seen his side claim creditable away draws in his first two games since taking charge and they started brightly enough, with Ricardo Pereira almost sending Bobby De Cordova-Reid clear, only for his through-ball to hit the midfielder’s heel.\n\nWith former head coach Enzo Maresca watching from the stands, Leicester’s final ball lacked quality and composure, summed up when Harry Winks overhit a diagonal pass, aimed for Luke Thomas, straight out of play.\n\nSlimane came on for the dangerous Paris Maghoma just after the hour and within minutes forced a brilliant save from Jakub Stolarczyk after Ben Chrisene’s cross had deflected into his path.\n\nBut there was nothing the Leicester goalkeeper could do to stop his next effort as Slimane combined with Sam Field on the edge of the area and drilled a fine shot into the bottom left-hand corner after 68 minutes.\n\nThe goal extended Leicester’s run without a clean sheet to 29 games and worse was to follow nine minutes later. Kellen Fisher was allowed time and space from a set piece by a dozing defence to advance and cross, with Stolarczyk deflecting Errol Mundle-Smith’s shot across goal to the back post where an unmarked Ahmed poked home.\n\nMatt Crooks’ smash-and-grab goal secured Hull a 1-0 victory at Portsmouth to match a 60-year record. The Tigers only had two shots but made them count as Crooks capitalised on a defensive mix-up to make it five away wins in a row; the last time Hull had won as many on the road was 1966.\n\nIt also made sure they kept the pressure on the top two in the automatic promotion race, while Pompey lost back-to-back home matches for just the third time since their return to the second tier.\n\nThe Tigers came out of the traps quickly and should have opened the scoring after 44 seconds. Lewis Koumas got down the left side and sent a low ball in the box for Joe Gelhardt, but he fired straight at Nicolas Schmid. Oli McBurnie headed the rebound home but was flagged offside.\n\nFrom then on in the first half, Pompey had 69% of the possession and all 14 of the other shots in the half. Then, out of nowhere in the second half, the Tigers took the lead, as Crooks was gifted a tap-in after a double Adrian Segecic error.\n\nThe Australian’s miscontrol put him in danger before a short backpass allowed McBurnie to close down keeper Schmid and the ball popped up for Crooks to lash home for his fourth goal of the season.\n\nView image in fullscreen Derby’s Ben Brereton Díaz wheels away after scoring his side’s first goal against Blackburn. Photograph: Nigel French/PA\n\nDerby revived their playoff challenge with an impressive second-half comeback to beat Blackburn 3-1 at Pride Park. The visitors led through Hayden Carter’s header but Ben Brereton Díaz struck against his former club to turn the game in Derby’s favour.\n\nMatt Clarke punished tentative defending before the impressive Derry Murkin claimed his second assist to provide Rhian Brewster with the goal to seal victory and leave Rovers in relegation trouble.\n\nOn Friday, Jeremy Ngakia’s 77th-minute strike secured a 2-1 win for Watford over Bristol City at Ashton Gate. The visitors took a seventh-minute lead when Luca Kjerrumgaard fired home from six yards. But the home side were level in the 36th minute when Scott Twine powered a close-range header past Egil Selvik.\n\nA draw looked the likely outcome, but Ngakia found the top corner with a sweetly struck right-foot shot from 25 yards out."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his Tottenham players are not fit enough and has questioned their desire to put in the hard yards without the ball.\n\nThe interim head coach has a clearer idea of the problems he faces after two weeks – and there are many of them, including low levels of confidence and the capacity of the younger players to handle the pressure of a relegation battle.\n\nTudor knows there are reasons for the physical issues with the squad stretched by an injury crisis amid a punishing schedule. Although Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso are in contention to return for Sunday’s trip to Fulham, Tottenham will be without eight injured players plus the suspended Cristian Romero.\n\nTudor believes there is only one way out of the situation – an on-the-hoof fitness reboot in training, particularly as the club had no midweek fixture last week or this. The Croat surprised the players by working them extremely hard throughout last week and not tapering off before last Sunday’s home game against Arsenal, which they lost 4-1. As Tudor made plain, it is not a time to pander to player sensibilities.\n\n“Physically, we are not in an amazing situation,” Tudor said. “They have played lots of games in the last period without lots of players available and it made the physical condition of the team drop down. So we need to use this period where we don’t play the games to put some petrol in the engine so the engine starts to work better.\n\n“They are fatigued. To do the pressing high you need to be fit. But [it is] all of them because if someone is not in the right shape there is a problem because someone is coming late [to the press].\n\n“The second thing is that there is the other goal to protect. It is easy to run there but you need to run back. If you run up and don’t run back it’s a problem. For sure, we will improve and do these things better over time but in this moment it’s a big question what we can do and what we cannot do.”\n\nTudor was asked about his full-throttle approach from the first training session. “Yes, that’s the only way – running,” he said. “The pitch is 100 yards, it’s long. So you need to run.\n\n“Maybe you have habits to, I don’t know … work a bit less. I put some runs without the ball [into the sessions]. Never players like runs without the ball so we put some runs without balls. But it’s a moment when there is no time to think too much about what somebody doesn’t like. And the best thing is that they understand this. They gave me their availability to do these things.”\n\nTudor is under no illusions about the size of the challenge. It was put to him that the striker, Randal Kolo Muani, had played well against Arsenal. “That’s good, one good thing,” he replied.\n\nWhat Tudor wants to see at Fulham and beyond is players such as Kolo Muani stepping up, accepting the responsibility. “Some players are still young,” he said. “They were brought here to help and now maybe they are in a moment where they need to resolve the problems.\n\nView image in fullscreen Randal Kolo Muani scores against Arsenal – Igor Tudor wants him to keep raising his game for Spurs. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\n“If you have too many of these players because of the amount of injuries, who are playing together in the squad, it does create some problems. But it is also an opportunity and a challenge to grow fast, to become a man. To say: ‘Come on, I’m the guy, give me the ball, I will score.’ Instead of just: ‘What can I do? I’m just here, you know.’\n\n“It’s always how you see the situation. It’s not: ‘I’m just here. We had 15 players and I was always left out and now we have 10 players out, so I play.’ How do you really see that situation? If you are the right guy and positive, there is opportunity.”\n\nTudor has not dwelt for long on the derby with Arsenal. “No, no, forget that,” he said. It was never likely to be a game that would define the club’s survival hopes. The same is not true of Fulham – or the home fixture against Crystal Palace next Thursday.\n\n“After the first game, I said if you play against the best team in the world at this moment, it’s not a realistic game to show [whether] we are soldiers or we are not soldiers,” Tudor said. “That’s the truth. They show they can be in some parts of the game. But for long periods we had problems, in defence especially. It’s not easy against them. Let’s see in the next games.”"

            "content": "Arsenal had to expect the jibes from Tottenham and they were not disappointed. Just before kick-off in last Sunday’s north London derby, the Spurs support in the South Stand of their stadium spelled out a giant message in mosaic form. “North Ldn since 1882,” it read.\n\nA clear dig, then, at Arsenal’s south of the river history from the Woolwich days and, as mentioned, very much a part of a rivalry where goading and baiting go hand in hand with the loathing. Arsenal had been similarly provocative before the derby against Spurs at the Emirates Stadium last November, lighting the pre-match scene with a tifo featuring images of various club greats. The most prominent at the top of it? Sol Campbell, of course.\n\nWhat was more surprising – and certainly led to raised eyebrows at Arsenal – was Wolves’ now infamous TikTok post on the Thursday before last. The 80-second clip, uploaded after the 2-2 draw between the clubs the previous night, was a savage take on Arsenal’s “game management”. Or, to put it another way, and as Wolves surely intended, their dark arts and shithousery.\n\nThe social media team at Wolves showed how Gabriel Martinelli taunted the home crowd by flashing up the scoreline on his fingers as Arsenal led 2-1. They highlighted the delay in Arsenal taking a corner as they continued to lead. They mocked Gabriel Magalhães for going down after an apparent head clash before he got back up and carried on.\n\nThere was indignation from the in-house commentators when Leandro Trossard also went to ground after an aerial clash in the 90th minute. In the background, it was easy to make out the chant from the Wolves fans: “Same old Arsenal, always cheating.” There was laughter and the corresponding emojis on the clip when Wolves equalised at the bitter end.\n\nThere was more from elsewhere later in the day. At tea time, Manchester City’s X account piped up with a three-year-old clip of their team playing keep-ball by the corner flag in the dying minutes of a 2-0 home victory over Newcastle. “Seeing out the win,” read the text with a tick emoji above footage of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish, well, managing the game to a successful conclusion. It was a mickey-take with an obvious target.\n\nThis is where Arsenal find themselves as they prepare for Sunday’s home game against Chelsea – the latest staging post in their draining push for the Premier League title. Their rivals, big and small, are lining up the pot shots, eager to have fun at their expense, to prey on their sensitivities. To drive a particular narrative and make Arsenal prisoners of it.\n\nThe Wolves TikTok clip overlooked a major detail when it came to Trossard. On as a 73rd-minute substitute, the winger was cleaned out by a shoulder barge from Santiago Bueno, who was on a yellow card. Trossard had eyes only for the high ball; the Wolves defender looked directly at him and left a calling card on his opponent’s jaw. A dazed Trossard was forced off after treatment, Arsenal relieved that he avoided injury, and how do you think the club’s doctors felt about essentially being accused of complicity in a plot to run down the clock?\n\nNobody thought about that. They were too busy enjoying the clip, which went viral for the reason that these things always do. It struck a chord. It fed a perception with which opposing fans are seemingly on board. Arsenal as the roughhouse guys – and not only when they are loading men into the six-yard box on corners. The ones that will do whatever it takes to win.\n\nView image in fullscreen Leandro Trossard’s injury at Wolves seemed to invoke opprobrium from the home side. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nArsenal were much better than Spurs. They deserved to beat them, which they did; to clear their heads after the trauma of Wolves. As an aside, it was only this Spurs team. Chelsea ought to be a tougher prospect. Yet Arsenal did get away with one in the 53rd minute as they led 2-1. Would it have been different if Randal Kolo Muani had not been penalised for the slightest of pushes into Gabriel’s back before he shot past David Raya? At the very least, Arsenal would have felt their anxiety levels rise.\n\nGabriel drew the contact to the referee’s attention in theatrical fashion, as he had done at Newcastle last September in a similar situation against Nick Woltemade. That day, the referee said no foul and Woltemade scored. This time, Gabriel got the decision.\n\nWhat did Gabriel do after the game? Did he a) keep his head down and quietly count his blessings? Or b) post a picture to social media of him holding a hand of cards with the four of hearts visible, signifying his team’s four goals? He went for the latter, even tagging the Spurs forward Richarlison. Cue a host of diving memes in the responses. Was goading really the right option given the climate around the club? On the other hand, you have to admire Gabriel’s chutzpah.\n\nMikel Arteta’s response to what we are obliged to call the “outside noise” has been to narrow the focus; to dial up the intensity while also talking up his players and their mindset. The manager has his eyes on the prize and there are a number of points that need to be made, beginning with the feeling towards him and his side in coaching circles.\n\nTowards the end of January, Pep Guardiola described Arsenal as the “best team in the world” and it did not sound like just mind games from the City manager. The Wolves head coach, Rob Edwards, messaged Arteta after last week’s game to say that Arsenal were the best side in the league and there have been others in their positions who have privately expressed the highest admiration for what Arteta is doing. Namely, how Arsenal press, massing men around the ball, cutting off the passing lanes, forcing turnovers. How they dominate in possession, playing on the front foot, creating overloads, moving it quickly. The watchwords are remorselessness and control.\n\nAccording to Opta, Arsenal have had seven yellow cards for time-wasting in the league this season – the same number as Chelsea and behind only Bournemouth and Fulham, who each have eight. They are the seventh-worst offenders for the average time of delays for restarts, taking in set pieces and goal-kicks. They sit behind Sunderland, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Newcastle, Leeds and Burnley on the list in that order.\n\nArteta and his players remain at the centre of a storm, buffeted by ill winds, Chelsea ready to bring the latest of them. If Arsenal hold their nerve, they will have done it the hard way."

            "content": "“I just want to have my name out there to the point where when someone hears it they know instantly who is being talked about,” says the Chelsea full-back Chloe Sarwie. “I want to be that player who can amaze people constantly and that is up there as one of the best.”\n\nYou could be forgiven for viewing this level of confidence as arrogant, but you would be wrong. The talented 17-year-old defender comes across as grounded, intelligent, hard-working and humble, but her edge is a steely belief in her football.\n\nSarwie is speaking to the Guardian shortly before signing her first professional contract, four months after her debut in the 1-1 draw with Twente in the Champions League and three months after her first call-up to the England Under-23s.\n\nSarwie is back with the under‑23s for next month’s games against France and the Netherlands, one of two 17-year-olds considered good enough to compete alongside those vying for a chance in the senior side (the other is Erica Meg Parkinson, who plays her club football in Portugal). Last summer, at 16, she was in the squad that competed at the Under-19 Euros in Poland. “I was taken aback and I didn’t really have any expectations so it was incredible,” she says.\n\n“It’s honestly a really intense environment and every training session everyone just wants to one-up each other. It gets really competitive and just being around that wanting-to-win group was incredible.”\n\nHer Chelsea debut in October, when still 16, came as a surprise. “As soon as I got the nod from Sonia [Bompastor] that I’d be coming on for Sandy [Baltimore] and making my debut, I was just down on the sideline, shocked but pumped and ready to get on the pitch,” says Sarwie, who entered the fray against Twente in the 73rd minute.\n\nShe impressed instantly, playing with an admirable fearlessness. “Honestly, when I stepped on that pitch, I didn’t know what to do, I didn’t know how to play, but I was just trying to play my part for the team, fit in and see what I could do. Towards the end of the game, I was being myself a bit more and the more playing time I’m getting, the more I’m able to express myself, but my full self hasn’t come out yet.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Chloe Sarwie (right) made her Chelsea debut in the Champions League draw with Twente last October. Photograph: Chris Lee/Chelsea FC/Getty Images\n\nChelsea are well equipped at right-back, with two of the world’s best in Lucy Bronze and Ellie Carpenter at their disposal, but at left-back there is a hole. With Baltimore performing well in the position but naturally a more attacking player and Niamh Charles out with an ankle injury, there have been some opportunities for Sarwie, against Crystal Palace in the FA Cup and West Ham and Tottenham in the Women’s Super League.\n\nShould her development continue at its accelerated pace there is also the chance to stake a claim in the senior England squad that has had question marks at left‑back under Sarina Wiegman. London City Lionesses’ Poppy Pattinson is the latest to receive a call-up with an eye on finding a solution to the conundrum.\n\nSarwie was introduced to the Chelsea senior side in pre-season. It was “quite exciting but also quite nerve-racking”, though training and playing with the first team has been hugely beneficial. “It’s a great challenge and I love being challenged and going up against these players, seeing how their level compares to mine and how I can get to that level,” says Sarwie.\n\n“Obviously, Lucy’s at England as well and being able to have that connection is great, even though I’m in one of the lower age groups because, ultimately, I’m learning how I can then progress to that next step and be part of the senior squad. That’s where she can give me tips and show what it takes.”\n\nSarwie began playing football in the park on her own, light on her feet thanks to ballet from the ages of two until eight. “I used to turn up to ballet with muddy tights after playing football and rolling around in the mud for a good hour or two. But ballet had a big impact on my journey as a football player as my dribbling playing style kind of links back to it. Ballet made me light on my feet. I also had to adapt from a ballet mindset, from a solo stage, to a football mindset and a team performance stage.”\n\nIt was in the park where coaches would approach her and tell her she should be playing for a club and eventually she thought: “Why not?” After a season at Millwall, she had trials at Arsenal and Chelsea and had offers from both. “I had to pick Chelsea because it was closer,” she says. “I let my family down on that one because they’re all Arsenal supporters, but oh well.”\n\nShe juggles playing and training with studying for her BTec in engineering and her mum, Jean, who is a teacher at her school, is the force that has enabled her to pursue football. She takes her laptop everywhere, to catch up with coursework, with one day a week spent in the classroom.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie takes a selfie with fans after featuring in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace. Photograph: Sport Press Photo/Alamy\n\nSarwie is having to contend with an influx of information. “It’s mad trying to switch the brain from studying engineering to football and back,” she says. “I’m still taking in everything in relation to the first team. I have all that information coming at me and then I have to go home, switch off and then do my work and it’s all a bit chaotic.”\n\nOn the pitch, there is also a balance to be struck between what is being asked of her and instinct. “Sometimes on the pitch I can be quite hesitant because I’m trying to think about what I should do at that moment instead of what I want to do, because that’s sometimes two different things. The coach wants me to do something but I want to do something else in the moment and it’s about quickly processing which one I should do.\n\n“Every day I’m getting new information coming in and I’m just trying to soak that up but trying to show myself on the pitch and putting those words into actions on the pitch can be quite difficult and it’s going to be like that for a while because of my age.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sarwie practised ballet until the age of eight. ‘It made me light on my feet,’ she says.

Breathing techniques on the pitch really help me stay calm and I’ve been told I look arrogant doing this, but chewing gum on the pitch makes me relax as well.\n\n“I want to be that person that looks in place and calm with the rest of the team, that calms that team down. I don’t want to be nervous when I get the ball, or for them to be nervous when I get the ball, I want to get the ball and to express myself as much as possible with it.”"

But while we've all been glued to the carnage unfolding in the Middle East, a number of important things have gone slightly under the radar.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThings like Trump's allies planning the basis of a coup d'etat. And Pete Hegseth finding the time to pit AI firms against each other to find out which is the least ethical. And the President congratulating a congressman accused of having an affair with an aide, who later died after setting herself on fire.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHere's a few things you might have missed while you were watching Donald Trump blow up Iran.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n1. Trump's allies are plotting an 'emergency' to seize control of elections\n\nAs we predicted weeks ago, people in Trump's orbit have pulled together a plan to confect a \"national emergency\" in order to allow Trump's White House to seize control of elections ahead of November's midterms, in which Trump's Republicans are expected to get a pasting. A 17-page draft executive order has been circulated that claims China interfered in the 2020 election. It uses that claim as a basis to declare a 'national emergency', under which Trump could seize more control over voting.\n\nThat would include mandatory voter ID across the country as well as banning postal voting. (Remember that Truth Social post a few weeks ago when Trump said Voter ID will be mandatory whether congress votes for it o not?)\n\nPerhaps even more chillingly, the order would force every US voter to re-register, presenting proof of citizenship, in order to cast a ballot in November's midterms.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n2. Wait, what? China?\n\nNot only does it claim China rigged the 2020 election, but that it did so on behalf of (check your bingo cards...) Hunter Biden.\n\nYeah, it's all nonsense. Not a lick of evidence. But that's because...\n\n3. When we say allies...\n\n...the figures so far linked to the draft order include:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMichael Flynn - the former Trump National Security Advisor who served jail time for lying to the FBI about his contact with Russia ahead of Trump's first term\n\nMike Lindell - the MyPillow guy. Sitting somewhere between a QVC salesman and David Icke, Lindell was the last man standing in Trump's fight to steal the 2020 election. As well as selling bedding for Nazi-dogwhistle prices, Lindell has founded Lindell TV, an online streaming service where he can hawk his favourite conspiracy theories. His \"reporters\" are frequently called upon for questions at White House events.\n\nPatrick Byrne - the former CEO of Overstock.com and another die-hard election denier. He resigned from Overstock in 2019 after it emerged he'd had an intimate relationship with Maria Butina, a Russian agent.\n\n4. Trump says he knows nothing about it...but...\n\nTrump was asked about this on his way to Texas to give a speech last night. Asked if he was planning to announce a national emergency, he replied: \"Who told you that?\" Which is one of the answers you least want to hear in response to that question.\n\nHe went on to say he knew nothing about it. But then, that's what he said about Project 2025, on which he has based almost his entire policy platform.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n5. Trump says he's 'entitled' to one more term\n\n\"Time flies,\" Trump said during his speech at a modestly attended rally in Corpus Christi, Texas last night. \"Time flies...maybe we should ...maybe we do one more term. Should we do one more? One more term. Well, we're entitled to it, cos they cheated like hell in the second one. We would actually be entitled to it.\"\n\nFor absolute clarity, he is not entitled to it, and \"they\" did not cheat in the 2020 election. He lost it to Joe Biden.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\n6. 'Loving America' should be mandatory for voting\n\nLater in the speech, Trump suggested \"loving America\" should be a mandatory pre-requisite for the right to vote, which I suspect is not exactly what Jefferson had in mind.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n7. He kept giving shout-outs to a congressman who reportedly had an affair with an aide, who later set herself on fire\n\nTrump gave a big shout out to Tony Gonzales, the Republican ...which prompted a smattering of boos from the crowd. Why? Because Gonzales is currently facing calls - including from Republicans - to resign over an alleged affair with an aide who later died after setting herself on fire.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n8. Pete Hegseth's WarGames\n\nWhile top brass at the Pentagon and White House were apparently busy planning the attack on Iran, Pete Hegseth, the \"Secretary of War\" was busy starting a war between two of America's biggest AI firms.\n\nAnthropic, makers of the Claude chatbot (the one that has prompted a lot of idiots to buy Mac minis so they can get it to order groceries for them, or whatever), were in line for a big Pentagon contract.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut the whole thing blew up the other day after Anthropic refused to get rid of a few fundamental guardrails they installed in Claude to prevent it going haywire and acting out the 80s kids movie WarGames.\n\nThe bot can't be used to operate autonomous weapons, nor can it be used for mass surveillance of Americans, Anthropic said - much to Hegseth's displeasure.\n\nBecause they refused to change their minds, Hegseth threw his toys out of the pram and said he was going to declare Anthropic a supply chain risk - which makes it mored difficult for US government departments to use their services.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhen Anthropic stood their ground, Hegseth announced the Pentagon would now be entering into a new deal with ChatGPT-makers OpenAI. Who apparently have no issue helping to make autonomous weapons or AI spybots. Nice.\n\n9. CNN evacuated as Iran vows to retaliate\n\nAfter Iran vowed retaliation for this morning's strikes, CNN's team in UAE was forced to evacuate their studio and head to a bunker, with alarms blaring in the Abu Dhabi studio, which was quite the moment of drama.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent"

Labour fell to third in the vote, with the Greens winning in a constituency the party had held for almost 100 years.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the BBC ’s Newscast podcast, Ms Powell said Mr Burnham “probably would have” held the seat.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Ms Powell has now urged Labour to look at Mr Burnham’s popularity in Greater Manchester, and how to replicate it, explaining people “see in him someone who is on their side, someone who is delivering those Labour values and those Labour policies”.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe added: “We have to draw on that, make use of Andy Burnham, but also draw on that and reflect on how we could do that better nationally and better as a Government. And I know from talking to Keir many, many times over recent weeks, before this by-election and since, that that is something he is very focused on doing.” Mr Burnham has stayed quiet over the result in Gorton and Denton, while the PM has vowed to fight on despite the “disappointing” outcome of the poll.\n\nMs Powell’s intervention comes as the PM wrote to Labour members vowing to convince the public that his party were the face of progressive politics. Mr Starmer said: “I get it: people are rightly impatient to see more of the change they voted for in 2024. It’s my job to make sure that happens. And I’m working day in, day out to see it through.\n\n“Over the coming months, people will feel more of the change we are delivering on cost of living and more opportunities for people in our country. The majority of this country neither want the wrong-headed policies of Zack Polanski or the division of Nigel Farage. Our task in the coming months is to focus on that majority and ensure Labour is the voice and vehicle for the modern progressive Britain we all believe in. I don’t underestimate the challenge, but with your support, it’s a challenge we can, must and will win.”"

Shoppers who opt for the discount store's version would end up saving half the price for something that looks so similar.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Simply Panelled Six Cube Shelving Unit comes in a light oak-effect wood finish and costs shoppers £25 for the flat-pack unit. It comes in a versatile style that could be used in almost any room where homes need extra storage.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWriting online, B&M bosses said: \"Featuring a sleek oak finish and a chic panelled design, this Simply Panelled Six Cube Shelving Unit gives your space some rustic charm. Perfect for living rooms, bedrooms, and dining spaces, this shelving unit offers plenty of storage space for books, keepsakes, and more!\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe design is very similar to a £50 option available in IKEA stores across the country. The popular KALLAX unit comes in many sizes, from small two-cube units to massive 25-cube units.\n\nThe most similar to the B&M's is the six-cube set from IKEA, priced at £50 for the white stained oak effect version. The Swedish furniture company wrote on its website: \"The simple design with clean lines makes KALLAX flexible and easy to use at home. Choose whether to place it standing and use it as a shelving unit or lying and use it as a sideboard.\n\nView 3 Images The Simply Panelled Six Cube Shelving Unit\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Personalise the shelving unit with inserts and boxes to make it suit your needs. Display your favourite items on the open shelves or add inserts to create a personalised solution with closed storage.\"\n\nIKEA's unit does not come with any backing, unlike the B&M option, which has half of the cubes enclosed with stylish wooden slats to enhance decor and add interest.\n\nIn terms of size, the IKEA unit (111.5cm H x 76.5cm W x 39cm D) is larger than the B&M option (89cm H x 60cm W x 28cm D), making the bargain version ideal for those working with smaller spaces.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images IKEA's white stained oak effect KALLAX unit\n\nB&M also sells the same style unit in a nine-cube version for £35 for people wanting a bigger version, a size that is not available in the IKEA unit unless shoppers merge two separate units together. For more bargain furniture finds, click here for the full range on offer.\n\nThere is another similar 'IKEA-style' product also on offer at B&M, offering to 'keep rooms tidy' for under £20. The Sienna Two-Drawer Bedside Table could easily be mistaken for the £49 IKEA MALM at first glance.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "Shark steam mop pet owners say is 'quick and easy' for cleaning muddy paw prints is now under £40\n\nPet owners have been praising how efficient the Shark steam mop is at cleaning muddy paw prints off their floors, and it’s now on sale with 43% off, bringing it down to under £40\n\nView 3 Images The Shark Steam Mop is now on sale at Amazon (Image: Amazon)\n\nThe wet weather has meant a constant stream of muddy footprints and paw prints in your house, especially if you have pets. Whilst you can get your family to take their shoes off, trying to keep muddy paw prints to a minimum is a never ending job, which means you’re probably fed up with spending all your time on your hands and knees scrubbing the floors.\n\nAnd although winter is finally on the way out and spring is approaching, we’ve no doubt still got plenty of rainy showers to come, which means plenty of muddy marks on the horizon. So if your patience (and your back) can’t take it any more, we recommend taking a leaf out of fellow pet owners’ books, and snapping up the Shark Steam Mop whilst it's on sale.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuicker and more effective than a regular mop and bucket, and definitely easier on your joints than hand-cleaning your floors, the Shark Steam Mop is ideal for keeping floors clean and disinfected with minimal effort. Usually priced at £69.99, Amazon has just slashed the price of it down by 43%, meaning you can now snap it up for £39.99.\n\nThe Amazon purchase will get you the steam mop, two ultra-absorbent and quick-drying microfibre dirt grip pads and a filling flask, giving you everything you need to keep your floors spotless. You can use it on all types of hard flooring as long as it’s fully sealed, including laminate, tile, hardwood and vinyl.\n\nView 3 Images The mop helps kill bacteria and keep floors spotlessly clean (Image: Amazon)\n\nTo use it, just fill the large 375ml tank with water and then use the manual pump action to activate the steam. It heats up within 30 seconds so you can use it instantly, and the Shark Steam Mop doesn’t just clean, but sanitises too to make sure you’re getting rid of all that outside bacteria.\n\nYou also don’t need to worry about constantly forking out for new cleaning pads like you would with a mop, as the cleaning pads are machine washable and reusable. As you get two included, you can alternate between them to make sure you always have a clean one to hand.\n\nThere are other ways to help keep those muddy paws off your floors too, though. Plenty of shoppers have been racing to snap up the Muddy Mat Highly Absorbent Door Mat and Pet Rug which is also available on Amazon for just £17.89. Made from a microfibre cloth material, the mat helps absorb all the rain and mud from your pets paws before they enter the house, giving you less to clean up after their walk.\n\nYou could also give the portable Floof 20V Cordless Pet Paw Washer a try. It’s £50 from Argos and can be used on both cats and dogs, with a spinning silicone brush that cleans their paws without manual scrubbing.\n\nView 3 Images Shoppers have raved about the mop for being quick and efficient at cleaning (Image: Amazon)\n\nOne fellow pet owner raved about the Shark Steam Mop , saying: “I am really impressed with the steam mop - I ordered it for using on my kitchen floor tiles as with dogs and children it never looked clean especially in the autumn and winter with muddy paw prints.”\n\nThey also added: “It was really easy to set up and the instructions are easy to follow and understand. It came with a couple of pads but I have ordered extra so I have a constant supply. It is quite heavy especially when trying to manoeuvre into corners but should be fine for all people. The steam boost function is great for using in more stubborn stains or marks. I would recommend vacuuming before using as if you don’t - I found out - any crumbs or bits just get moved around rather than being trapped on the pad. I am really pleased with the results and it took no time at all to clean the floor and leave it sparking clean.”\n\nAnother happy shopper praised: “I love a gadget, this is amazing. I bought it discounted, but easy to use, not noisy at all, water capacity is good. No attachments needed, quick and efficient, gets the smallest of stain up, value for money, so glad I bought it.”\n\nWhilst a third simply stated the Shark Steam Mop was: “Easy to use, very effective.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHowever one shopper wrote: “It was ok. It heated up quickly but the pumping action became very annoying after a while, I’ve used other steam mops and without having to pump it makes life a lot easier. It wasn’t very good on hard stubborn stains, the cord length was ok but could have been longer. The whole thing was very easy to put together and use, but honestly I don’t feel like it did a good enough job to effectively get stains off tiled floors. It did however dry very quickly which was a plus, but I will be buying another different brand that is much more efficient and effective, with quicker results.”"

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring. A date and location has not yet been confirmed.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Pacquiao, 47, has a warm-up fight against Ruslan Provodnikov on April 18, almost a year after his draw with then-WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios."

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council. A cause of death has not been revealed\n\n'Excellent contender who was so unfortunate to be in the same era as legendary champs like Salvador Sanchez and Alexis Arguello,' one fan wrote on X. 'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

            "content": "New rules aimed at tackling time-wasting will come into force for this summer’s World Cup and could bring an end to the long-throw trend in the Premier League.\n\nThe measures, approved by football lawmaker The International Football Association Board (IFAB), will see the introduction of a countdown clock to apply to goal kicks and throw-ins.\n\nIf a referee believes a throw-in or goal kick is taking too long or is being deliberately delayed, a five-second visual countdown will begin.\n\nShould the ball not be back in play by the end of the countdown, the throw-in will be awarded to the opposition. In the case of a delayed goal kick, a corner will be given to the opposing side - as has been the case this season when goalkeepers have held on to the ball for too long.\n\nThe new rules will take effect on 1 June, ahead of this summer’s World Cup.\n\nBurnley goalkeeper Martin Dubravka was the first player penalised this season after holding the ball for more than eight seconds during his side’s clash with Tottenham Hotspur in August, conceding a corner as a result.\n\nThe measures could lead to the eradication of the long throw, with the average Premier League match losing 10 minutes and 43 seconds to delays before throw-ins this season - figures recorded prior to this weekend’s fixtures.\n\nLast season, the average delay stood at 8 minutes and 49 seconds.\n\nThe measures could lead to the eradication of the long throw, with the average Premier League match losing 10 minutes and 43 seconds to delays before throw-ins this season\n\nIFAB has also responded to the racism allegations involving Vinicius Junior and Gianluca Prestianni by announcing plans to develop measures addressing ‘players covering their mouth'\n\nSome of those delays will have been caused by substitutions, VAR checks and injuries, so they cannot all be attributed to slow throw-ins. That said, the increase suggests this has been the primary factor.\n\nThe timer will also apply to substituted players, who must leave the pitch within 10 seconds of the board being raised. Failure to do so will mean the replacement cannot enter the field until after the first stoppage following one minute of normal play.\n\nIFAB has also responded to the racism allegations involving Vinicius Junior and Gianluca Prestianni by announcing plans to develop measures addressing ‘players covering their mouth when confronting opponents during matches’.\n\nThe Benfica forward is being investigated by UEFA following allegations that he racially abused the Real Madrid winger during the first leg of their Champions League play-off in Lisbon earlier this month.\n\nThe investigation has been complicated by Prestianni covering his mouth with his shirt while speaking to Vinicius. The 20-year-old Argentine was handed a one-match suspension for the return leg.\n\nIFAB has also approved further measures to expand the powers of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), including allowing intervention where a yellow card has clearly been shown to the wrong team.\n\nThis will also apply to red cards resulting from a clearly incorrect second yellow. In some competitions, VAR may additionally be permitted to review a clearly wrongly awarded corner, provided the check can be completed immediately and without delaying the restart.\n\nIFAB will also conduct trials aimed at curbing ‘tactical timeouts’, particularly those prompted by goalkeepers receiving on-field treatment."

The diamond looks to be around 5 to 6 carats, with a truly bright appearance that suggests it’s of exceptional quality,' Taylor said to the Daily Mail.\n\n'If the diamond is natural and of exceptional quality, I’d estimate the ring to be worth upwards of £400,000.'\n\nLeclerc has been in two high-profile relationships before. He dated Italian model Giada Gianna for four years, with the couple splitting up in 2019.\n\nJoin the debate Is £400,000 too much for an engagement ring?\n\nLeclerc announced his engagement to 23-year-old model Alexandra Saint Mleux last year\n\nThe model and influencer has more than three million followers on Instagram alone\n\nAnd after that, the Formula 1 star was with famous architect Charlotte Sine, breaking up in December 2022.\n\nAs for Saint Mleux, the couple tend to keep their relationship out of the spotlight as much as possible. But back in June, they appeared on the red carpet together in New York for the premiere of the F1 movie.\n\nLeclerc will soon be turning his attention back to the track, with the Ferrari driver finishing fifth in the standings last season.\n\n\n\nThe first race of the new campaign will be the Australian GP on March 8."

            "content": "Inside my wild night at a Las Vegas casino with Floyd Mayweather: Boxing legend splashed out on caviar, fine whiskey and dropped $500 tips galore - but he baulked at spending his cash on post-night snack, writes Daily Mail's CHARLOTTE DALY\n\nFormer world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr has announced a surprise return to the ring, revealing plans for a fourth comeback that will begin with an exhibition against Mike Tyson before a blockbuster professional rematch with Manny Pacquiao later this year.\n\nThe rivals are set to meet again on September 19 at the Sphere - 11 years after their long-awaited 2015 showdown, when Mayweather claimed a unanimous-decision victory in the so-called 'Fight of the Century.'\n\nPacquiao, now 47, returned to action in July 2025 and fought Mario Barrios to a majority draw for the WBC welterweight title, insisting his comeback is driven by a desire to become world champion again. Mayweather, meanwhile, says he 'still has what it takes to set more records,' despite questions regarding his financial status.\n\nA recent report by Business Insider suggested Mayweather’s widely publicised fortune may be overstated, citing liens, outstanding debts, foreclosures and heavily leveraged assets including property holdings and his private jet.\n\nBack in 2024, I caught a glimpse of life inside Mayweather's orbit - a whirlwind casino evening filled with luxury excess, eye-watering tips and one surprising moment of frugality.\n\nFloyd Mayweather invited Daily Mail Sport for a night out in Las Vegas in an extraordinary offer\n\nCharlotte Daly hit the strip with Mayweather for a big night out in Las Vegas (pictured above)\n\nWhen Floyd Mayweather invites you for a night out in Las Vegas, you know it will be extraordinary. Picture this: the neon lights of the strip reflecting off luxury cars, the pulsating energy of the city that never sleeps, and 'Money Mayweather' at the centre of it all.\n\nFrom exclusive cigar lounges to high-roller tables, this was no ordinary night out. We sipped 'Good Money Whiskey' and indulged in caviar before discussing Mayweather's relationship with his father, the key moments in his career, the current crop of boxers, and his exhibition earnings.\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex. Fans clamoured for photos as he was greeted by models holding sparklers and a glowing Mayweather sign.\n\n'I do like the finer things in life', Mayweather quipped when asked about his love for luxury. 'I enjoy my cars and my watches but money don't make me, I make money.\n\n'I don't just keep all the money either, I give back to the less fortunate. My mother don't want for nothing, my loved ones don't want for anything. My team live a pretty good life. They travel the world, stay at five star hotels. But, the most important thing is, we are happy. I was happy before I made money. With or without money I am a happy person.'\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail with his Good Money Whiskey - a brand now available in 10 states including Nevada, California, and Florida.\n\nWhen handed the five-year-old whiskey, Mayweather joked, 'She's come all the way from the UK, and you're giving her the five-year-old whiskey? She deserves the 10-year!'\n\nThough not drinking himself, Mayweather passed the cocktail with a knowing smile. 'It's just like boxing,' he said confidently. 'I had the best team, so I got the best results. I've got the best team working on my brands, too. Just try it and you'll see.'\n\nIn true Mayweather style, he arrived at Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot, in a blacked-out SUV, wearing a £2,000 Gucci jacket and a gleaming Rolex\n\nWith a drink in hand, we moved to Mayweather's exclusive area, adorned with Le Bon Argent Champagne and attentive waitresses ensuring my glass was always full. Intrigued by highlight reels of his career playing on the screens overhead, I asked the boxing legend about his favorite memory.\n\n'I'm not sure which one was my favourite fight but the best fighter I ever fought probably was Manny Pacquiao. I can see why he won so many fights, it's all the moves he would make. But, I reckon the roughest fight I ever had was Emanuel Augustus, he was very tough competitor. When I faced him, I think he was 26 with 14 losses but extremely tough.\n\n'That being said, I think around half of my 50 fights were world title fights, so they were all good fights'.\n\nMayweather faced and defeated some of the biggest names in boxing, including Manny Pacquiao, Oscar De La Hoya, and Canelo Alvarez. He also claimed world titles in five different weight classes: Super Featherweight, Lightweight, Light Welterweight, Welterweight, and Light Middleweight.\n\nBut the true highlight of his career was walking away unharmed—a poignant topic given his father and uncle, Roger, both suffered neurological damage resulting in memory loss.\n\n'The real highlight of my career is that I am still able to communicate. That I am still able to speak well. I am still able to read and write. I am able to spend time with my children and I am able to travel. I still have all my faculties. That's the part about my career I am most pleased with. Not everyone gets that luxury and I've seen it first hand.'\n\nMayweather's relationship with his father has been complex but pivotal. Mayweather Sr. was instrumental in shaping his son's career, developing the defensive style that became his hallmark. Despite public disagreements and periods of estrangement, their bond remains strong.\n\n'My dad was my inspiration growing up. Without my dad I wouldn't have any of this. Without my dad I wouldn't have the crazy real estate portfolio I have. I wouldn't have met my two best friends, James McNair and Ricki Brazil. I wouldn't be here with you today. My dad is my driving force, my dad is everything to me.'\n\nFans clamoured for photos with him as he made his way to Eight Lounge, a chic cigar spot\n\nA stark contrast to when Mayweather lashed out at his father in 2011, shouting: 'You couldn't fight for s***. You weren't nothing but a motherf***ing cab driver... bum a** trainer. You weren't s*** as a fighter, so how you gonna be something as a trainer. Get the f*** out my gym f*****t!'.\n\nWhile other kids played, Mayweather's childhood was a whirlwind of responsibilities, juggling time between caring for his drug-addict mother and training with his father.\n\n'My dad was about business, ever since I was a kid. From 1985, my dad had me running five miles a day. He wouldn't let me run in sneakers either. He made me run five miles every day in combat boots while I was a child.\n\n'He also brought me out into the garden and made me chop wood. He always told me, there is no room for excuses. He said no matter how many fights you win, it's never good enough, you can always get better. There is always room for growth.\n\n'But, my dad gave me structure. He helped mould me into the man I am today. A man of honour, a man of dignity. A stand-up guy. A person that believes he can get better. It's all because of my father.'\n\nAs we chatted, one of Floyd's friends casually offered spoonfuls of caviar around the room. This wasn't your average caviar; it was the kind that likely costs more than my entire monthly salary. The nonchalant manner in which it was served, however, made it seem like an everyday snack.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie Griffin, a comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables.\n\nHaving accompanied him to the high-roller area, I watched in awe as players casually dropped $500k per round on craps. It was clear I'd be spectating rather than participating in this high-rolling spectacle.\n\nA fixture on the Vegas Strip with his 7,000-square-foot gentleman's club and top-tier boxing gym, Mayweather took charge behind the bar, crafting an Old Fashioned cocktail\n\nWhile Mayweather wasn't one to splurge at the tables, he was exceptionally generous with his tips. When $500 slipped from his pocket, he handed it to a waitress without hesitation and quickly pulled out another $500 for her colleague, making sure everyone felt appreciated.\n\nMayweather's wealth stems from his boxing prowess. Known for his defensive mastery and unmatched ring IQ, he earned the nickname 'Pretty Boy' for his flawless, unmarked face. He firmly believes no boxer will ever match his unique skills.\n\n'There will never be another boxer like me because my IQ was just on another level. You've got guys that have fast hands, you've got guys who have great punching power but they will never compete with my IQ.\n\n'My IQ was just on a whole different level. I could make adjustments that other people wouldn't be able to do. Go look at the Shane Mosley fight. Guy hit me with a couple of good shots, I came back the next round and put on a master class.\n\n'I was zoned in and knew exactly what he was going to do. I didn't hear the crowd, I didn't hear my trainer, I just listened to myself. I knew exactly what he was going to do. I had the ability to turn a fight on its head like that. Completely change the dynamic of a fight. That's what it takes, a sharp mind, a good chin and the heart of a lion.'\n\nYet, despite his undefeated boxing record (50-0) and iconic status, Mayweather acknowledged personal defeats beyond the ring.\n\n'Losing my uncle was a defeat. Losing my grandmother was a defeat. Losing my housekeeper of 20-something years was a defeat. Losing the mother of my children was a defeat. Losing my best friend was a defeat. I have been defeated in ways like that. Everything you go through in life is an experience you can grow from. I just try to use those experiences to become stronger every day.'\n\nMayweather's resilience in the face of such personal trials is mirrored in his approach to the racism he faced during his career.\n\nEddie Griffin, comedian from American sitcom Malcolm & Eddie, flitted around the room casually cracking jokes before diving into the high-stakes action at the casino tables\n\nGriffin joking told Mayweather he was going to steal a couple bottles of his whiskey\n\n'You're going to get racism and you're going to have to deal with it. I knew I was going to deal with it but that never stopped me from being who I wanted to be. It never stopped me from believing in myself.\n\n'It was never going to stop me from taking myself to the top. I knew I was the best and nothing was going to hold me back. There are many fighters that will come after me that will experience the same thing.\n\n'I want them to be great and I don't want them to be held back by it. I want them to surpass me if they can. Records are there to be broken but there will never be another Floyd Mayweather. I know that for a fact.'\n\nEven in retirement, Mayweather keeps his love for boxing alive through exhibition bouts, taking on the likes of Deji Olatunji, Tenshin Nasukawa, and Logan Paul.\n\nHowever, the pinnacle was his 2017 clash with MMA's Conor McGregor. While Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and LeBron James collectively earned $259 million that year, Mayweather surpassed that sum in a single night, shattering boxing's pay-per-view record with 6.5 million buys.\n\n'People have such a problem with my exhibitions. Jeff Bezos is well off but he's still working. Warren Buffett, he's probably in his 90's now and he's still working. The Walton's who own Walmart are still working. Elon Musk is still working. So, it's okay for me to work.\n\n'There is no risk with these exhibitions. I am taking on former MMA guys and YouTubers. They can't get near me. It's not a crime for me to have some fun with them and entertain the crowd.\n\n'I feel like I deserve it. I am still one of the most talked fighters in the sport of boxing and I'm not even boxing professionally anymore. So, it's only right I am getting the payday to match it. I have plenty of offers I could show you on my phone. $300million, $100million, $50million, $20million, $17million. They are all offers sat on my phone right now. It all depends but if you pay, we play. It's as simple as that.'\n\nMayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90 (pictured above)\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'\n\nThe hilarious encounter ended with him handing over the money and taking the doughnuts\n\nDespite having the potential to rake in $300million from an exhibition bout and being nicknamed 'Money Mayweather,' the 47-year-old had a hilariously human moment at the end of our night out.\n\nJust as Brits might hit a kebab shop on their way home, Mayweather popped into the local doughnut shop. After ordering two boxes of doughnuts, Mayweather was floored when he was told the total would be $90.\n\nPulling out a thick wad of cash, he went to pay before pausing dramatically, spreading the bills across his hands and playfully quipping 'I've got the money, I just don't want to spend it!'.\n\nMayweather will return to the ring this summer for a rematch against John Gotti III - the grandson of the late mob boss - having first faced the 31-year-old back in June 2023, with the fight ending in chaos after a brawl broke out when people stormed the ring.\n\n\n\nThe Good Money is a global brand created in direct partnership with Floyd Mayweather. The brand produces high-quality Champagne and Whisky, with their bourbon available to purchase at large retailers such as Total Wine, Specs, Lee's Liquors and WalMart."

            "content": "Richard Keys forced off air at Middle East-based broadcaster with UK government issuing 'take immediate shelter' warning to Brits abroad following US bombing of Iran\n\nRichard Keys was forced off air with beIN Sports after the UK government warned Brits abroad to 'take immediate shelter' following the US bombing of Iran.\n\nThe former Sky Sports presenter took to X, writing: 'Thank you all for your messages. It was a bit lively earlier. I don’t have space to express my feelings about that idiot Trump. No show today.\n\n'You’ll be in the capable hands of our colleagues in London. Thoughts & prayers for everyone in our region. Ramadan Kareem.'\n\nHis comment came after the UK government's foreign office had issued a stark warning.\n\n'Due to reported missile attacks, British nationals in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates should immediately shelter in place,' came the instruction.\n\n'Remain indoors in a secure location, avoid all travel and follow instructions from the local authorities.'\n\nRichard Keys was forced off air after Brits abroad were warned to take shelter\n\nSmoke rises in Iran after a bomb strike from the US and Israel with conflict escalating\n\nKeys, who has lived in Qatar for 13 years while working as a presenter for the sports channel, has been told by the network that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of the football season but is still working up until that point.\n\nOn Saturday morning, however, he was unable to take to the airwaves, with the frightening instability in the Middle East causing chaos in the region.\n\nThe US and Israel launched an attack on Iran, with President Donald Trump warning 'major combat operations' are taking place, as they aim for regime change.\n\nIsrael say Iran have launched retaliatory strikes of their own and explosions have been heard in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait.\n\nDoha, the capital of Qatar, is next to largest US airbase in the Middle East at Al Udaid, which could be one of the targets for Iranian strikes.\n\nKeys and beIN are based in Qatar and the presenter made it clear what he thought of the military action, calling Trump an 'idiot'.\n\nIn a video statement to the world, Trump had earlier urged the Iranian people to rise up and topple the clerical government.\n\n'When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,' he declared.\n\nHe also said the Iranian army would be given 'immunity' if they laid down arms - vowing that they would face 'certain death' if they chose the alternative.\n\nKeys called US president Donald Trump an 'idiot' after he was forced off air\n\nEarlier this year, the Iranian government killed 6,480 during widespread protests against their rule. Trump said the government 'would pay a big price' and promised help is on the way.\n\nThe ramifications of the conflict and possible escalation are still not known but the impact on the region is already significant, with Keys' no-show just a microscopic example.\n\nThe controversial broadcaster and long-time colleague Andy Gray, 70, have resided in Doha since 2013, two years after they both lost their jobs at Sky Sports in the wake of a sexism scandal.\n\nA series of sexist remarks made by Keys and Gray about female assistant referee Sian Massey were picked up and leaked in January 2011 when they thought their microphones were off.\n\nGray was sacked by Sky Sports after a video showing him making inappropriate comments to presenter Charlotte Jackson was released. Keys resigned from his £500,000-a-year role shortly afterwards.\n\nKeys, 68, is set to move in permanently with his 37-year-old wife, Lucie Rose, with whom he has been in a long-distance relationship since they secretly married in a private £20,000 ceremony in Devon in June 2023.\n\nHis son Joshua and daughter Jemma, who was previously one of Lucie Rose's closest friends before her romantic involvement with Keys, did not attend the wedding.\n\nThe presenter split with Julia Keys after 36 years of marriage when news of his shock relationship emerged in 2016, with his ex-wife revealing how the affair 'devastated' her as she recovered from thyroid cancer and also wrecked the lives of their two children.\n\nLucie Rose, above, was previously one of Keys' daughter's best friends before their romance\n\nKeys (centre) pictured with his ex-wife Julia (left) and their daughter Jemma (right)\n\nJulia said the affair ruined the career of her Hollyoaks actress daughter as she spiralled into alcoholism and depression. Jemma also faced legal action over a string of abusive texts she sent to Lucie Rose before charges were dropped by prosecutors.\n\nSince joining beIN Sports, Keys and Gray have fronted coverage of the Premier League and Champions League across 24 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, while also presenting for the network at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nIt is also claimed that the broadcasting pair could quit live football presenting altogether when they return to the UK.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for Richard Keys told the Mail: 'Richard decided some months ago that, after 13 great years, the time had come to leave beIN with Andy. Following his decision it was mutually agreed that his final broadcasts for the channel would be in May this year.'"

            "content": "Ashley Barnes saw an equaliser for Burnley vs Brentford ruled out for handball deep into added time during a chaotic defeat for his side at Turf Moor. At 4-3 down, it was a case of last chance saloon for Scott Parker's Clarets, as Maxime Esteve launched the ball into the Brentford box from his own half eight minutes into additional time.\n\nJoe Worrall then connected to put the ball on a plate for Barnes, with the late super sub firing home from close range to level matters as the home crowd erupted in jubilation. However, celebrations were short-lived as VAR swiftly stepped in to scrutinise the build-up, identifying that Barnes had handled the ball before his strike.\n\nIn heart-breaking fashion, referee Sam Barrott then announced his decision to rule to goal out, shortly before the full-time whistle sounded and Burnley left the encounter empty-handed despite their best efforts. Explaining his decision, Barrott was head saying on the field: \"After review - 35 [Ashley Barnes], accidentally handles the ball. That leads to a direct goal. My final decision will be defensive free-kick to Brentford.\"\n\nThere will be more to follow on this breaking news story and Mirror Sport will bring you the very latest updates, pictures and video as soon as possible.\n\nPlease check back regularly for updates on this developing story."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Now 30 years since the Dallas Cowboys' last Super Bowl appearance, owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he has let the fans down with his team's championship drought.\n\n\"I really can't accept just the thought of winning one Super Bowl and then what?\" Jones said Friday night from the NFL scouting combine. \"I've got more time on my clock than that in my mind. And so I don't see it that way. I see a chance to put a team together and basically be knocking at the edge and get another one or get a chance at a another one.\n\n\"It runs that way in my view. ... Make no mistake about it now, if you told me I could, because I've done a lot of hitchhiking in my life. ... I'd start here with you right now and hitchhike back to Dallas to win a Super Bowl.\"\n\nAfter a 7-9-1 finish in 2025, Jones promised change. One change will be the team's approach to free agency.\n\nThe Cowboys have not relied heavily on free agency in years, choosing to pick their spots to shore up holes on the roster with cost-effective players.\n\n\"I would bet that we will spend more money in free agency than we have,\" Jones said.\n\nTo do so, the Cowboys will first have to create salary cap room. Well over the $301.2 million cap that was set Friday, they will restructure the contracts of quarterback Dak Prescott, wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and left guard Tyler Smith, which will create $66 million of room.\n\nJones said the Cowboys will rework the contracts of defensive tackles Kenny Clark, Quinnen Williams and Osa Odighizuwa, who are scheduled to count around $63 million against the cap. With Clark and Williams, the Cowboys can look to add voidable years to their contracts then restructure that way.\n\n\"I want you to know that the only way to push more [out] is for me to go borrow some of my future, OK?\" Jones said. \"Expect me to go borrow some of my future.\"\n\nTo Jones, it goes beyond his personal Super Bowl wishes.\n\n\"I look at where we are with Dak and I look at where he is in his career. And I look at some of the pluses that we have on our front and what we think we can do there. And what we can do with [George] Pickens and Lamb and what we can do with our running back that we just signed [Javonte Williams],\" Jones said. \"And so all of those things I want to do everything we possibly can to stop somebody and to basically win some third downs more than we did last year. And so I think that would be the area that you would see me bust the budget. Where you would see me do that is what we're doing defensively.\n\n\"And I would expect anybody that's a Cowboy fan or a critic of the Cowboys to say, 'Duh, that's not hard to see, Jerry, to do.' But I guess what I'm doing is saying, yes, I intend to do that if given the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Cowboys defense finished at or near the bottom of the league in yards and points allowed in 2025. Christian Parker has been hired as the new defensive coordinator, and Jones acknowledged the need for more than just one or two new players, while also saying players that were on the defense in 2025 will be better in 2026 \"because the situation has changed.\"\n\nWith two first-round picks, the Cowboys have an opportunity to add more talent to their defense. Jones would not rule out the possibility of making trades, like the additions of Williams from the New York Jets and Clark from the Green Bay Packers for Micah Parsons.\n\n\"I don't know that I'd expect it but we have the ammunition to be good at it,\" Jones said. \"And I wouldn't hesitate to be good at it if it will help our team and help the timeline that we're talking about.\"\n\nNow 83, Jones was introspective at times during the hourlong meeting with reporters. His resolve to win a championship is strong.\n\n\"It's every bit the prize of anything I have, with the exception of family and your love for family,\" Jones said. \"I guess what I would say is make no mistake about it, I don't have a higher priority than to go and win a Super Bowl.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- After Denver Nuggets superstar Nikola Jokic tumbled to the Paycom Center court early in the fourth quarter Friday night, he determined that he needed to react to what he considered a dirty tactic by Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort.\n\nA chippy game between rivals who faced off in a seven-game series in last season's Western Conference semifinals escalated into a heated confrontation at that point, resulting in Dort's ejection and double technical fouls on Jokic and Oklahoma City center Jaylin Williams.\n\nThe fracas began when Dort appeared to trip Jokic as he ran up the court with 8:03 remaining in the fourth quarter. Dort backed into Jokic and stuck out his right foot, knocking down the big man, who quickly pounced to his feet to angrily confront Dort.\n\n\"It's an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction,\" Jokic said after the Nuggets' 127-121 overtime loss to the defending champions. \"There is no such thing -- I think there's not supposed to be those things on a basketball floor. So, it was just an unnecessary move and a necessary reaction by me.\"\n\nAfter Jokic chest-bumped Dort, Williams rushed over to intervene. Jokic and Williams exchanged shoves and grabbed each other's jerseys as a scrum of players, coaches, officials and staffers formed around them and eventually separated them.\n\n\"Just competing,\" Williams told ESPN. \"Two teams competing, that's it. That's all I got.\"\n\nAfter a review, the foul called against Dort was upgraded to a flagrant foul 2, resulting in an automatic ejection. Crew chief James Williams told a pool reporter that the officials \"deemed [Dort's] contact on Jokic to be unnecessary and excessive with a high potential for injury.\" Williams also cited the contact leading to an \"altercation that did not dissolve\" as a reason for upgrading it to a flagrant foul 2.\n\n\"I will say this: If [Williams] is running up the floor and gets tripped, we expect a flagrant 2 from this point forward,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"That's all. If that's the precedent, if that becomes a malicious play and flagrant 2 is the line in the sand on that, we would expect that if it's [Williams]. We would expect that if it's anybody. And if that's the case, we're good.\"\n\nAsked if he believed the play was ruled a flagrant 2 because the foul was committed against a three-time MVP, Daigneault said: \"No, I'm not going to answer the question like that. I said what I needed to say about it.\"\n\nNuggets star Nikola Jokic confronts Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who was called for a flagrant foul 2 after an apparent trip in the fourth quarter. Jokic and OKC's Jaylin Williams received technical fouls. Photo by Joshua Gateley/Getty Images\n\nThe referees determined that the actions of Jokic and Jaylin Williams during the altercation did not rise to the level of an ejection, James Williams said in the pool report.\n\nThe fracas overshadowed the return of reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had 36 points on 12-of-29 shooting and dished out nine assists in 34 minutes. Gilgeous-Alexander sat out the overtime period because he had reached his minutes limit after missing the previous nine games because of an abdominal strain suffered Feb. 3.\n\nGilgeous-Alexander was called for a technical foul in the first quarter when he responded to Jokic's post-whistle contact by throwing the ball at him. James Williams told the pool reporter that Jokic was not called for a technical on that play because the officials determined that his contact with his left forearm did not rise to the level of an unsportsmanlike act.\n\n\"They're obviously a high-level team, we're a high-level team, and we've seen each other a lot in the past couple of years, so we might be a little bit more into the game just because we know the opponent,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"It was fun. It was good out there. End-of-season basketball is like that. It's that chippy, that physical, so it was good to get one of those in the regular season.\"\n\nThe Nuggets fell to 4-7 since Jokic returned from a monthlong absence, including 1-6 in clutch games (within five points in the final five minutes) during that span. Jokic recorded his league-leading 22nd triple-double with 23 points, 17 rebounds and 14 assists against the Thunder, but his uncharacteristic recent shooting struggles continued, as he went 9-of-25 from the floor and 2-of-10 from 3-point range.\n\nJokic, who was 3-of-5 from the free throw line, animatedly protested no-calls after several of his shots. There were also multiple instances of Jokic bumping and shoving with Thunder players during the game.\n\n\"I think his frustration is sometimes because the game's officiated differently out on the floor than it is near the basket, and I think he was reacting to what was being done to him,\" Nuggets coach David Adelman said. \"And his reaction's not going to be to cower away. He's competitive. ... I know why he's frustrated. I can feel his frustration with all the contact out there. He shot five free throws.\n\n\"It's just part of the game. The closer you get to the basket, it seems like for a bigger guy, it seems like it's called a little bit different, but he has to react to that the right way. Concentrate and finish through contact. And obviously with Dort's play, I think that took it to a different level for him. He felt like it was malicious, also.\"\n\nThe Nuggets and Thunder meet again March 9 in Oklahoma City."

Including the playoffs, it was the club's third-highest percentage in a game in the shot clock era (since 1954-55), behind 67.9% in 1984 and 67.0% in 1990, according to ESPN Research.\n\nThe Celtics also shot 64.7% from the 3-point line Friday, which equated to an 80.8% effective field goal percentage -- the highest in the shot clock era. Effective field goal percentage measures shooting efficiency by adjusting for the fact that 3-pointers are worth more than two-point shots\n\nAll-Star Jaylen Brown led the way, finishing with 28 points, nine assists and seven rebounds. But he got plenty of support from his teammates, with trade deadline acquisition Nikola Vucevic adding 28 points and 11 rebounds for his third double-double as a member of the Celtics.\n\n\"I thought we just did a good job reading the game,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"I thought we made the right reads throughout most of the entire game. I thought tonight Vooch really looked comfortable in his offensive reads and his offensive screening. He unlocked a lot of stuff for us.\"\n\nAll 13 Celtics players scored, with Boston committing only three turnovers after halftime.\n\n\"We just try to read the game and take what's there,\" Brown said.\n\nBoston, winners of five of its six games since the All-Star break, will wait to see if Sunday night's home matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers will mark the return of Tatum.\n\nThe game, originally scheduled to be played earlier in the day, was moved by NBC into an 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, creating speculation it could signal Tatum's plan to return.\n\nIt's been 41 weeks since Tatum ruptured his right Achilles tendon in May in the waning minutes of the Celtics' loss to the New York Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nThe Celtics are required by the NBA to release an initial injury report by 5 p.m. ET on Saturday ahead of Sunday's home game against the 76ers.\n\nAfter practicing with the Celtics' G League team two weeks ago, Tatum said he hadn't decided whether he would return.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that I'm coming back or I'm not, it's just following the plan. So it's just another step,\" Tatum said. \"I don't know percentage. I just know I feel a little bit better every day. I just try to focus on that.\"\n\nTatum said in the same interview that he is also mindful of not wanting to disrupt the progress of a Celtics team that at 39-20 sits in second place in the Eastern Conference standings.\n\n\"I'm just hyper aware of what's going on. I think it would just stem from that. Obviously, I know what I bring to the table and bring to the team. But I'm also aware that these guys have been playing extremely well,\" Tatum said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

Spohr was killed, and Wood survived, though she died a year after the shooting.\n\nPlacer County District Attorney Morgan Gire said in a statement Friday that Spohr and Wood were loving grandparents and that Serafini's crimes greatly impacted family members and friends.\n\n\"The impact of this attack has extended far beyond the immediate victims, deeply affecting family members and the broader community, and highlighting the lasting harm caused by deliberate violence,\" Gire said.\n\nSerafini's attorney did not return requests for comment.\n\nDuring his sentencing hearing, Serafini addressed the court and maintained his innocence, according to MyNews4. He said he was out partying with his wife the night of the shooting and described himself as a \"broken, imperfect man that makes mistakes.\"\n\nSerafini was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 1992. In a career spanning 11 years, the left-hander played for the Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies.\n\nProsecutors said Serafini hated his wife's wealthy parents and was heard saying he was willing to pay $20,000 to have them killed, according to the Sacramento Bee. Prosecutors showed jurors transcripts of angry emails and text messages between Serafini and his in-laws.\n\nDuring the six-week trial, Serafini's attorney, David Dratman, argued that there was no physical evidence linking his client to the crime scene. Dratman told the jury that although Serafini had a rocky relationship with his in-laws, he did not have a motive to kill them.\n\nAfter his conviction, Serafini filed multiple motions for a new trial, but those were denied.\n\nSerafini will serve his sentence at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, according to the Placer County District Attorney's Office."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Ghana has launched its revised Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) Policy, marking what officials describe as a bold national reset to secure a stronger foundation for children from birth to age eight.\n\nThe initiative, led by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection through its Department of Children, is anchored on the theme: “Invest in Early Childhood for a Brighter Future.” It reinforces the government’s commitment to ensuring that every Ghanaian child receives the right start in life.\n\nDelivering the keynote address, the Sector Minister, Agnes Naa Momo Lartey, described the revised policy as a decisive national commitment to promoting the survival, growth, development and protection of children.\n\nShe explained that the updated framework draws on evidence from previous implementation, lessons learned over the years and emerging global best practices. It also aligns with Ghana’s national development priorities and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nCiting research on the critical importance of the first 1,000 days of life, the Minister stressed that investment in early childhood development is not optional but strategic, key to improving national productivity, promoting equity and securing long-term prosperity.\n\nAccording to her, the policy adopts a “whole-of-government and whole-of-society” approach built on key pillars including health, nutrition, early learning, responsive caregiving, safety and inclusion.\n\nAs part of efforts to strengthen support at the family level, she announced that the Ministry, with support from UNICEF, is developing a National Parenting Strategy.\n\nThe strategy aims to equip parents and caregivers with practical, evidence-based tools to nurture and protect their children.\n\nThe Minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment under the leadership of John Mahama to placing children at the centre of national development.\n\nShe called for coordinated action across ministries, Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs), communities and families to ensure no child is left behind.\n\nProviding an institutional perspective, the Chief Director of the Ministry, Dr Afisah Zakariah, described the revised policy as a national milestone that guarantees children the best possible start in life.\n\nShe commended the Department of Children for leading the technical review and acknowledged the contributions of government agencies, development partners, traditional authorities and communities in shaping what she described as a collaborative and evidence-based framework responsive to the needs of Ghanaian children.\n\nSolidarity messages were delivered by representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, the Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Gender, and development partners, all reaffirming their commitment to supporting implementation of the policy.\n\nA highlight of the ceremony was a symbolic performance by the Early Childhood Development Council, creatively illustrating the critical stages of child growth and the shared responsibility of families, institutions and communities in nurturing children.\n\nThe launch of the revised ECCD Policy signals a renewed national resolve to build resilient systems that guarantee every Ghanaian child a healthy, safe and inclusive start in life, securing tomorrow by investing in children today.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Findings from the PwC Africa Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey indicate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will transform 49 per cent of jobs in Africa within three years.\n\nThe survey also reveals that whilst AI introduces uncertainty, 64% of African workers feel confident in their job security. 49,843 workers were surveyed in 48 countries across 28 sectors.\n\nIn the presentation of the key findings at the Mövenpick Hotel in Accra by Associate Director, Workforce Transformation, PwC Ghana, David Tsey, it was revealed that overall, AI use is strong. 64 % of African workers used AI at work in the past year, above the 54% global average. It also indicated that only 17% used AI daily.\n\nMr Tsey indicated that there is significant excitement and curiosity across Africa regarding the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nAccording to him, many employees are optimistic about how AI will transform the workplace. He explained that there is “a lot of excitement, a lot of curiosity, and a lot of positive feeling” about the impact AI will have on work.\n\nMeanwhile, the CEO of the Fair Wages and Salaries Commission, George Smith-Graham, emphasised that Ghana has reached a stage where AI is being adopted to enhance productivity within the public service.\n\nHe noted that if productivity improvements are not achieved through AI, the country risks paying employees who are not working as effectively as expected.\n\nDr. Smith-Graham further stressed that salary increases should no longer be automatic but must be directly linked to measurable productivity.\n\nAccording to him, Ghana has moved beyond the point where employees can simply demand salary increments without demonstrating improved performance. Instead, compensation growth must now be tied to increased efficiency and output, supported by AI adoption.\n\nHe said, “But what I take for me is that we've gotten to a stage where we are not going to just allow employees coming and just asking for salary increases. But we need to make sure that the increases are linked to productivity”\n\nThe survey also reveals that whilst AI introduces uncertainty, 64% of African workers feel confident in their job security.\n\nThe Forum debated how employers can proactively manage employee fears by investing in reskilling and upskilling programmes that enable workforce transformation without denting trust.\n\nWorkforce Transformation Africa Leader at PwC South Africa, Dr Dayalan Govender, advised leaders to understand their organisation.\n\nHe said, “What makes your employees tick? Next thing is, you get those millennials, or you get this Gen Z coming to your business. You know what they like? They like flexibility in terms of how they work. It's more output-driven. But we want to see your output.\"\n\nA Partner, Consulting and Risk Services at PwC Ghana, Winfred King, said leaders must be prepared to lead the change.\n\nHe outlined how leaders can effectively integrate upskilling, technology-driven transformation and human-centred approaches to build sustainable performance and ensure well-being across Africa’s diverse workforce.\n\nThe PwC Africa Workforce Hopes and Fears Survey Forum brought together leading voices from industry, academia, government and policy to explore how Africa can rewire the future of work in ways that deliver sustainable performance and build lasting trust at a time when Artificial intelligence and rapid technological acceleration are rewiring workplaces across Africa.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "An associate professor at the Department of Physics of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Professor Bright Kwakye-Awuah is raising scientific and cost concerns over the Environmental Protection Authority’s (EPA) technology to clean water bodies polluted by illegal mining activities.\n\nThe EPA on February 24, 2026, commenced a pilot application of the Copper-based nano liquid technology on the Birim River in the Eastern region.\n\nAfter days of the clean-up trial, the EPA released images of what appears to be a visibly clear state of the diverted and stagnant pool of the Birim River.\n\nBut a section of the public and local scientists critiqued the technology, with some doubting the feasibility of the trial in fighting the illegal mining menace.\n\nProfessor Bright Kwakye-Awuah, in the underlisted concerns, analyses the scientific and economic underpinnings of the technology while proffering viable solutions to restoring the polluted water bodies.\n\nIn his submission, Prof. Kwakye-Awuah explained that the scientific validity of the technology for polluted rivers, highlighting that the technology exhibits established antimicrobial and catalytic characteristics when applied under controlled parameters to facilitate flocculation – aggregation of dispersed particles to form larger clusters - or induce oxidative destabilisation of suspended particles.\n\nHowever, he believes rivers polluted by galamsey are multifaceted, involving extreme turbidity from clay and silt, a spectrum of dissolved and particulate heavy metals (including mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and manganese), potential cyanide residues, high suspended solids, and disrupted hydrodynamics.\n\nWith copper itself being a heavy metal, and introducing copper nanoparticles into an open river system, he says, raises significant concerns regarding secondary contamination, bioaccumulation in aquatic life, sediment enrichment with copper, and long-term ecological risks.\n\n“While rapid water clarification may be observed, visual improvements do not equate to compliance with regulatory standards for dissolved heavy metals. The dynamic nature of river systems means nanoparticles may disperse downstream, accumulate in sediments, or become resuspended during flooding events,” he added.\n\nPro. Kwakye-Awuah elaborated that any of such intervention would require robust validation, including ICP-MS analysis of residual metals, total copper quantification, sediment and ecotoxicity studies, before they can be deemed scientifically sound.\n\n“Without comprehensive chemical and ecological assessments, the approach may yield superficial results rather than true environmental remediation,” he noted.\n\nWith the EPA estimating that $200,000 is needed per kilometre of the river for cleaning, Prof. Kwakye-Awuah suggests the real means to stop the pollution is to fight off the illegal miners.\n\n“This assumes homogenous contamination, uniform effectiveness, and a one-off treatment capable of resolving pollution permanently. However, if illegal mining persists upstream, continuous or repeated applications would be necessary, causing total costs to escalate well beyond initial projections.\n\nHe continued that: “A thorough economic evaluation should consider treatment durability, reapplication frequency, long-term environmental liabilities, ongoing monitoring, and sediment management. Addressing symptoms in the river, rather than eliminating pollution at its source, risks creating a cycle of recurring public expenditure without sustainable outcomes. Cost justification must therefore be grounded in long-term effectiveness and risk of recurrence, not solely on immediate visual results”.\n\nHe recommended some possible technology-based solutions to clean the river, other than the experimental copper-based nano liquid technology.\n\n“Treating river segments with chemical nano-dosing primarily addresses downstream symptoms, whereas source-based interventions target pollution at entry points prior to dispersion,” he noted.\n\nProf Kwakye-Awuah asserts that treatment technologies must aim at physically removing suspended solids and adsorption of dissolved heavy metals without introducing additional toxicants.\n\n“Modular deployment at pollution nodes, coupled with water recycling for operational reuse, creates a closed-loop system that minimises river discharge,” he added.\n\nHe continued that: “When enforced alongside the cessation of in-stream mining and a polluter-pays model (requiring miners to fund water treatment) the economic burden shifts from the public to those responsible for contamination”.\n\nBy focusing on discharge points rather than the entire river, he says, the treated volumes decrease, capital and operational costs are more manageable, and long-term sustainability is enhanced.\n\n“Over time, source containment with engineered adsorption and flotation proves more structurally and economically viable than ongoing, river-wide chemical dosing, particularly when ongoing contamination is anticipated,” he noted.\n\nIn conclusion, Prof Kwakye-Awuah believes restoring the degraded water bodies or any other natural resource must not introduce harmful measures.\n\n“Environmental restoration must not introduce new environmental hazards. Rivers are dynamic, living ecosystems whose water chemistry and/or biochemistry are different from non-laboratory systems. The deployment of copper nanoparticles in natural water bodies, absent comprehensive ecotoxicological validation, poses potential long-term risks,” he noted.\n\nHe continued that: “Effective remediation begins at the source of contamination. By intercepting pollution from illegal mining, treating it with advanced adsorption and flotation systems, and responsibly reusing treated water, we can safeguard our rivers without imposing further chemical burdens. Ghana must prioritise science-based, economically sound, and ecologically responsible solutions to ensure the preservation of our rivers for future generations.”.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "When Ghana’s Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategy received cabinet approval in February 2026, it signalled the culmination of years of consultation and institutional leadership, with the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi (KNUST) at the centre of the national effort.\n\nFrom early ethical debates in 2022 to high-level national consultations in 2025, KNUST’s Responsible AI Lab (RAIL) shaped the ideas, frameworks and stakeholder engagements that ultimately defined Ghana’s AI roadmap.\n\nLaying the ethical foundation (2022)\n\nThe journey began in March 2022, when the Responsible Artificial Intelligence Lab (RAIL), a lab under the AI4D Multidisciplinary Labs project initiated by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) convened experts in digital technology, data governance and policy to deliberate on the ethical foundations of AI in Ghana.\n\nAt the time, Professor Jerry John Kponyo, Principal Investigator and Scientific Director of RAIL, presented a sobering assessment of Ghana’s AI landscape. He cited gaps in data infrastructure, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, shortage of skilled personnel, high implementation costs and the absence of a clear national AI strategy.\n\nHe recommended the establishment of a National AI Advisory Expert Group, a formal strategy framework and an oversight implementation committee.\n\n“We must be strategic as a nation and lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution in the sub-region,” he emphasised.\n\nThe workshop, which drew participants from government, civil society and international bodies including UNESCO and the UN Executive Office of the Secretary-General, framed AI not merely as a technological tool but as a governance and development issue rooted in Ghanaian values and societal norms.\n\nFrom ethical debate to national blueprint (April 2025)\n\nBy April 2025, those early recommendations had evolved into a structured draft National AI Strategy, with KNUST’s RAIL leading its coordination in collaboration with the Ministry of Communication, Digital Technology and Innovations and the British High Commission.\n\nAt a high-level consultation in East Legon, Prof. Kponyo presented the draft strategy anchored on eight key pillars designed to ensure ethical, inclusive and transformative AI adoption across healthcare, education, governance and agriculture.\n\n“We consider this a sacred duty,” he stated. “KNUST is fully committed to engaging all stakeholders and ensuring the strategy is adopted on schedule.”\n\nThe Minister for Communication, Digital Technology and Innovations, Samuel Nartey George, declared AI a national development priority.\n\n“Data alone isn’t enough, it’s the intelligence we apply that will revolutionise healthcare, smart cities, and financial inclusion,” he said, announcing the launch of the 1 Million Coders Programme to equip Ghanaian youth with future-ready skills.\n\nInternational partners echoed their support. Keith McMahon, Deputy British High Commissioner to Ghana, said: “Globally, we are behind in AI adoption, but today’s discussions give me hope that Ghana recognises its transformative potential.”\n\nDeepening academic ownership in Kumasi\n\nOn April 23, 2025, KNUST hosted the second national consultation in Kumasi, broadening engagement to academia and development partners.\n\nThe consultation moved beyond vision to implementation. Prof. Kponyo proposed an “AI-ready Ghana” programme, expanded AI education and training, stronger cloud partnerships and improved national data infrastructure. He also announced plans to establish a Responsible AI Office to oversee implementation and ensure ethical compliance.\n\nKNUST Vice-Chancellor, Rita Akosua Dickson, underscored the university’s institutional commitment.\n\n“This consultation brings together the brightest minds and critical stakeholders to chart a strategy that is all-inclusive, forward-thinking, responsible and grounded in Ghana’s unique developmental context,” she said.\n\nShe also announced an “AI in Education” Summer School scheduled for October 2025, aimed at building a competent AI workforce and strengthening national capacity.\n\nDr. Arnold Karvaapuo of the Data Protection Commission described the strategy as “a blueprint for Ghana’s digital future,” while Mr. Elikplim Sabblah of GIZ’s FAIR Forward initiative shared lessons from Rwanda and Kenya to inform Ghana’s approach.\n\nEngaging the Judiciary\n\nIn late April 2025, RAIL led a third consultation focused on Ghana’s judiciary, recognising that AI governance required constitutional and legal clarity.\n\nRepresentatives from the Ghana Bar Association cautioned against unregulated deployment, warning of risks including algorithmic bias, misinformation and threats to judicial integrity.\n\n“AI must not be rolled out without regulation. We need constitutional fidelity, democratic oversight, and a commitment to investing in local datasets,” a Bar representative noted.\n\nDiscussions emphasised human oversight in high-risk AI decisions, the need for a Ghana AI Institute, a national data strategy, infrastructure investment and gender inclusion.\n\nAs Ghana embarks on implementing its AI roadmap, the road to approval tells a deeper story: that national digital transformation can be rooted in local expertise, institutional leadership and a commitment to responsible innovation.\n\nIn that story, KNUST helped design Ghana's AI future.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Akenten Appiah-Menka University of Skills Training and Entrepreneurial Development (AAMUSTED) is appealing to the government to urgently address the infrastructure deficit and electricity challenges affecting academic work on campus.\n\nAccording to President of the Students’ Representative Council (SRC) at Mampong Campus, Yusif Watara Drago, lecture halls and other facilities are inadequate to accommodate the rising student population, making teaching and learning increasingly difficult.\n\nHe stressed that the situation requires immediate government intervention to expand infrastructure and improve academic delivery.\n\n“Our lecture halls are insufficient to accommodate the increasing number of students on the Mampong Campus. This is seriously affecting effective teaching and learning.\n\n“We are appealing to the government to support us with more infrastructure to boost academic work and improve conditions on campus,” he said.\n\nYusif Watara Drago explained that the university relies heavily on the national electricity grid, which has been fluctuating. Although the campus has a generator, he noted that it is not powerful enough to supply electricity to the entire university.\n\nHe therefore appealed to old students, corporate bodies and other stakeholders to support the institution with solar energy systems to help address the energy crisis and ensure smooth academic activities.\n\n“The university depends on the national electricity grid, and whenever there is a power outage, evening and night lectures are disrupted. Although we have a generator, it is not sufficient to power the entire university.”\n\n“We are calling on old students, corporate bodies and other stakeholders to support us with solar panels to help solve the energy crisis on campus.”\n\nThe SRC President further indicated that AAMUSTED Mampong Campus is the only university in the Asante Mampong Municipality, yet its football pitch is in a deplorable state. He said the poor condition of the pitch makes it difficult for students to adequately prepare for national competitions.\n\nHe appealed to authorities, including the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), and other football stakeholders to assist the university with an AstroTurf facility.\n\nHe made these remarks during the 2025/2026 Academic Year Matriculation Ceremony held at the Mampong Campus.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vice-Chancellor of AAMUSTED, Professor Frederick Kwaku Sarfo, assured students that the university remains committed to equipping them with industry-relevant skills and entrepreneurial training as part of its academic package.\n\n\"The university is committed to equipping students with industry-relevant skills and entrepreneurial training to prepare them for the job market.”\n\nHe stated that the Academic Affairs Directorate will compile the necessary data to facilitate payments under the government’s flagship No-Fees-Stress Scholarship Programme for first-year students.\n\nProfessor Sarfo also outlined available sources of financial assistance for students facing challenges, including support from the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETFund), the Ghana Scholarships Secretariat, Ghana Gas, and the Students Loan Trust Fund, among other funding agencies.\n\nHe added that the university has enhanced internet access through improved Wi-Fi connectivity to support teaching, learning and research.\n\nThe institution has also provided art tools, equipment, workshops and laboratory facilities to strengthen practical training and skills development.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor advised students to take their academic work seriously, protect the AAMUSTED brand and project an image that reflects excellence, integrity and professionalism.\n\n“Students must take their academics seriously and protect the brand of AAMUSTED by demonstrating excellence, integrity and professionalism,\" he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Because the property was reserved for official use, it fell under US jurisdiction, allowing American authorities to prosecute the case.\n\nReports say the two victims, who were aged 13 and 15 when the abuse began, came from a vulnerable background. Prosecutors said Mara exploited their circumstances over the course of about a year.\n\n\"His crimes were reprehensible. While no sentence could undo the harm he caused, today's outcome demonstrates that those who abuse children – domestically or abroad – will face significant consequences in the American justice system,'' said Assistant Attorney General A Tysen Duva.\n\nHe used the girls' mother's life-threatening illness as an opportunity to demand sex, telling them he could not help them without receiving something in return, said the Office of Public Affairs.\n\nMara had provided the girls with phones so he could summon them while his wife was away at work, it added.\n\nHe was also convicted of sending sexually explicit messages to one of the girls and attempting to persuade a housekeeper to mislead investigators.\n\nThe case was investigated by the US authorities with assistance from Burkina Faso.\n\n\"Our message is clear, those who prey on our children will pay a hefty price,\" said US attorney Kelly Hayes for the District of Maryland.\n\nIn statements issued after sentencing, US officials said the life term reflected the seriousness of the crimes and underscored the government's commitment to prosecuting child sexual abuse, including offences committed abroad by American citizens.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

It reportedly skidded off the runway and hit nearby vehicles.\n\nThe defence ministry later confirmed its C-130 Hercules was involved and that it had been transporting banknotes to the Central Bank of Bolivia. There were eight people aboard the plane, the air force commander said.\n\nPolice fired tear gas to disperse crowds allegedly trying to take the scattered banknotes.\n\nFirefighters had given an earlier death toll of at least 15.\n\nVideo footage showed the plane on the ground and badly damaged vehicles. In other videos, people could be seen running away from the tear gas and police officers, some holding shields, forming a line. Some in the crowds are seen throwing rocks.\n\n\"While news crews were covering the accident, individuals attempting to steal the transported money attacked the press with unusual violence,\" the National Association of Journalists of Bolivia said in a statement.\n\nIt said a mobile TV unit was \"directly targeted\", while other journalists \"were attacked with stones, suffering serious injuries while carrying out their work\".\n\nThe government-run Bolivian News Agency reported that at least a dozen people were arrested for stealing banknotes.\n\nBolivian banknotes were seen scattered at the crash site\n\n\"I want to make it clear to those who are trying to take money from the plane involved in this tragedy that this money has no legal value since it has not been issued by the Central Bank and does not have a serial number, and that attempting to use this money is a crime,\" the Minister of Defence, Marcelo Salinas, said.\n\n\"We also ask all those who are engaging in acts of vandalism in this area to refrain from doing so and to respect the mourning and grief we are experiencing at this difficult time.\"\n\nBolivia's Air Force commander Sergio Lora confirmed there were eight crew members on board the plane \"including cargo personnel and flight crew\".\n\nBolivia's health ministry said 31 people were injured in the incident. It also issued an urgent appeal for blood donations.\n\nEl Alto International Airport was temporarily closed following the crash.\n\n\"My sister told me that she was in the car when the plane crashed. The plane's tire fell on the car, and my sister was injured because the impact of the tire hit her on the head, so we rushed her to the hospital,\" a man told the Reuters news agency.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what caused the crash, but some witnesses said the weather at the time was treacherous.\n\n\"A heavy hailstorm\" was falling and \"there was lightning\" when the plane went down,\" a woman whose car was struck by the aircraft wreckage told the AFP news agency.\n\nAn investigation into the incident is under way.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Partial relief is expected within one to two weeks as works around Berth 14 are finalised.\n\n\n\nOfosu-Adjare, addressing the gathering, emphasised that port inefficiencies directly increase production costs, which can translate into higher cement prices.\n\n\n\n“If we want good prices, we must also perform our part of the bargain to ensure that production costs remain efficient,” she said.\n\n\n\nKofi Nsiah-Poku, President of the Association of Ghana Industries, praised the Ministers’ proactive approach but cautioned that until dredging and interim measures fully take effect, continued congestion could place pressure on cement costs for consumers."

            "content": "Business News of Saturday, 28 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nFormer Head of Public Affairs at Cocobod, Fiifi Boafo, has rejected President John Dramani Mahama’s assertion that the current cocoa producer price represents the best outcome for Ghana.\n\n\n\nAddressing Parliament in his 2026 State of the Nation Address, Mahama announced that the cocoa producer price, which has been adjusted downward to GHC41,392 per tonne, equivalent to GHC2,587 per bag, for the rest of the 2025/2026 crop season, is the best for Ghana.\n\n\n\nThe president explained that severe liquidity constraints within the cocoa sector made the revision necessary, noting that maintaining the previous price would have compelled the government to secure billions of cedis in additional borrowing, a move he warned could undermine recent gains in restoring fiscal stability.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to Ghanaweb's Western Regional Correspondent, Thomas Tetteh, in a reaction to the President’s remarks during the recent State of the Nation Address, Fiifi Boafo argued that the reduction in the cocoa producer price cannot be justified as beneficial to farmers.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the cocoa season, farmers were reportedly assured of a minimum guaranteed price of GH¢3,625 per bag. However, the government later announced a revised producer price of GH¢2,587per bag.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiifi described the reduction, nearly 30 percent as a significant setback for farmers who had already invested in farm maintenance, inputs and labour based on the earlier projected figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe questioned how a farmer who prepared his farm expecting GH¢3,625 per bag could remain motivated after receiving GH¢2,587 instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n“After making that investment, after preparing the farms, buying farm inputs and paying farm hands, you now pay the farmer GH¢2,500. How does that motivate the farmer?” he questioned.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has explained that the price adjustment was necessitated by falling global cocoa prices. At the time the Finance Minister announced the revised rate, international market prices had declined from earlier highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Fiifi Boafo criticised the approach, arguing that cocoa pricing should not be based solely on prevailing or spot market prices at the time of announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe maintained that authorities should rely on weighted averages and forward contracts when fixing producer prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the failure to sell cocoa when global prices were higher contributed to the current shortfall, and farmers are now bearing the cost of that decision.\n\n\n\n\"We are here because the government decided to sell at the wrong time, allowed the market to fall, and then decided to sell at a lower price,” he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate also highlights the financial challenges facing the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD).\n\n\n\nEstimates indicate that the Board requires about GH¢2 billion to purchase additional cocoa at the new rate, while outstanding arrears to farmers reportedly exceed GH¢11 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough cost-saving measures, including salary adjustments, are projected to save about GH¢40 million, Fiifi Boafo argued that such measures are insufficient compared to the scale of the financial gap.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stressed that the focus should not be partisan but centred on the welfare of cocoa farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his view, any measure that does not restore the originally expected GH¢3,625 per bag fails to address the core concern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether it is NPP or NDC, the farmer is losing, and any solution that does not restore the farmer to the initially expected GH¢3,625 per bag fails to address the core problem\", he stated"

Ask why Inaki’s junior brother [Nico] is playing for Spain and not Ghana.”\n\n\n\nOn timing, Afriyie believes it should be left to the players and the coach.\n\n\n\n“At any point in time, if the player feels that this is the time to play for Ghana, why not? If the coach thinks that Nketiah and Hudson-Odoi both born in England to Ghanaian parents but previously represented England merit a place in the Black Stars and they can help win matches, why not? Who decides who a Black Stars player is or who should be called?” he added."

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The US and Israel on Saturday launched an attack on Iran. Tehran has responded by launching missiles at Israel and in the Middle East where US forces operate.\n\nThe United States and Israel on Saturday launched an attack on Iran, with explosions seen across Tehran and in multiple cities across the country. Tehran has responded by launching waves of missiles and drones at Israel and towards several military bases in the Middle East where US forces operate.\n\nIran had previously warned that if it were attacked, it would respond by targeting US military facilities across the region. “This operation will continue relentlessly until the enemy is decisively defeated,” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said. All US assets throughout the region are considered legitimate targets for Iran’s army, it added.\n\nDetails of casualties and damage are still being collected.\n\nUS and Israeli attacks on Iran\n\nAt about 9:27am (06:27 GMT), Iran’s semi-official Fars news agency reported a series of explosions in the capital, Tehran.\n\nAl Jazeera’s correspondent in western Tehran said he heard two explosions, while videos shared on social media showed smoke rising from several parts of the city.\n\nTehran\n\nMissiles struck several areas of Tehran, including districts where key government ministries and military compounds are located.\n\nIranian media reported strikes on the Ministry of Intelligence, the Ministry of Defence, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Parchin military complex.\n\nSeveral missiles also hit University Street and the Jomhouri area of the capital, according to the Fars News Agency. Mehr News Agency reported that at least two students were killed in an attack on a school east of the capital.\n\n\n\nIran’s National Security Council has advised residents to leave Tehran amid fears of further escalation.\n\nMinab\n\nIn the southern city of Minab, an Israeli strike hit an elementary girls’ school, killing at least 51 people, state media reported.\n\nIsfahan\n\nWhile it is not yet clear what was hit, the central city of Isfahan was previously targeted in strikes in 2025 by the US and Israel, when military and nuclear-linked facilities in the area were attacked.\n\nIsfahan is considered a key hub for Iran’s ballistic missile programme, with production plants and research facilities in and around the city.\n\nOther locations that were struck include: Kermanshah, Qom, Tabriz, Ilam, Karaj, Lorestan province, Zanjan, Urmia, Bushehr, Damavand, and Shiraz.\n\nThese locations are shown in the map below. Al Jazeera will update it as more information becomes available.\n\nIranian attacks on Israel and US targets in the Gulf\n\nAt their closest points, Israel and Iran are less than 1,000km (620 miles) apart. The distance from Tel-Aviv to Iran’s capital, Tehran, is about 1,600km (1,000 miles).\n\nIran has retaliated by attacking US bases across the Middle East. Most of these attacks have been intercepted.\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael has declared a “special state of emergency”. Multiple explosions were reported in the skies above northern and central parts of Israel, including in the Tel Aviv area and Haifa, where sirens have been sounding continuously.\n\nThe Israeli army said it was intercepting a new wave of Iranian missiles, prompting people to shelter in bunkers.\n\nA nine-storey building was hit in northern Israel after Iranian missiles had been intercepted, leaving one man with minor injuries after he was struck by shrapnel from interceptor missiles, according to Israel’s Channel 12 broadcaster.\n\nQatar\n\nSmoke was seen billowing from a residential area on the outskirts of the capital, caused by falling debris from an intercepted missile.\n\nSeveral interceptions were made: The Ministry of Defense says it “thwarted” several attacks on the country.\n\nUAE\n\nA Pakistani national was killed in the UAE after being struck by falling debris, according to the Ministry of Defence. The ministry says it has intercepted a wave of missiles.\n\nThere were also reports of explosions heard in Dubai, which might have been caused by the interceptions.\n\nBahrain\n\nBahrain says a missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet, which it hosts.\n\nKuwait\n\nKuwait’s Ministry of Defence says that Ali al-Salem Air Base came under attack by a number of ballistic missiles, all of which were intercepted by Kuwaiti air defence systems.\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nLoud explosions were heard in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, the AFP news agency reported. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement standing in solidarity with Qatar, Jordan, Bahrain, Kuwait and the UAE.\n\nIraq\n\nA drone attack reportedly attempted to target Erbil International Airport, but air defences intercepted it.\n\nJordan\n\nMissiles have been intercepted over Amman, and flaming debris fell near a house. There were no reported injuries.\n\nUS military presence in the Middle East\n\nThe US has operated military bases in the Middle East for decades.\n\nAccording to the Council on Foreign Relations, the US operates a broad network of military sites, both permanent and temporary, across at least 19 locations in the region.\n\nOf these, eight are permanent bases, located across Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nAs of mid-2025, there are about 40,000 to 50,000 US soldiers in the Middle East, comprising personnel stationed in both large, permanent bases and smaller forward sites across the region.\n\nThe countries with the most US troops include Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia. These installations serve as critical hubs for air and naval operations, regional logistics, intelligence gathering and force projection.\n\nMajor US military buildup in the region\n\nThe US has amassed its largest military presence in the Middle East in decades.\n\nThis historic buildup features two carrier strike groups: the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea and the USS Gerald R Ford off Israel’s coast, supported by more than 150 aircraft and dozens of warships.\n\nThe USS Abraham Lincoln is a 333-metre (1,092ft) long, nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that can carry approximately 80 to 90 aircraft, including F-35C Lightning II stealth fighters, F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, and E-2D Advanced Hawkeye early-warning planes.\n\nThe USS Gerald R Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was the same vessel that previously supported US military operations in Venezuela, including missions conducted under Operation Southern Spear.\n\nIran’s missile arsenal\n\nThe exact size of Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal is unclear, but it is widely considered one of the largest and most advanced in the region.\n\nIran has developed a range of ballistic and cruise missiles over the past three decades. The graphic below summarises some of Iran’s most prominent missiles and their ranges.\n\nHow ballistic missiles work and where they can reach\n\nBallistic missiles are long-range weapons designed to deliver conventional or nuclear warheads by following a ballistic, or curved, trajectory.\n\nLaunched using powerful rocket engines, these missiles shoot upwards into the upper atmosphere or even space, travelling at incredibly high speeds. Once their engines are cut off, the missile follows a predetermined path, re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere in a steep descent before striking its target.\n\nBallistic missiles travel at extremely high speeds, allowing them to travel thousands of kilometres (miles) in just minutes.\n\n\n\nThe speed at which they travel is measured in Mach, a unit equivalent to the speed of sound; for example, Mach 5 means five times the speed of sound.\n\nSome, usually shorter-range, ballistic missiles reach supersonic speeds (faster than Mach 1, or about 1,225 kilometres per hour or 761 miles per hour), while others, usually longer-range missiles, can travel at hypersonic speeds – greater than Mach 5 (6,125km/h or 3,806mph).\n\nWhat makes ballistic missiles especially dangerous is their combination of long range, high speed, and how difficult they are to intercept.\n\nTheir fast, high-flight path gives defence systems little time to react, and when they re-enter the atmosphere, they descend even faster, making interception even more difficult. Some missiles also deploy decoys or other countermeasures to trick radar and missile defences, making them harder to intercept.\n\nIsrael’s missile arsenal\n\nIsrael has an advanced missile arsenal, including long-range and nuclear-capable systems, developed with decades of support from the US. The graphic below highlights some of Israel’s most notable missiles along with their respective ranges.\n\nWhat are Israel’s air defence capabilities?\n\nThe Israeli air defence relies largely on what is known as the Iron Dome system, which is equipped with a radar that detects an incoming projectile, as well as its speed and direction.\n\nOther systems intercept medium- and long-range missiles. The David’s Sling intercepts missiles ranging between 40km (25 miles) and 300km (186 miles). The Arrow System intercepts missiles with a range of up to 2,400km (1,491 miles).\n\nIn addition, the US has two Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries deployed in Israel to bolster the country’s defences. The THAAD system is designed to intercept short-, medium- and intermediate-range ballistic missiles."

            "content": "The US and Israel declared regime change as their ultimate goal. That, however, would be difficult to achieve.\n\nEarlier today, the United States and Israel launched an attack against Iran, hitting targets across the country. In their televised speeches, US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made clear that they are after regime change, not military pressure to secure a deal.\n\nThe attack and Iran’s swift response underscore just how precarious the diplomacy has become. The outbreak of war followed mediators’ announcement of a significant “breakthrough” in negotiations, with talks set to resume next week. Clearly, diplomacy was never meant to succeed and was merely used to mask war plans.\n\nFrom the timing of the attack, it is apparent that Washington and Tel Aviv had already made up their minds weeks ago. Israeli media reported that the operation had been coordinated with Washington to come ahead of the Purim holiday, which commemorates the biblical story of the Jewish people being saved from mass killing in ancient Persia.\n\nWhile both Trump and Netanyahu are clearly after a “victory” declaration, whether they can actually achieve it is unclear.\n\nTargeting the Iranian leadership\n\nIsrael and the US have claimed to have focused on taking out civilian and military leadership and military installations. Perhaps the hope is that they can bring the war to a quick end.\n\nIsrael claimed that it had achieved “very high success” in eliminating Iran’s leadership, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian among those targeted. Photos have already emerged of a major strike on Khamenei’s secure compound. Israeli media have reported the killing of General Mohammad Pakpour, a commander in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Ali Shamkhani, adviser to the supreme leader, and Amir Nasirzadeh, Iran’s defence minister.\n\n\n\nIsrael is clearly trying to reassure its citizens that it has the capability of reaching deep into Iran’s top layer of leaders.\n\nBut there has been no confirmation of leadership deaths so far from Tehran. Iranian media have claimed that Khamenei and Pezeshkian are safe and has reported instead on an air strike on a girls’ school in the city of Minab, with a death toll of at least 80.\n\nUnlike the 12-day war last June, when Iran’s retaliation was slow and measured, this time around, the Iranian armed forces retaliated almost immediately. Ballistic missiles were fired at US bases in Iraq, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, as well as Israeli cities like Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Eilat.\n\nThe speed of Iran’s retaliation indicates that it had anticipated these attacks and had its retaliation plans ready. The question now is whether Iran can outlast US resolve, which faces both domestic and international pressure.\n\nDomestic dangers\n\nTrump launched the war on Iran amid little enthusiasm among Americans for another foreign conflict. A recent poll by YouGov and The Economist suggests that just 27 percent of the US public supports the US using military force against Iran. Another survey conducted by the University of Maryland registered even lower approval: 21 percent.\n\nThe war has significant domestic political ramifications for Trump. As the operation progresses, if Iran fails to surrender, the US president will be caught between getting bogged down in a protracted conflict by escalating, and being seen as weak if he backs down.\n\nAs the midterm elections approach, the war will become a litmus test for Trump’s presidency. If the conflict does not go as the president has envisioned, it could reflect poorly on the Republican Party in the polls. If the GOP loses control of Congress to the Democrats, it would prevent Trump from pursuing his political agenda. Democrats gaining control of Congress could pile more impeachment pressure on Trump.\n\nWhat is victory?\n\nNo analyst thinks this war will be short. Unlike the 12-day war, which resulted in a ceasefire, this conflict already looks broader and deeper. Iran’s readiness to retaliate across the region suggests it is willing to wage a long war rather than compromise.\n\nOne problem Washington and Tel Aviv are facing is how to keep the pressure on Tehran without creating uncontrollable instability in the region. The other problem they have is that they put regime change as their ultimate goal.\n\nIn his speech announcing the attack on Iran, the US president appeared to suggest that the US army would stick to an aerial campaign and would not deploy troops on the ground. He appeared to put the responsibility for toppling the Iranian government in the hands of the Iranian people, saying “the hour of your freedom is at hand” and calling on them to rebel.\n\n\n\nThis call comes two months after Iran witnessed unprecedented mass protests across the country. The Iranian authorities, however, launched a brutal campaign of repression, killing thousands. At the moment, a similar wave of mass protests seems unlikely. That legacy of repression weighs heavily on society, and Iran appears resilient.\n\nMeanwhile, leadership “decapitation strikes” by the US and Israel will likely continue, but even if successful, they would not produce regime change.\n\nEventually, Trump’s generals may advise that prolonged conflict is unsustainable, echoing the lessons of the 12-day war. For Trump, an unwinnable war would invite a familiar exit strategy: Declaring victory on Truth Social and shifting the narrative.\n\nThe challenge then would be how to negotiate a ceasefire. Having been misled twice by the smokescreen of negotiations, Tehran could use this double betrayal to harden its position. If the regime survives, it could exploit US desperation for renewed talks to extract concessions. In that sense, diplomacy’s collapse today may set the stage for Iran to negotiate from a position of strength tomorrow.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

            "content": "Israel has been on high alert since it launched a wave of joint attacks with the US against Iran.\n\nCommentators within Israel have described a sense of business as usual in the wake of the country’s joint attack with the United States against Iran.\n\n“It’s Saturday, so the streets are naturally quiet,” political analyst Ori Goldberg said from outside Tel Aviv, as he returned from his shelter for the second time.\n\n“I think, politically, there’s a sense of triumphalism, of having attacked an enemy regime. Not really because we’re greatly invested in the future of the Iranian people, but because, through the genocide on Gaza, we’ve devalued human life,” he said, referring to the Israeli attacks on the besieged territory since October 2023.\n\nReturning to shelters around the country is now the stuff of everyday life for most Israelis, he said.\n\nIsrael has been on high alert since it launched a wave of attacks on Iran, the country that its leaders have consistently portrayed as its nemesis for decades.\n\nAnnouncing the attack through a video post on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu framed the attack in characteristically apocalyptic terms, saying Israel and the US had launched attacks to “remove the existential threat posed [to Israel] by the terror regime in Iran”, and going on to call upon the Iranian people to rise against their own leaders in response to the US and Israeli unprovoked strikes upon their cities.\n\nIran has retaliated with its own waves of missiles and drones against Israel and US assets in the region. At least one person was reported wounded in northern Israel.\n\nBut the latest strikes against Iran were met warmly by Israel’s political elite.\n\n\n\n“I want to remind us all: The people of Israel are strong. The IDF [Israeli army] and the Air Force are strong. The strongest power in the world stands with us,” opposition leader Yair Lapid wrote on social media, referring to the US.\n\n“In moments like these we stand together – and we win together. There is no coalition and no opposition, only one people and one IDF, with all of us behind them.”\n\nIn a subsequent post written in Farsi, he echoed the prime minister’s calls for Iran to enact regime change from within, a longstanding Israeli policy.\n\n‘It’s crazy’\n\nAccounts of the relative calm in Israel stand in sharp contrast to previous escalations, when sources described panic and bulk buying before an anticipated Iranian response to the wave of strikes Israel launched against targets in Iran.\n\n“People here are well trained,” Aida Touma-Suleiman, a Palestinian member of the Israeli parliament representing the left-wing Hadash-Ta’al faction, which is almost alone in opposing the strikes, said from her apartment near Haifa, where she had just returned from her shelter.\n\n“This is what they’re saying all the time in the media: How well-trained and ready we are. It’s crazy. I don’t think any country in the world has experienced more war than we have, so this is what they mean by ‘trained’,” she said, referencing the wars on Iran, Lebanon, Yemen and Gaza that Israel has waged since the Hamas-led attack of October 2023.\n\nAs Touma-Suleiman spoke, she was interrupted by an alarm on her phone. “That’s not the alert. That’s a warning on my phone telling me there’s going to be an alert and then I’ll have to return to the shelter,” she explained, laughing drily. “You see what I mean about being well trained?”\n\nTexting from Israel, Ahron Bregman, a senior teaching fellow at the Department for War Studies at King’s College London, described the relative calm and almost relief felt by many within the country that the uncertainty over war with Iran was at an end.\n\n“Both Israel and the US are after the Iranian leadership. They hope to weaken it substantially, though I doubt they could topple it from the air,” he said, raising the possibility of a prolonged conflict.\n\nHowever, how ready Israel might be for a lengthy war, and to what degree that might be Israel’s choice, was far from certain, Touma-Suleiman said.\n\n“It will be the United States that determines how long the war will be. They’ll continue until they’ve achieved whatever it is they want,” she said.\n\n“I don’t think Israel is ready for that. People are exhausted. The army is exhausted. I don’t know if they even have the reserves to manage a long war, and this is what Netanyahu is willing to gamble with, just so he can say to the public before elections: ‘Here is at least one victory.'”"

            "content": "EU urges ‘maximum restraint’; mediator Oman warns US ‘not to get sucked in’ further into conflict.\n\nThe outbreak of conflict between Israel and the United States against Iran, triggered by joint US-Israeli strikes across Iran, has drawn frantic calls for calm as deep consternation spreads across globe.\n\nCriticism has mounted against Washington for taking part in the attacks while still engaged in nuclear negotiations with Tehran. Anger has also surfaced in Gulf states caught up in the conflict, as Iran launches retaliatory missile strikes against US military assets hosted on their soil.\n\nHere is a breakdown of how countries and institutions are responding:\n\nUnited States\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced that the US was engaged in a “major combat operation” aimed at “eliminating threats from the Iranian regime” on Saturday morning, as missiles hit numerous areas in Tehran and across the country. Trump pledged to raze Iran’s missile industry and destroy its navy, while urging the Iranian people to overthrow the government.\n\nIsrael\n\nA senior Israeli defence official told the Reuters news agency the joint US-Israeli attacks had been planned for months, with a specific date set weeks ago. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed the attacks aimed to remove an “existential threat” posed by Iran. He said the attacks would “create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands”.\n\nIran\n\nIran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Israel and the US of violating the United Nations charter with their attacks and pledged a harsh response, as the country waged retaliatory attacks on Israel as well as in several Gulf states that host US military assets, including Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait. “All American and Israeli assets and interests in the Middle East have become a legitimate target,” a senior Iranian official told Al Jazeera. “There are no red lines after this aggression.”\n\n\n\nHezbollah\n\nLebanon’s Hezbollah condemned the US-Israeli attacks as a “blatant violation of international law and the United Nations Charter”, saying it was an attempt to destabilise the region and force its people “to accept domination and occupation schemes”.\n\nIt declared solidarity with Iran and called on people in the region to “confront this aggressive plan and recognise its danger”.\n\nUnited Nations\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned the “military escalation” and called for an “immediate cessation of hostilities”.\n\n“The use of force by the United States and Israel against Iran, and the subsequent retaliation by Iran across the region, undermine international peace and security,” he said, warning of the risks of a wider regional conflict with “grave consequences for civilians and regional stability”.\n\nThe UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Saturday.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nEuropean ⁠Commission President ⁠Ursula von der Leyen and European Council ⁠President Antonio Costa called the conflict “greatly concerning” and urged all parties “to exercise maximum restraint, to protect civilians, ‌and to fully respect international law”.\n\nRed Cross\n\nMirjana Spoljaric, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, called on countries to respect the rules of war and urged them to find the political will to prevent “further death and destruction”. She warned that “a dangerous chain reaction” of military escalation was under way across the Middle East, “with potentially devastating consequences for civilians”.\n\nOman\n\nThe main mediator in ongoing US-Iran negotiations, Oman expressed dismay at the outbreak of violence. Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said the conflict would not serve US interests, nor the interests of global peace, and urged Washington “not to get sucked in” further.\n\nThe country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on “all parties to immediately cease military operations” and for “the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to impose a ceasefire”.\n\nGermany, France, the UK\n\nIn a joint statement, the prime ministers of the three countries said they “condemn Iranian attacks on countries in the region in the strongest terms” and remain committed “to regional stability and to the protection of civilian ⁠life.” They also said they ‌want a resumption of US-Iran negotiations.\n\nSeparately, French President Emmanuel Macron ⁠called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council, ⁠saying the conflict carries “serious consequences” for international peace and security. “The current escalation is dangerous for everyone. It must stop,” he said.\n\n\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in an address that UK forces “are active and British planes are in the sky today as part of coordinated regional defensive operations”.\n\n“Iran can end this now,” he said, calling on them to “give up their weapons programmes, and cease the appalling violence and repression against the Iranian people”.\n\nQatar\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly condemned Iran for firing missiles at Qatari territory, which is home to the Al Udeid Air Base that hosts US troops. The ministry called the attacks a flagrant violation of Qatar’s national sovereignty and a direct assault on its security. It added that Qatar reserves the right to respond, as per international law.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nThe Ministry of Defence condemned in the “strongest terms” Iran’s attacks on its territory, several of which it said its air defences intercepted. It called the attack “a dangerous escalation and a cowardly act that threatens the security and safety of civilians”, stressing that the UAE has the “full right” to respond.\n\nBahrain\n\nBahrain confirmed that an Iranian missile attack targeted the headquarters of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet that it hosts, and called the attack “treacherous”.\n\nKuwait\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the Iranian attack on its soil as a “flagrant violation” of international law and said it had the right to respond. It warned that any additional escalation would only deepen regional instability.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia condemned in the “strongest terms” the Iranian attacks on Gulf Arab states and warned of “dire consequences”.\n\nTurkiye\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on “all parties” to end the spiral of violence, which it stressed started with US-Israeli attacks on Iran. “The events that began with Israel and the US attacking Iran, and continued with Iran targeting third countries, are of a nature that risks the future of our region and global stability,” said the ministry.\n\nPakistan\n\nForeign Minister Ishaq Dar “strongly condemned the unwarranted attacks against Iran and called for an immediate halt to escalation through urgent resumption of diplomacy to achieve a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis”.\n\nRussia\n\nDmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, accused the US of having used its nuclear talks with Iran as a cover-up before military operations. The country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged the international community to swiftly deliver an objective assessment of what it called irresponsible ⁠actions that risk ⁠further destabilising the region.\n\nChina\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged “an immediate halt to military actions” and appealed for “the resumption of dialogue and negotiations” to maintain regional peace and stability. It stressed that “Iran’s national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity should be respected.”\n\nIndia\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs called on all parties to “exercise restraint” and “avoid escalation”. It said “dialogue and diplomacy should be pursued” and that “sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states must be respected.” The statement came several days after the country’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi travelled to Israel and hailed their “vital” partnership.\n\n\n\nUkraine\n\nThe ⁠Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Iran of being responsible for the chain of events leading to the conflict, including its crackdown on protests earlier this year. “The cause of the current ⁠events is precisely ⁠the violence and impunity of the Iranian regime, ⁠in particular the killings and ⁠repression of ⁠peaceful protesters, which have become particularly widespread in recent ‌months,” said the Foreign Ministry.\n\nNorway\n\nForeign Minister Espen Barth said the initial attack on Iran by Israel breached standards of international law. “The attack is ⁠described by Israel as a preventive strike, but ⁠it is not in line with international law,” said Barth. “Preventive attacks require an immediately imminent threat.”\n\nBelgium\n\nForeign Minister Maxime Prevot said the Iranian people “must not pay the price for their government’s choices. We deeply regret that diplomatic efforts could not lead earlier to a negotiated solution.”"

We just have to prepare in the best way to earn the right to win it, as I always said,” Arteta told reporters on Friday.\n\n“What you have done two weeks or two years ago is irrelevant because every game and every context is different, the ⁠players might change, the mood of the team might ⁠be different. We are prepared.”\n\nArteta praised Chelsea’s ability to react to the game under Rosenior, who is yet to lose a league game as Chelsea manager.\n\n“They can change throughout the game ⁠and they have a manager very comfortable doing that, so we are prepared for the possible scenarios we ⁠can face and then we will try ⁠to be better than them,” Arteta added.\n\n‘Let’s go game by game’\n\nAsked if Arsenal can become the first English club to win the quadruple – including the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and the Champions League – this ‌season, Arteta shrugged off the idea.\n\n“Has it been done? That is how difficult it is,” he said.\n\n“So let’s go game by game and try ‌to ‌earn the right to be there in the last stage of every competition, and then we will see what happens.”\n\nRosenior eyes extended stay to stabilise Chelsea\n\nAsked how he viewed his Chelsea future after a solid start featuring four wins from six league games before disappointing draws with Leeds and Burnley, Chelsea’s boss said patience was the key to success.\n\n“Sitting here in this chair, I want to be here for as long as possible,” Rosenior told reporters on Friday.\n\n“I want to be the guy – and not just me but the team, the staff, the ownership, sporting directors – I want to be a part of something really successful for a long time. That’s why I signed up for this challenge.\n\n“The reality of football is that what gives you time is being successful. You need to show your quality, not just in terms of the games, but every day.\n\n“Every day you need to be top with the players in terms of the way you develop them, the way you put your sessions on, the way you conduct your meetings.\n\n“I hope this is the end of the upheaval for this club. I hope I can be here for a very long time and bring the club the success it deserves.”\n\nHead-to-head\n\nThe two London clubs first locked horns in 1907 – when the Gunners were called Woolwich Arsenal – and they have now played each other 214 times.\n\nArsenal have won 87 of those encounters, while Chelsea have won 66, and 61 games have ended as draws.\n\n\n\nThe Gunners have dominated many of the more recent fixtures and are unbeaten against the Blues in eight Premier League games, and 10 in all competitions.\n\nEarlier this year, Arsenal beat Chelsea over two League Cup semifinal legs, winning 3-2 at Stamford Bridge and 1-0 at the Emirates.\n\nChelsea did manage to hold the Gunners to a 1-1 draw in their last league game back in November 2025.\n\nArsenal’s team news\n\nVersatile midfielder Mikel Merino could miss the rest of the season after undergoing surgery to address a stress fracture in his foot.\n\nDefender Ben White is a doubt after missing the north London derby with a knock.\n\nWinger Bukayo Saka hobbled off in the win over Tottenham but is expected to be declared fit to face Chelsea.\n\nKai Havertz could possibly be in line to face his former club, but Arsenal are keen not to rush his comeback from a hamstring injury.\n\nPredicted starting XI:\n\nRaya (goalkeeper); Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Hincapie; Zubimendi, Rice; Saka, Odegaard, Martinelli; Gyokeres\n\nChelsea’s team news\n\nJamie Gittens and Levi Colwill have both been ruled out with injuries, while Wesley Fofana will be suspended after receiving a red card against Burnley.\n\nEstevao and Marc Cucurella both missed the Burnley game with hamstring problems and remain doubtful for this match.\n\nMidfielder Dario Essugo is available again as he has recovered from injury.\n\nPredicted starting XI:\n\nSanchez (goalkeeper); James, Tosin, Chalobah, Gusto; Santos, Caicedo; Palmer, Fernandez, Neto; Joao Pedro"

            "content": "Here’s what we can tell you. If you’re thinking of picking up the Galaxy S26 Ultra at launch, putting in your preorder now isn’t a bad idea. It’s also a great time to pick up the midrange QuietComfort Headphones and what many of us at The Verge consider to be the game of 2024: Astro Bot. And who doesn’t want to save on a slick handheld vac?\n\nNow let’s get to it.\n\nIf you’re craving a little peace and quiet, Bose’s QuietComfort Headphones are currently on sale at Amazon in multiple colors for $199 ($150 off), which is the best price we’ve seen this year.\n\nThe standard QC Headphones are essentially a refresh of the last-gen QC45s with some new software tricks, including the ability to adjust noise cancellation levels and set custom listening modes. That being the case, you still get up to 24 hours of battery life, excellent comfort, and multipoint support, making it easy to switch between Bluetooth devices on the fly. They lack Bose’s immersive audio mode and the higher-quality Bluetooth found in the newer QC Ultras, though, as well as support for lossless audio over USB-C. Then again, that probably shouldn’t come as a surprise given they’re retailing for $250 less.\n\nAs we alluded to earlier, Samsung announced its Galaxy S26 lineup this week. There are already plenty of preorder deals to consider, but one of the best comes courtesy of Amazon, which is throwing in a $200 gift card alongside a free storage upgrade when you preorder the 512GB Galaxy S26 Ultra starting at $1,299.99. Other retailers are also running promos ahead of the phone’s March 11th release date, mind you, though they’re not as impressive; Best Buy is only providing a free storage upgrade, while Samsung is offering a mere $150 in credit.\n\nWhile the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus both feel like underwhelming, iterative updates, the 6.9-inch Galaxy S26 Ultra actually impressed our resident phone reviewer, Allison Johnson. That’s largely because of the new Privacy Display, which can help shield your screen from people sitting near you (if desired), and a more powerful camera array that should improve low-light performance. Plus, like the rest of the S26 lineup, the Ultra is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, which supports more advanced generative AI tools and a souped-up version of Gemini that can carry out certain tasks in third-party apps on your behalf. No one likes calling an Uber themselves, anyway.\n\nYou can still grab a physical copy of Astro Bot at Walmart for $32.99 ($27 off), an all-time low. The fantastic PlayStation 5 exclusive — which won Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards — has players take on the role of Astro, a lovable robot who sets off on a space adventure after his crew is lost in a sudden attack. Despite the prior game being a pack-in title for the PS5, Team Asobi’s full-sized sequel brims with inventive platforming, whimsical power-ups, and a kind of lighthearted fun that recalls the best of Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon. Thankfully, it never feels outdated, even if ‘90s vibes are totally there.\n\nIf you’re looking for a relatively compact handheld vacuum that can reach into car crevices and suck up crumbs on your desk, Fanttik’s foldable Fold V10 Apex is still on sale at Amazon for $85.49 (about $65 off), matching its best price to date.\n\nFanttik’s 17,000Pa vac features an extendable nozzle that pivots up to 210 degrees, along with a built-in LED light to help illuminate the dark corners of your vehicle. An onboard display, meanwhile, indicates the remaining battery life and suction mode, as well as the status of the washable filter. It also comes with a range of useful add-ons, including an upholstery tool, two brush heads, and an extendable hose with a crevice tool for hard-to-reach areas. It even charges via USB-C, making it easy to juice after the battery runs out in about 30 minutes or so.\n\nMore ways to save this weekend\n\nsecond-gen AirTags for $99.99 ($24 off) at You can pick up fivefor $99.99 ($24 off) at Costco , though non-members will have to pay a $5 surcharge. That’s the first discount we’ve seen on Apple’s latest location tracker, which builds upon its predecessor with an upgraded ultra-wideband chip and extended range, allowing for more precise tracking from up to 50 percent farther away. It’s also better at locating items in multi-story homes, and the built-in speaker is up to 50 percent louder, making it easier to hear.

The 1440p display is a great entry-level OLED, with a sharp 16:9 panel and a speedy 240Hz refresh rate. As a QD-OLED monitor, it delivers the deep blacks and vibrant colors the technology is known for, along with G-Sync compatibility to help reduce screen tearing. It also includes a three-year warranty for added peace of mind.\n\nSharge Pixel 100 from You can snag thefrom Amazon (with Prime) and Sharge for $69.90 ($30 off) right now, which is its lowest price to date. The small, retro-inspired GaN charger delivers up to 140W of power, which is enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50 percent in about 25 minutes. It also features three USB-C ports for powering multiple devices, along with a customizable dot-matrix display that shows the real-time wattage for each port."

On one end of the tracker you’ll find an integrated metal loop that can be attached to a keyring or clipped to a carabiner without the need for an extra case.\n\nThe Xiaomi Tag is compatible with both Apple’s Find My and Google’s Find Hub tracking networks and mobile apps, but not at the same time. You’ll need to choose one or the other during setup. Like Apple’s AirTag, the Xiaomi Tag is powered by a replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery good for up to a year of use, and boasts an IP67 dust and water resistance rating, so it can survive a short dunking. There are also NFC capabilities that others can use to load your contact details should they find a lost device with the tag attached.\n\nAlthough it doesn’t have a clip, the Xiaomi Tag has a metal loop on one end so you can attach it to other things without needing a case. Image: Xiaomi\n\nOne big differentiator is that unlike Apple’s AirTags, the Xiaomi Tag lacks ultra wideband (UWB) functionality for pinpointing its exact location. You’ll instead have to rely on audible alerts to locate it once you’re nearby. If that’s not a deal-breaker, the Xiaomi Tag will be a cheaper alternative to Apple’s AirTags, selling for £12.99 (around $18) each, or £44.99 (around $61) for a four-pack. A single second-gen AirTag is $29, or $99 for four."

He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nXiaomi and Leica’s long-running phone partnership just got a little closer. Alongside the new international release of its 17 Ultra flagship, Xiaomi has been entrusted with manufacturing a separate version that is the first Leica Leitzphone to release outside of Japan, following three Sharp-made models exclusive to the country.\n\nIn truth, the Leitzphone is a 17 Ultra with Leica branding and a rotatable camera ring, and apart from a few design tweaks, it’s mostly the same as the Leica Edition of that phone already available in China. But the branding is a big deal: Leica hasn’t let Xiaomi use its red dot logo on hardware until now, even though the companies have partnered on Xiaomi’s flagship cameras since 2022. The jump to a fully Leica-branded phone is a vote of confidence from the camera company.\n\nAfter two weeks using the Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra, it’s clear that confidence was well placed. This is my favorite phone of 2026 so far, Leica logo or not, though most buyers would be better off saving money with the standard 17 Ultra.\n\nThe 17 Ultra and its original Leica Edition launched in China on December 25th, 2025. The international version and the Leitzphone were launched at Xiaomi’s pre-MWC press conference in Barcelona on February 28th, alongside the regular Xiaomi 17. The 17 Ultra starts from £1,299 / €1,499 (about $1,750) with 512GB storage, rising by £400 / €700 for the Leica version. That’s a hefty premium, but there are a few differences from the regular 17 Ultra.\n\nLet’s start with the Leica of it all. It’s obvious first and foremost in the design: an ever-so-slightly glossy black finish on the back, an industrial touch in the knurled aluminum-alloy edges, and Leica’s red dot logo in one corner. It’s a slightly different design to the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that released in China at the end of December, which has a two-tone finish and orients the Leica logo the other way. It also ships with branded accessories, including a faux leather case with a Leica lens cap, a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a bright red wrist strap.\n\nThe Leica logo isn’t just printed on; that lettering is raised metal. The textured edges make the phone more grippy, even without a case. My favorite accessory by far is this case, which preserves the red dot logo and adds a lens cap.\n\nOther changes run through the software. While both versions of the 17 Ultra run Xiaomi’s HyperOS 3, based on Android 16, the Leitzphone’s interface has been customized. There are dedicated Leica widgets, including photo galleries and a golden-hour timer, and custom monochrome app icons for the most popular apps from Xiaomi and third parties — which look great when you first turn the phone on, but less so once they’re mixed in with all the non-monochromatic apps you’ll inevitably download from elsewhere.\n\nLeica and Xiaomi’s design languages coexist in the camera app.\n\nMost of the customization is in the camera. There’s an expanded array of Leica filters, and the interface uses Leica fonts and red as its accent color, instead of Xiaomi’s usual yellow. A new Leica Essential shooting mode lets you pick between two camera simulations: a color re-creation of the M9 and a monochromatic take on the M3. The Leitzphone also adds the option to enable C2PA content credentials on every shot you take.\n\nNone of this is as novel as the Leitzphone’s unique hardware feature: a rotatable camera ring. The edge of the camera island can be twisted round, with a satisfying haptic buzz to emulate the feel of gears clicking. It makes for an excellent fidget spinner, though its real purpose is to control zoom in the camera app, or cycle through exposure settings or filters if you prefer.\n\nThe metal rim of the camera island is the part that twists round.\n\nThis sounds like a great idea, and it’s something I’ve wanted to see on more phones since spotting it on Nubia’s Focus 2 Ultra. In practice, it’s not that useful. The camera island may be enormous by phone standards, but it would be small on a real camera, and it’s too flush against the body to hold comfortably. I’ve had to force myself to use the camera ring to zoom, finding the onscreen controls quicker and more natural every time. Perhaps with persistence I could drill it in my muscle memory; for now, I mostly rotate it by accident and get annoyed when I do.\n\nThe addition of the zoom ring makes sense given the 17 Ultra’s headline photography feature: a telephoto with continuous optical zoom. While Xiaomi’s 15 Ultra featured two telephoto cameras, the 17 Ultra combines them into one. (The company skipped 16 to catch up with Apple.) A single 1/1.4-inch type 200-megapixel sensor is paired with a Leica APO zoom lens that covers 3.2-4.3x magnification — the equivalent of 75-100mm — adjusting the aperture from f/2.39-2.96 as it goes.\n\nThe obvious criticism is the same we levied at Sony’s Xperia 1 IV, which boasted continuous 3.5-5.2x zoom: This is too short a spread to make much difference. It’s rare that the framing of a photo changes drastically as you move through the range, and outside those limits you’re back to the same digital zoom and sensor cropping that every other phone offers.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 20 I took all of these photos using the 17 Ultra’s telephoto camera.\n\nPhotos are excellent. The large sensor delivers natural bokeh, along with macro support at a minimum distance of 30cm. It can handle challenging lighting conditions, with good results in dim light — though it did once struggle with the inverse, blowing out highlights on an especially bright day. Mostly I’ve shot exclusively on the Leica Authentic mode — the other option being Leica Vibrant — which I like for its filmic qualities, preserving more of the highlights and shadows than most phones and avoiding the flattened sheen of excessive HDR.\n\nThe other lenses are just as impressive, though I do find myself defaulting to the telephoto. The main camera has a large 1-inch-type sensor, and the same 50-megapixel resolution as the ultrawide and selfie camera. It’s one of the first phones to include a LOFIC (lateral overflow integration capacitor) sensor, which expands the dynamic range for highlights, helping me take some of the most dramatic skyline shots I’ve managed on a phone, and contributing to excellent performance in nighttime shots with bright lights.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 14 These are a mix of photos from the other lenses.\n\nDespite the Leica logo, this isn’t just a camera. The Leitzphone has all of the flagship specs you’d expect: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, 16GB of RAM (in this economy?!) and 1TB of storage (with an option for 512GB on the regular 17 Ultra), a 6.9-inch 1-120Hz LTPO OLED display, and IP68 protection.\n\nThe battery is another standout feature. The 6,000mAh silicon-carbon cell isn’t the biggest around, and is smaller than the phone’s Chinese edition, but it’s still impressive. Even powering a demanding phone with a big display, I’ve usually been able to just about get two days of use from it between charges, though with very little left in the tank afterwards. 90W PPS wired charging and 50W wireless top it back up fast, though you’ll be limited to slow Qi speeds over third-party wireless chargers, and there’s no support for the magnetic Qi2 standard.\n\nThis is my favorite phone of the year so far.\n\nThe biggest problem the Leitzphone has is that it’s mostly a more expensive version of the 17 Ultra, which shares most of its best features. I prefer the look of the Leitzphone, and like a few of the Leica-specific shooting styles and the included case. But those aren’t worth £200, and the rotatable camera ring isn’t either. Unless that little red dot is very dear to your heart, there’s not quite enough reason to shell out extra for it — but mostly because the 17 Ultra is such a good phone in its own right.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nAgree to Continue: Xiaomi 17 Ultra Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it — contracts that no one actually reads.

The limited-edition Leitzphone will be substantially more expensive at £1,699 / €1,999 ($2,300), though it includes 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, along with a few extra accessories.\n\nI like the simple, sleek aesthetic of the phone. The 6.3-inch display isn’t tiny, but it does make the phone small by modern standards. All three of the phone’s rear cameras are 50-megapixel.\n\nThe 17 is an extremely capable small-ish flagship, with a 6.3-inch OLED display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, and large 6,330mAh silicon-carbon battery (though sadly smaller than the 7,000mAh version launched in China). I won’t be writing a full review of the 17, but did spend a week using it as my main phone, and found that the battery cruised past the full-day mark, though wasn’t quite enough for two full days of my typical usage. That’s far better battery life than you’d find in similarly sized phones from Apple, Samsung, or Google.\n\nThe cameras impress too, with 50-megapixel sensors behind each of the four lenses, selfie included. Pound for pound, you won’t find many better camera systems in any phone this size.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 I’ve been largely impressed by the Xiaomi 17’s cameras.\n\nThe Ultra, unsurprisingly, takes things to another level. It’s much larger, with a 6.9-inch display, and weighs a hefty 218g. Despite that, the 6,000mAh is actually smaller, though I found it delivered pretty similar longevity.\n\nThe 17 Ultra is larger in just about every respect, but strangely has a smaller battery.\n\nThe enormous camera is, as ever for Xiaomi’s Ultra phones, the highlight. There are 50-megapixel sensors for each of the main, ultrawide, and selfie cameras, with a large 1-inch-type sensor behind the primary lens. The periscope telephoto is even more impressive: 200-megapixel resolution, a large 1/1.4-inch sensor, and continuous optical zoom from 3.2x to 4.3x, the equivalent of 75-100mm. Xiaomi isn’t the first to pull off a true zoom phone — Sony’s Xperia 1 IV got there first in 2022 — but the telephoto camera here is far more capable than that phone’s, with natural bokeh and impressive performance even in low light.\n\nThis is the Leica-branded Leitzphone version of the 17 Ultra.\n\nThe camera capabilities are supported by Xiaomi’s ongoing photography partner Leica, but it’s the pair’s Leitzphone that really emphasizes that. Slightly redesigned from the 17 Ultra Leica Edition that was released in China last December, this includes Leica branding across the hardware and software, a range of Leica filters and shooting styles, and a rotatable rear camera ring that can be used to control the zoom. It’s the first Leica Leitzphone produced by Xiaomi — after a trio of Japan-only Sharp models — and comes with additional branded accessories, including a case with a lens cap and a microfiber cleaning cloth.\n\nXiaomi has plenty of other announcements alongside the 17 series phones at MWC this year, including a super-slim magnetic power bank, the Pad 8 and Pad 8 Pro tablets, and a smart tag that supports both Google and Apple’s tech-tracking networks.\n\nPhotography by Dominic Preston / The Verge"

            "content": "I never knew how easy it was to die in an orgy. But that’s just one of the many threats facing Geralt of Rivia in his latest adventure. The studio behind the Reigns series of Tinder-like choose-your-own-adventure games has now adapted The Witcher, following a handful of original titles and a take on Game of Thrones. And for Francois Alliot, creative director at Reigns studio Nerial, the series’ structure actually makes it an ideal way to ease players into sprawling fantasies like this. “There’s something about the way you can bring really complex universes, lore, and storylines to simple actions,” he says. “It can work in a lot of contexts.”\n\nWhat makes Reigns so approachable is the way it distills every action into a binary choice. As you play, you’re presented with cards, and you progress by either swiping right or left. In the case of The Witcher, for instance, an elf might ask Geralt for protection, and your options are simply to say either yes or no and then deal with the consequences. Each run through the game involves making a number of these decisions to progress a storyline until, well, you die.\n\nThe idea was for Reigns: The Witcher to work on two levels. For existing fans, it’s a fun way to play around and experiment in the world. “It’s not a new Witcher,” Alliot notes. “It’s a meta game around this universe, a bit like a fanfiction simulator.” But for those who might be intimidated by the franchise, which spans multiple books, games, and TV shows, it’s also a good place to start. “It works nicely as an entry point because you can really get a feel for the tone and rules, or lack of rules, of the world,” says narrative designer Oscar Harrington-Shaw. “But you’re not having to commit to a complex RPG.”\n\nThere are several aspects of the Reigns formula that had to be tweaked to work with The Witcher. One of the key conceits in the games is that you can die; in the original Reigns you played as a king, and when that was over you picked up as their successor. But that doesn’t really work when you’re playing a character like Geralt who can’t die. So you aren’t actually playing as Geralt; instead, you’re his bard pal Dandelion, singing tales of Geralt’s exploits that may or may not be true. This allowed the team at Nerial to “free ourselves from the lore,” as Alliot describes it, and have fun with things. This is especially apparent in the deaths, which come in the form of the aforementioned orgies or even from Geralt drinking himself to an early grave.\n\n“It really helped in two ways,” Harrington-Shaw says of coming up with the Dandelion idea, which came about from discussions with Witcher studio CD Projekt Red. “One is that it helps explain the loop; it gives a really neat end point. And we can have loads of fun deaths because it’s just a satisfying ending to a song. But we think it adds a really fun tension because you are playing as Geralt and you’re trying to survive, but you’re also trying to write good content.”\n\nImage: Devolver Digital\n\nAs I played, this setup made me much more open to experimenting. Instead of trying to roleplay as Geralt, I would often make odd choices just to see what happened. This, in turn, helps open up new storylines, giving some payoff for making the seemingly wrong decision. Even an early death can lead somewhere interesting in future runs.\n\nThe other notable addition in Reigns: The Witcher is a combat system. It wouldn’t be The Witcher if Geralt wasn’t slaying some monsters, but the idea of battles also had the potential to complicate the streamlined Reigns structure. The team settled on a sort of rhythm game, where you’re moving Geralt side to side on a board to attack or avoid monsters. What makes this system work within the confines of Reigns is that you’re still using the same commands; whether you’re making a pivotal decision or staring down a striga, everything comes down to swiping either right or left.\n\nDespite those changes, Harrington-Shaw says that The Witcher universe is an almost ideal fit for Reigns thanks to its dark sense of humor and frequently bleak world full of opposing factions. More important, though, is the main witcher himself. “Geralt is always facing these tricky binary choices,” he says. “The world of The Witcher is full of murky, gray morality, and that seemed perfect to translate.”\n\nReigns: The Witcher is out now on PC and mobile."

Previously, at Protocol, The Wall Street Journal, and Wired.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nHi, friends! Welcome to Installer No. 117, your guide to the best and Verge-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, please send Android tips, and also you can read all the old editions at the Installer homepage.)\n\nI also have for you the first big phone launch of the year, a new-old weather app, a way to maybe make your YouTube a little cheaper, a bunch of stuff to watch this weekend, and much more. Missed you last week! Let’s get back at it.\n\n(As always, the best part of Installer is your ideas and tips. What are you reading / watching / playing / listening to / turning up to 11 this week? Tell me everything: installer@theverge.com. And if you know someone else who might enjoy Installer, forward it to them and tell them to subscribe here.)\n\nThe Drop\n\nScreen share\n\nMeredith Haggerty is one of those people you meet and you’re immediately like, Oh, you’re much cooler than I am. The more I get to know Meredith, a new(ish) editor here at The Verge, the more I realize how correct my first assumption was. Meredith has written about fashion and culture and brands and TV shows and also recently made a Pride and Prejudice joke that made me laugh so hard I spilled coffee all over my keyboard. Technically, Meredith owes me a keyboard.\n\nI asked Meredith to share her homescreen with us, both because I think it’s a fun way to get to know new people here and because I want her to tell me about cool things but I don’t want to just constantly badger her for TV recs. Here’s her homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why:\n\nThe phone: An iPhone 17. Until very recently, I was clinging to an iPhone 12 mini that I’d gotten as a hand-me-down corporate gift from a friend; it was so tiny and good and I had the perfect phone case. (Ben Affleck smoking a cigarette in a mask. A conversation starter!) But the battery became glacial, even after a couple of trips to the Genius Bar, and I had to give it up.\n\nThe wallpaper: A screenshot of Roku City, fall edition. I find Roku City very calming, so I decided to keep it with me.\n\nThe apps: Spotify, Messages, Mail, Chrome.\n\nI’m especially dependent on Notes, and here you can see my three main categories of Note: things I need to do, things I need to buy, thoughts I probably would have tweeted a few years ago. I love that the MTA app will tell me when I should leave for the train, but I almost never check it before I leave my house. For the weather, I actually rely on the New York Metro Weather Instagram account; my boyfriend hates it when I tell him what number the vibes are.\n\nTo be clear, this attempt to simplify my homescreen hasn’t alleviated my time-wasting at all. Beyond this page, I have a loopy number of apps, mostly put into folders to keep me away from them, which doesn’t work. I’m still always scrolling to the last page, to the last folder, to the last page of that last folder, so I can play a mobile game I don’t enjoy called Drop the Cat. There’s maybe nothing worse in my life than the hold that mobile games I don’t enjoy have on me. I’m not even a cat person.\n\nI also asked Meredith to share a few things she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back:\n\nLove Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette . I’m appropriately ashamed of watching this show (I’m sorry, Schlossberg family!), but it’s a fantastic combination of cool and dumb. One second it makes smoking a cigarette in 1994 while wearing Calvin Klein look like the apex of human existence; the next, Fake JFK Jr. is pointing to an actor in a thick white wig, saying, “Have you met my uncle Teddy?” We shouldn’t even talk about the scene where Jackie O dances to Camelot.

It parses the deluge of recommendations from TikTok or Instagram, if you happen to be on the “wealthy children pose with food” side of those apps. You screenshot the clip, send it to Rodeo, and it grabs the relevant information and can save it in fairly handy lists.\n\nThe library. This might be stolen valor from the Meredith who had not yet downloaded Drop the Cat, but a little over a year ago I moved closer to the library and have really been cashing in on how free those books are. Plus, the Brooklyn Public Library app is so good, letting me put things on hold whenever I happen to think of them. I’m currently reading Louise Erdrich’s The Sentence , which I am probably incorrectly not as into as her The Mighty Red , and we don’t have to talk about how many times I’ve renewed it because I’ve been playing phone games instead.\n\nNirvanna the Band the Show the Movie . I’d never watched Viceland’s Nirvanna the Band the Show before I went to see the movie, and you currently cannot do so legally, so probably I still haven’t. I didn’t need it to enjoy the movie, though, which is hilarious and sweet and made me go “How did they do that???” so many times.\n\nCrowdsourced\n\nHere’s what the Installer community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email installer@theverge.com or message me on Signal — @davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week. For even more great recommendations, check out the replies to this post on Threads and this post on Bluesky.\n\n“Marathon (a new extraction shooter game by Bungie) is having an open play-test / demo this weekend so that’s what I’ll be into for the next few days.” – Janego\n\n“Really enjoying Agnes Aubert’s Mystical Cat Shelter by Heather Fawcett (author of the delightful Emily Wilde series). Feels like a cross between Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell and Howl’s Moving Castle.” — Spencer\n\n“Since 1Password have upped their price I’ve spent a few hours moving over to Apple Passwords and Uplock. Was mostly okay, but it’s a shame you can’t transfer over all your passkeys to Apple Passwords. Uplock having a lifetime purchase is a big plus.” — Matthew\n\n“Been watching Demon Slayer this past month, and FINALLY watched the Infinity Castle movie in a theater, and, it’s so clear how these anime movies are wildly different (and spectacular!) in tone, direction and characterization from our current crop of Hollywood blockbusters.” — Anshuman\n\n“I just yesterday switched my family from my grandfathered free Google Apps plan for our custom domain email to Fastmail. Fastmail is private but supports industry standard IMAP and CalDAV protocols, so we can use the built-in mail apps on our phones and computers.” — Mike\n\n“I’ve been listening to Comedy Bang Bang! Still super funny. Big Paul F. Tompkins fan.” — Mo\n\n“Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown. Despite the occasionally brutal RNG, it’s so fun to be able to dive into my favourite Trek stories and tweak the outcomes.” — Jono\n\n“Reading the first book in the On the Calculation of Volume series. It’s a time loop story, like Groundhog Day but way more realistic and sorta sad but it’s great so far!” — Colin\n\n“The news of the YouTube app coming to the Apple Vision Pro made me re-watch the only good use of 360 video I’ve seen: ‘How TV screens made watching movies worse,’ a fully 3D-animated, 20-minute video essay about how the home releases of movies differ from their theatrical cuts and why that matters, and how the physical size of TV screens makes an impact on content. If you have a Vision Pro it’s worth pulling out just for this video. After that, watch everything else that YouTuber (Noodle) has made.” — Nathan\n\nSigning off\n\nThis winter has been a disaster, where I live and many other places. So much snow, so many snow days, so much chaos. First of all, I hope you’ve all stayed safe and warm and well! Second of all, there is one bit of good news in all this: Casey Neistat is out in New York City vlogging again. All these years later, nobody YouTubes quite like Casey YouTubes. Between this and the return of Paul Ford’s blog, it almost feels like the good internet is coming back. Here’s hoping.\n\nSee you next week!"

He’s been a tech journalist for 20 years.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGood electric bikes are expensive. So why not buy one and share it?\n\nThat’s the idea behind the Tenways CGO Compact e-bike I’ve been sharing with my wife and teenage daughter for the last two weeks. It adapts in seconds without any tools to comfortably fit riders of varying heights thanks to its low-entry frame, quick-release seat post, and height-adjustable handlebar.\n\nIt also takes up less space than an ordinary bike with its 20-inch wheels, folding pedals, and a handlebar that twists to create a slim, wall-hugging profile that goes flat inside a car or train.\n\nThe CGO Compact’s geometry puts riders into a comfortable upright body position. Combine that with wide tires and a heavy aluminum frame – heavier than many full-sized e-bikes – and it feels remarkably sturdy despite its size, with a rear carrier system strong enough to hold a child or a few days of groceries.\n\nThe shareable e-bike isn’t a new idea, but Tenways comes close to perfecting it with the €1,999 (about $2,365) CGO Compact.\n\n9 Verge Score Tenways CGO Compact e-bike $ 2365 $ 2365 The Good Saddle and handlebar adjust quickly\n\nTwists and folds to go flat\n\nRides big and sturdy\n\nGood hauling capacity for size\n\nNo service upsells\n\nLow battery alerts The Bad App is just fine\n\nQuick release seat easy to steal $2365 at Tenways How we rate and review products\n\nTenways, the Amsterdam-HQ’d e-bike company of Chinese origin, has been on a tear in Europe thanks to the post-pandemic chaos that took out much of its competition. The brand makes great looking e-bikes from off-the-shelf parts supported by a robust service network. Importantly, they sell below the €2,681 (about $3,160) e-bike average — expensive compared to the US, but far less likely to burst into flames.\n\nMy Tenways review e-bike arrived at my front door in a giant cardboard box. It seemed big enough to fit the CGO Compact fully assembled and with the handlebar twisted, yet I still had to attach the steering column and front wheel myself. The e-bike took about 20 minutes to unbox, but I’ve been assembling direct-to-consumer e-bikes about once a month for the last decade.\n\nQuickly adjusts to fit my wife who is 164cm (5ft 5in) tall. The handlebars and shock-absorbing seat can be raised in seconds to fit my 183cm (6ft) frame. Open the release to raise and lower the handlebars, lift that little pin to twist them out of the way. The folding pedals help create a wall-hugging profile that’s easy to walk past.\n\nThe first thing I did after assembly was play with the Byschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem. It’s magical. Open the lever to quickly raise and lower the handlebar, or to gain access to a pin release that lets the handlebar twist out of the way. It took a little practice for everyone to master but we soon got the hang of it.\n\nThe small LCD dashboard is bright and colorful even in the sun. You have to enter a four-digit PIN code at power-on, which can only be changed in the rudimentary app over Bluetooth. It’s the only theft-deterrence Tenways offers on the CGO Compact, which also means it won’t try to upsell you on subscriptions or software-locked features.\n\nDespite our height differences, ranging from 164cm to 183cm (5ft 5in to 6 feet), everyone found the CGO Compact to be very comfortable. Adjusting the handlebar and saddle takes less than 10 seconds, and the suspension seatpost did a good job of soaking up small bumps. But the seat’s quick release mechanism offers no additional security to prevent the post and saddle from being stolen. A no-no in the big European cities this bike targets.\n\nThe e-bike’s torque sensor made the ride exceptionally intuitive, ensuring that the power delivered by the 250W rear-hub motor was tuned to match the downward force exerted on the pedals. The motor was also very quiet, masked entirely by the sound of the wide, 2.4-inch tires riding over asphalt.\n\nThe Tenways motor is only capable of 45Nm of torque. And without additional gears, the CGO Compact is best for mostly flat environments. It still did better than I expected on hills, easily besting the 35Nm Raleigh One I recently reviewed. For example, I was able to cross a bridge with a 10 percent incline that stymied the Raleigh One, but only if I had a rolling start — otherwise, I had to get off and push. On downhill slopes, the large chainring allowed me to pedal comfortably at speeds approaching 30km/h without my legs frantically spinning out. The pedal-assist, however, quits helping at 25km/h (16mph) in Europe.\n\nI also didn’t experience any of the twitchiness you get from folding bikes with relatively short wheelbases, smaller 16-inch wheels, and narrow handlebars. In general I rode in pedal-assist levels 3 or 4 out of 5, with 3 feeling the most natural, and 4 for when I was in a hurry.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 25 The suspension seat post soaked up bumps on a variety of road surfaces.\n\nOn a full battery I managed to travel 65kms (over 40 miles) before needing a recharge. I received alerts on my iPhone and Apple Watch when the battery dropped to 10 percent, and power dropped noticeably when the estimated remaining range hit 4km. Charging the 494.36Wh battery took a relatively slow 4.5 hours from the bundled charger.\n\nThe CGO Compact was obviously designed by people that actually ride bikes in compact European cities. It comes standard with integrated lighting, mudguards, a loud bell, kickstand, and a partially covered transmission to protect trousers, skirts, and long coats from getting snagged. The little crossbar in the step-through frame even doubles as a handle to help hoist the bike up stairs.\n\nCity bikes need to haul things, which is why the CGO Compact comes fitted with the click-and-go MIK HD rear carrier system. It supports loads up to 27kg (almost 60 pounds) — enough to fit a compatible crate or child seat. The e-bike also has mounting points up front for a bottle cage or rack.\n\nIn general, the Android and iOS app is fine, but it’s rarely needed. It might eventually be useful for buying accessories and insurance, or starting a chat with support and finding the nearest service center. It also promises to show riding data collected by date, but this never worked for me, only showing zeroes.\n\nTenways’ CGO Compact is an excellent e-bike for €1,999 (about $2,365). The riding experience, everyone agrees, has been stellar. And when it eventually needs servicing, Tenways has a solid network of local bike shops in Europe to provide support, with a ready supply of the off-the-shelf parts from brands you know.\n\nThe CGO Compact is a highly adaptable e-bike that rides big and tucks away small, making it an ideal companion for European city life. It’s also exceedingly shareable — but nobody would blame you for keeping it all for yourself.\n\nCGO Compact Specs Tenways C9 Hub Motor (250W, 45Nm torque)\n\nSingle-speed Gates CDN Carbon belt drive\n\n494.36Wh removable battery\n\nSuspension seat post for Selle Royal saddle\n\nTektro hydraulic disc brakes\n\nByschulz Speedlifter Twist Stem\n\nBike weight: 24kg (almost 53 pounds) with all accessories\n\nMax load: 145kg (320 pounds)\n\nMIK HD Rear Carrier system with 27kg (almost 60 pounds) max load\n\nFits riders 160cm and 190cm (5ft 2in to 6ft 2in)\n\nAccessory mounting points on head tube\n\nIntegrated front and rear lighting with daytime running light\n\nLCD display\n\nBasic app for iOS and Android\n\nPhotography by Thomas Ricker / The Verge"

Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service.\n\nAmerica’s warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech. This decision is final."

            "content": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced late on Friday that his company has reached an agreement allowing the Department of Defense to use its AI models in the department’s classified network.\n\nThis follows a high-profile standoff between the department — also known under the Trump administration as the Department of War — and OpenAI’s rival Anthropic. The Pentagon pushed AI companies, including Anthropic, to allow their models be used “all lawful purposes,” while Anthropic sought to draw a red line around mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released Thursday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said the company “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner,” but he argued that “in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.”\n\nMore than 60 OpenAI employees and 300 Google employees signed an open letter this week asking their employers to support Anthropic’s position.\n\nAfter Anthropic and the Pentagon failed to reach an agreement, President Donald Trump criticized the “Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic” in a social media post that also directed federal agencies to stop using the company’s products after a six-month phase out period.\n\nIn a separate post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed Anthropic was trying to “seize veto power over the operational decisions of the United States military.” Hegseth also said he is designating Anthropic as a supply-chain risk: “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nOn Friday, Anthropic said it had “not yet received direct communication from the Department of War or the White House on the status of our negotiations,” but insisted it would “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "China’s humanoid robots grabbed global attention with kung fu flips at the nation’s televised Spring Festival Gala, while Chinese phone maker Honor is set to unveil its first humanoid robot at MWC in Spain.\n\nRobotics was flagged as a priority under the country’s “Made in China 2025” plan, albeit originally focused on factory automation, rather than humanoids. Now, rapid advances in multimodal AI are accelerating so-called embodied AI — autonomous machines operating in the real world — a push officials say could help offset labor shortages and drive productivity gains.\n\nAt this early stage of humanoid robot development, Chinese companies are outpacing their U.S. rivals in both speed and volume, Selina Xu, a China and AI policy lead at the office of Eric Schmidt said.\n\n“China has a more robust hardware supply chain — much of it built up through the EV sector, from sensors to batteries — and the world’s strongest manufacturing base, allowing companies to iterate far faster than Western competitors,” Xu told TechCrunch.\n\nAs a result, not only are Chinese robots cheaper but companies can also release new models more quickly, Xu noted, adding that leading Chinese player Unitree shipped roughly 36 times more units last year than U.S. rivals Figure and Tesla.\n\nGlobal humanoid robot shipments totaled just 13,317 units last year, according to a Forbes report released last month. That is a tiny base for an industry expected to nearly double annually and reach 2.6 million units by 2035. (Still, the figures should be viewed with caution. The report notes it remains unclear how many units represent commercial sales versus demo models or pilot deployments, underscoring the early-stage nature of the industry.)\n\nThe top humanoid robot makers by 2025 shipments were led by China’s Agibot and Unitree, followed by UBTech, Leju Robotics, Engine AI, and Fourier Intelligence, underscoring Beijing’s early dominance in the sector.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe biggest shift recently has been from “demo-driven excitement” to “operations-driven adoption,” Yuli Zhao, chief strategy officer at Galbot, told TechCrunch. Galbot’s humanoid robot, the G1, appeared at this year’s Spring Festival Gala, China’s annual, state-run lunar New Year’s Eve television show, alongside robots from Unitree Robotics, Noetix, and MagicLab.\n\n“More customers are asking: Can the robot run stably in real environments and actually take work off people’s plates? That practical pull is strengthened in China because policy and industrial strategy encourage automation upgrades, and the manufacturing ecosystem makes iteration extremely fast,” Zhao said.\n\nWhile increased funding toward humanoid startups “has definitely accelerated” the pace of progress, “the most durable adoption comes when you can show reliable and repeatable value in production or service operations, not just a one-off showcase,” Zhao added.\n\nStill, investing helps and Chinese robotics makers are securing it. Last year Unitree was valued at around $3 billion after closing its Series C, with ambitions to reach as much as $7 billion in a future IPO. Meanwhile, Galbot has raised more than $300 million in fresh funding, reportedly pushing its valuation to $3 billion, one of the largest financings in China’s humanoid robotics sector to date.\n\nU.S. companies are moving beyond flashy demos as well to focus on real-world deployments. Plus, they are pursuing their own aggressive goals. U.S. startup Foundation, for instance, plans to build 50,000 humanoid robots by the end of 2027.\n\nBut China is already targeting a mix of affordable mass-market models and high-end applications, rapidly expanding humanoids across industrial, consumer, and rehabilitation sectors, according to a December TrendForce report.\n\nBottlenecks to China’s dominance\n\nWhen it comes to AI systems and integrated software, it’s still unclear where Chinese humanoid firms truly stand. The industry is largely betting on vision-language-action models and “world models,” but both technologies remain in early stages. Nvidia currently leads the space with its end-to-end humanoid software stack, according to Xu, so naturally most humanoid startups in China are powered by Nvidia’s Orin chips. However, domestic chipmakers are developing homegrown alternatives, she said.\n\nYet humanoid robotics makers are still working on fundamental problems. The challenge is enabling robot foundation models to predict the “next physical state” the robot will face in unpredictable environments, like how large language models predict the next word. But unlike LLMs, humanoid robotics companies can’t simply scrape the internet for training data, Xu said. So most are relying on simulation environments, which generates synthetic data, though real-world data collection remains essential.\n\n“Because of the data scarcity problem, humanoids are still far away from autonomy. The hardware is currently ahead of the software — the robot body can handle a lot more dexterity today than years ago (though it has reliability issues, as we saw with the robots that broke down at humanoid marathons), but the brain is still nascent,” the analyst said.\n\nSafety is a major hurdle for humanoid robots, too. One high-profile accident could trigger public backlash, and China is likely weighing how to roll out the technology quickly without moving too fast. As the industry matures, more regulations are expected.\n\nGiven the lack of data, Zhao believes that demand for humanoids will grow first in fairly contained workplaces.\n\n“Early momentum is likely to be in industrial manufacturing, warehouse logistics, and retail, where tasks are repetitive, hours are long, and processes are clear — creating real demand and ideal conditions for humanoid robots to deliver value at scale,” he said.\n\nOther APAC players\n\nHumanoid robot development is not a two-country race. Japan’s robotics ecosystem — from startups to semiconductor heavyweights — is targeting humanoid mass production by 2027. Long a pioneer through projects like Honda’s Asimo, Murata Manufacturing’s Murata Boy, and SoftBank Robotics’ Pepper, Japan leans on precision and advanced control. One area unique to this nation: Humanoid robots are increasingly used in eldercare.\n\nCoral Capital CEO James Riney, who invests in tech companies in Japan, believes Tokyo will continue to thrive in the humanoid robotics industry. “There are three factors likely to drive the adoption of robotics in Japan. One is the labor shortage and the desire to depend less on mass immigration. The second is the widespread cultural view of robots as our friends — more Doraemon vs. Terminator. The third is that Japan is already dominant in many parts of the robotics supply chain.”\n\nHyundai Motor’s Boston Dynamics unit introduced a new Atlas humanoid for factory use by 2028, with plans to produce up to 30,000 units annually in the U.S. as part of its AI-driven robotics push.\n\nStill, for China, government policy, industrial strategy, labor shortages, and private capital are all converging to turbocharge the country’s humanoid robotics push.\n\n“China’s leadership is best understood as a speed-to-scale advantage,” Zhao said. “The ecosystem here compresses the entire cycle — R&D, supply chain, manufacturing, integration, and customer deployment — into a very tight loop. That means humanoid companies can move from prototype to real-world deployment faster, learn from real operations, and iterate at a pace that’s difficult to match elsewhere.”"

New Delhi ordered internet providers to block its website, resulting in patchy access across networks.\n\nThe blocking order was issued on February 24 under Section 69A of India’s Information Technology Act, according to a source familiar with the matter. The provision empowers the government to restrict public access to online content.\n\nThe Indian government did not publicly cite a reason for the move, and it was not immediately clear whether the action was linked to a cybersecurity concern, copyright complaint, or another issue. It was also unclear how long the restrictions would remain in place.\n\nAccess to Supabase has been inconsistent in India over the past several days, with the San Francisco-based company acknowledging the issue in posts on social media starting Wednesday. While the restrictions were first reported by Supabase on Reliance Industries’ JioFiber network, users have since flagged similar problems across multiple internet providers and telecom networks. In one post on Friday, Supabase tagged India’s IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, asking him to intervene and restore access, though the company later removed the message and said in a subsequent update that the site remained blocked for many users in the country.\n\nWe understand many users in India continue to be blocked from accessing Supabase.

A technology consultant working with local startups, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were unable to reliably access Supabase for both development and production purposes.\n\nWhile Supabase suggested workarounds such as switching DNS settings or using a VPN (which reroute internet traffic to bypass local restrictions), the founder said such steps were not practical for most end users.\n\nAt the time of publication, TechCrunch was able to verify that supabase.co remained inaccessible on ACT Fibernet, JioFiber and Airtel connections in New Delhi. However, two users on ACT Fibernet in Bengaluru said they were still able to access the service, suggesting the restrictions may be unevenly implemented.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The platform’s global traffic jumped more than 111% year over year to about 4.2 million visits in January. In India, visits rose roughly 179% to about 365,000, compared with a 168.5% increase in the U.S. to about 627,000.\n\nThe incident highlights broader concerns about India’s website blocking regime, said Raman Jit Singh Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now.\n\n“This is a simple fact that has grave consequences for developers and others,” he told TechCrunch. “You don’t know where you can safely run projects without the danger that something might happen where it gets blocked, and suddenly you’re scrambling to find a way.”\n\nIndia has previously faced criticism over broad website blocking measures. In 2014, authorities briefly restricted access to developer platform GitHub, along with services such as Vimeo, Pastebin and Weebly, during a security probe. Users on some Indian networks in 2023 also reported that a key GitHub content domain had been blocked by certain ISPs, according to earlier reports.\n\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Paul Copplestone and CTO Ant Wilson, Supabase positions itself as an open-source alternative to Firebase built on PostgreSQL. The startup has gained traction amid rising interest in so-called “vibe coding” tools and AI-driven app development, and has raised about $380 million across three funding rounds since September 2024, lifting its valuation to $5 billion.\n\nIndia’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, as well as telecom providers including ACT Fibernet, Bharti Airtel, and Reliance Jio, did not respond to requests for comment. Copplestone and Wilson also did not respond."

The president allowed for a six-month phase-out period for departments using the products, but emphasized that Anthropic was no longer welcome as a federal contractor.\n\n“We don’t need it, we don’t want it, and will not do business with them again,” the president wrote in the post.\n\nNotably, the president’s post did not mention any plans to designate Anthropic as a supply chain risk, as had been previously mentioned as a consequence. However, a subsequent tweet from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made good on the threat.\n\n“In conjunction with the President’s directive for the Federal Government to cease all use of Anthropic’s technology, I am directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security,” Secretary Hegseth wrote. “Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”\n\nAnthropic said Friday that while the company has not heard from the government directly, it will “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.”\n\nThe Pentagon dispute centered on Anthropic’s refusal to allow its AI models to be used to power either mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons, which Secretary Hegseth found unduly restrictive.\n\nCEO Dario Amodei reiterated his stance in a public post on Thursday, refusing to compromise on the two points.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Per the BBC, CEO Sam Altman sent a memo to staff on Thursday saying he shared the same “red lines” and that any OpenAI-related defense contracts would also reject uses that were “unlawful or unsuited to cloud deployments, such as domestic surveillance and autonomous offensive weapons.”\n\nOpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, who very publicly fell out with Altman in November 2023 and has since co-founded his own AI company, also waded into the conversation on Friday, writing on X: “It’s extremely good that Anthropic has not backed down, and it’s significant that OpenAI has taken a similar stance.”\n\nBut within hours of the Trump administration ordering federal agencies to cut ties with Anthropic, OpenAI moved to fill the void, announcing a deal with the Pentagon that Altman said preserved the same core principles Anthropic had fought for — prohibitions on domestic surveillance and autonomous weapons.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, OpenAI and the government began meeting about a potential tie-up on Wednesday of this week.\n\nSurely, there will be more twists to come.\n\nAnthropic, OpenAI and Google each received contract awards from the U.S. Defense Department last July. While some Google employees have come out in support of Anthropic, Google and its parent company have yet to comment.\n\nUpdate: This story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "In a newly released deposition filed in Elon Musk’s case against OpenAI, the tech executive attacked OpenAI’s safety record, claiming that his company, xAI, better prioritizes safety. He went so far as to say that “Nobody has committed suicide because of Grok, but apparently they have because of ChatGPT.”\n\nThe comment came up in a line of questioning about a public letter Musk signed in March 2023. In it, he called on AI labs to pause development of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4, OpenAI’s flagship model at the time, for at least six months. The letter, which was signed by over 1,100 people, including many AI experts, stated there was not enough planning and management taking place at AI labs, as they were locked in an “out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one — not even their creators — can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\n\nThose fears have since gained credibility. OpenAI now faces a series of lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT’s manipulative conversation tactics have led several people to experience negative mental health effects, with some dying by suicide. Musk’s comment suggests that these incidents could be used as fodder in his case against OpenAI.\n\nThe transcript of Musk’s video testimony, which took place back in September, was filed publicly this week, ahead of the expected jury trial next month.\n\nThe lawsuit against OpenAI centers on the company’s shift from a nonprofit AI research lab to a for-profit company, which Musk claims violated its founding agreements. As part of his arguments, Musk claims that AI safety could be compromised by OpenAI’s commercial relationships, as such relationships would place speed, scale, and revenue above safety concerns.\n\nHowever, since that recording, xAI has faced safety concerns of its own. Last month, Musk’s social network X was flooded with nonconsensual nude images generated by xAI’s Grok, some of which were said to be of minors. This led the California Attorney General’s office to open an investigation into the matter. The EU is also running its own investigation, and other governments have taken action, too, with some imposing blocks and bans.\n\nIn the newly filed deposition, Musk claimed he had signed the AI safety letter because “it seemed like a good idea,” not because he had just incorporated an AI company looking to compete with OpenAI.\n\n“I signed it, as many people did, to urge caution with AI development,” Musk said. “I just wanted … AI safety to be prioritized.”\n\nImage Credits:imgflip\n\nMusk also responded to other questions in the deposition, including those about artificial general intelligence, or AGI — the concept of AI that can match or surpass human reasoning across a broad range of tasks — saying “it has a risk.” He also confirmed that he “was mistaken” about his supposed $100 million donation to OpenAI; the second amended complaint in the case puts the actual figure closer to $44.8 million.\n\nHe also recalled why OpenAI was founded, which, from his perspective, was because he was “increasingly concerned about the danger of Google being a monopoly in AI,” adding that his conversations with Google co-founder Larry Page were “alarming, in that he did not seem to be taking AI safety seriously.” OpenAI was formed as a counterweight to that threat, Musk claimed."

            "content": "The past two weeks have been defined by a clash between Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth as the two battle over the military’s use of AI.\n\nAnthropic refuses to allow its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for fully autonomous weapons that conduct strikes without human input. At the same time, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor, arguing any “lawful use” of the technology should be permitted.\n\nOn Thursday, Amodei publicly signaled that Anthropic isn’t backing down — despite threats that his company could be designated as a supply chain risk as a result. But with the news cycle moving fast, it’s worth revisiting exactly what’s at stake in the fight.\n\nAt its core, this fight is about who controls powerful AI systems — the companies that build them, or the government that wants to deploy them.\n\nWhat is Anthropic worried about?\n\nAs we said above, Anthropic doesn’t want its AI models to be used for mass surveillance of Americans or for autonomous weapons with no humans in the loop for targeting and firing decisions. Traditional defense contractors typically have little say in how their products will be used, but Anthropic has argued from its inception that AI technology poses unique risks and therefore requires unique safeguards. From the company’s perspective, the question is how to maintain those safeguards when the technology is being used by the military.\n\nThe U.S. military already relies on highly automated systems, some of which are lethal. The decision to use lethal force has historically been left to humans, but there are few legal restrictions on military use of autonomous weapons. The DoD doesn’t categorically ban fully autonomous weapons systems. According to a 2023 DOD directive, AI systems can select and engage targets without human intervention, as long as they meet certain standards and pass review by senior defense officials.\n\nThat’s precisely what makes Anthropic nervous. Military technology is secretive by nature, so if the U.S. military were taking steps to automate lethal decision-making, we might not know about it until it was operational. And if it used Anthropic’s models, it could count as “lawful use.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nAnthropic’s position isn’t that such uses should be permanently off the table. It’s that its models aren’t capable enough to support them safely yet. Imagine an autonomous system misidentifying a target, escalating a conflict without human authorization, or making a split-second lethal decision that no one can reverse. Put a less-capable AI in charge of weapons, and you get a very fast, very confident machine that’s bad at making high-stakes calls.\n\nAI also has the power to supercharge lawful surveillance of American citizens to a concerning degree. Under current U.S. laws, surveillance of American citizens is already possible, whether through collection of texts, emails, and other communication. AI changes the equation by enabling automated large-scale pattern detection, entity resolution across datasets, predictive risk scoring, and continuous behavioral analysis.\n\nWhat does the Pentagon want?\n\nThe Pentagon’s argument is that it should be able to deploy Anthropic’s technology for any lawful use it deems necessary, rather than be limited by Anthropic’s internal policies on things like autonomous weapons or surveillance.\n\nMore specifically, Secretary Hegseth has argued the Department of Defense shouldn’t be limited by the rules of a vendor and that it would engage in “lawful use” of the technology.\n\nSean Parnell, the Pentagon’s chief spokesperson, said in a Thursday X post that the department has no interest in conducting mass domestic surveillance or deploying autonomous weapons.\n\n“Here’s what we’re asking: Allow the Pentagon to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes,” Parnell said. “This is a simple, common-sense request that will prevent Anthropic from jeopardizing critical military operations and potentially putting our warfighters at risk. We will not let ANY company dictate the terms regarding how we make operational decisions.”\n\nHe added that Anthropic has until 5:01 p.m. ET on Friday to decide. “Otherwise, we will terminate our partnership with Anthropic and deem them a supply chain risk for DOW,” he said.\n\nDespite the DoD’s stance that it simply doesn’t believe it should be limited by a corporation’s usage policies, Secretary Hegseth’s concerns about Anthropic have at times seemed connected to cultural grievance. In a speech at SpaceX and xAI offices in January, Hegseth railed against “woke AI” in a speech that some saw as a preview of his feud with Anthropic.\n\n“Department of War AI will not be woke,” Hegseth said. “We’re building war-ready weapons and systems, not chatbots for an Ivy League faculty lounge.”\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe Pentagon has threatened to either declare Anthropic a “supply chain risk” — which effectively blacklists Anthropic from doing business with the government — or invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force the company to tailor its model to the military’s needs. Hegseth has given Anthropic until 5:01 p.m. on Friday to respond. But with the deadline approaching, it’s anyone’s guess whether the Pentagon will make good on its threat.\n\nThis is not a fight either party can easily walk away from. Sachin Seth, a VC at Trousdale Ventures who focuses on defense tech, says a supply chain risk label for Anthropic could mean “lights out” for the company.\n\nHowever, he said, if Anthropic is dropped from the DoD, it could be a national security issue.\n\n“[The Department] would have to wait six to 12 months for either OpenAI or xAI to catch up,” Seth told TechCrunch. “That leaves a window of up to a year where they might be working from not the best model, but the second or third best.”\n\nxAI is gearing up to become classified-ready and replace Anthropic, and it’s fair to say given owner Elon Musk’s rhetoric on the matter that the company would have no problem giving the DoD total control over its technology. Recent reports indicate that OpenAI may stick to the same red lines as Anthropic."

            "content": "“This is just not the right pathway forward,” Isaacman said.\n\nA senior NASA official, speaking on background to Ars, noted that the space agency has experienced hydrogen and helium leaks during both the Artemis I and Artemis II prelaunch preparations, and these problems have led to monthslong delays in launch.\n\n“If I recall, the timing between Apollo 7 and 8 was nine weeks,” the official said. “Launching SLS every three and a half years or so is not a recipe for success. Certainly, making each one of them a work of art with some major configuration change is also not helpful in the process, and we’re clearly seeing the results of it, right?”\n\nThe goal therefore is to standardize the SLS rocket into a single configuration in order to make the rocket as reliable as possible, and launching as frequently as every 10 months. NASA will fly the SLS vehicle until there are commercial alternatives to launch crews to the moon, perhaps through Artemis V as Congress has mandated, or perhaps even a little longer.\n\nIs Everyone on Board?\n\nThe NASA official said all of the agency’s key contractors are on board with the change, and senior leaders in Congress have been briefed on the proposed changes.\n\nThe biggest opposition to these proposals would seemingly come from Boeing, which is the prime contractor for the Exploration Upper Stage, a contract worth billions of dollars to develop a more powerful rocket that was due to launch for the first time later this decade. However, in a NASA news release, Boeing appeared to offer at least some support for the revised plans.\n\n“Boeing is a proud partner to the Artemis mission and our team is honored to contribute to NASA’s vision for American space leadership,” said Steve Parker, Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO, in the news release. “The SLS core stage remains the world’s most powerful rocket stage, and the only one that can carry American astronauts directly to the moon and beyond in a single launch. As NASA lays out an accelerated launch schedule, our workforce and supply chain are prepared to meet the increased production needs.”\n\nSolid Reasons for Changing Artemis III\n\nNASA’s new approach to Artemis reflects a return to the philosophy of the Apollo program. During the late 1960s, the space agency flew a series of preparatory crewed missions before the Apollo 11 lunar landing. These included Apollo 7 (a low-Earth-orbit test of the Apollo spacecraft), Apollo 8 (a lunar orbiting mission), Apollo 9 (a low-Earth-orbit rendezvous with the lunar lander), and Apollo 10 (a test of the lunar lander descending to the moon, without touching down).\n\nWith its previous Artemis template, NASA skipped the steps taken by Apollo 7, 9, and 10. In the view of many industry officials, this leap from Artemis II—a crewed lunar flyby of the moon testing only the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft—to Artemis III and a full-on lunar landing was enormous and risky."

            "content": "Residents across Tehran and other Iranian cities were jolted awake by sounds of loud explosions in the early hours of Saturday morning, as Israel and the US launched joint attacks on Iran.\n\nThe attacks, which the US and Israel are calling “preemptive strikes,” come after a period of failed negotiations between the countries, and on the heels of mass protests in Iran earlier this year that saw the death of at least 3,117 civilians, according to government statistics.\n\nShortly after the first set of explosions, Iranians received bursts of notifications on their phones. They came not from the government advising caution, but from an apparently hacked prayer-timing app called ‘BadeSaba Calendar’ that has been downloaded more than 5 million times from the Google Play Store.\n\nThe messages arrived in quick succession over a period of 30 minutes, starting with the phrase ‘Help Has Arrived’ at 9:52 am Tehran time, shortly after the first set of explosions. No party has claimed responsibility for the hacks.\n\nScreenshots shared with WIRED Middle East show messages urging Iranian military personnel to surrender their weapons with the promise of amnesty. They also urged army personnel to join “the forces of liberation” and to “defend your brothers.”\n\nThe push notifications are all titled “Help is on the way”, and call on Iranian military members to surrender. Screenshot: WIRED Middle East\n\n“The time for revenge has come,” one notification received at 10:02 am read (translated from Farsi). “The regime's repressive forces will pay for their cruel and merciless actions against the innocent people of Iran. Anyone who joins in defending and protecting the Iranian nation will be granted amnesty and forgiveness.”\n\n“For the freedom of our Iranian brothers and sisters, this is a call to all oppressive forces—lay down your weapons or join the forces of liberation. Only in this way can you save your lives. For a free Iran,” another message sent at 10:14 am read.\n\nCybersecurity analysts confirmed that BadeSabah users had received notifications around the time of the strikes, but have not been able to identify the source of the hack. “At this point, we genuinely do not know who is behind them, whether it was Israel or other anti-government Iranian groups,” says Narges Keshavarznia, digital rights researcher at the Miaan Group, adding that no hacker group has claimed credit.\n\n“Attribution in cases like this is always complex, and it’s still too early to draw conclusions.”\n\n​​Morey Haber, the chief security advisor at BeyondTrust, however, pointed out that a cyber operation of this nature would almost certainly have been planned in advance.\n\n“The compromise of assets [likely] happened some time ago, and these messages of ‘help’ were timed” strategically, he claims. “This is not a smash-and-grab style of attack. It is nation-state versus nation-state and is being executed with intent and precision.”\n\nIran on Saturday launched retaliatory kinetic attacks targeting key military bases across the Middle East. Explosions were reported in Bahrain, Kuwait, the UAE, and Qatar on Saturday, including multiple missiles that were intercepted.\n\nDigital Blackout, Cyber Warfare\n\nAs the war unfolds, the Iranian public has already faced internet blackouts and weeks of severely reduced connectivity. “The country has been experiencing a widespread internet disruption, and access to the internet has significantly decreased in several parts of the country, including Tehran,” Keshavarznia says.\n\nAccording to internet monitoring tool NetBlocks, overall network traffic has dropped to 4 percent. Data from ArvanCloud’s Radar monitoring system, an Iranian-operated cloud service, indicates that many of the country’s main data centers and domestic PoP sites have either lost connectivity to the international internet or are experiencing severe disruption, Keshavarznia pointed out.\n\nCommunication networks are also down with outages in phone lines and SMS services, and severe degradation of both mobile data and fixed broadband connections. “Incoming international calls to Iran are also reportedly affected. Even using VPNs has become extremely difficult,” she says."

If you’ve never sampled its wares, preferring the latest Apple or Samsung iteration, you might be surprised at just how good these devices are. The Chinese company is the third-largest phone maker in the world behind Apple and Samsung, and it packs all the latest cutting-edge hardware into its annual flagship release. Xiaomi’s Ultra line has long battled for the camera king title.\n\nPhotograph: Simon Hill\n\nAmusingly, Xiaomi skipped the 16 series to compete directly with Apple’s latest iPhone generation. There’s no radical redesign for the 17 Ultra over last year’s Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but there is refinement and a special version called the Leitzphone, designed with Leica, that may prove irresistible to fans of the German camera brand. The Xiaomi 17 Ultra is easily one of the best phones you can’t officially buy in the United States. While importing a Chinese smartphone is not without potential pitfalls, this one will tempt keen American photographers.\n\nLeica a Lot\n\nI’ve always appreciated Leica’s minimalist industrial design. Textured black and silver materials with a splash of red add some identity. It strikes me as a careful balance between form and function, and it comes through very strongly in Xiaomi’s Leitzphone. The aluminum alloy frame is ribbed for enhanced grip, you can rotate the ring around the camera for fine zoom control, and the user interface has an elegant Leica-themed makeover. I’m surprised there’s no dedicated shutter button, though you can add one with the optional photography kit (more on that later)."

I tested it in the Triple Black colorway, which is “strictly limited to 1,000 pieces globally.” This one’s got two interior flaps with a slim, shallow zippered pouch on either side, but otherwise is just one big compartment that led to too much clinking and clanking of contents during my test. It’s great for full-sized products, but my testers and I all preferred bags that hold the products securely upright, as in the less expensive Parallelle Kit, above.\n\nFlat Lay Makeup Box Bag for $37: Available in opaque-fabric and clear (\"jelly\") styles, this unassuming pouch looks like a chubby rectangle with a handle on the end but actually unzips into a flat tray for easy access. There's only one compartment, so I didn't love it as a toiletry bag, but I did love it as a pool and beach accessory bag for sunscreen and makeup.\n\nMonos Metro Toiletry Case for $95: This durable, structured case, available in either nylon or vegan leather, exhibits the class and quality construction Monos is known for. It has one main roomy compartment with three small pockets inside; one zippered. It did a great job of protecting its contents while still being squishable enough to fit in a tightly packed carry-on, though I did find myself wishing it had a handle for carrying.\n\nCalpak Clear Cosmetics Case for $85: Constructed largely of water-resistant, wipe-clean PVC, this clear cosmetic case (I tested the Medium size) zips all the way around and folds flat to reveal two zippered compartments and one smaller zippered mesh bag. It also looks like a cute little purse with its 16 trendy color options, dual handles, and metal bottom studs. However, contents aren't as easy to access as other cosmetic bags that just open from the top—you have to lay the Calpak flat to open both sides, which requires a 16-by-10-inch footprint.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nVera Bradley Toiletry Bags for $30: The erstwhile must-have accessory of both early-aughts Southern sorority girls and their grandmothers, Vera Bradley bags are back with a new spokesperson (Zooey Deschanel), new designs, and updated fabrics like smooth twill and cotton gabardine. (Die-hard fans can rest assured that the staple quilted paisley options are still available.) The new line includes multiple styles of toiletry bags and makeup bags that are lightweight, giftable, and can add a pop of color and personality to your travel setup. I tested several, and my favorite was the Lay-Flat Travel Organizer—its two interior clear zippered compartments and three mesh slip pockets were roomy yet snug enough to keep all contents of my morning routine secure, and a rather large spill of soap in the large pocket cleaned up quickly. However, even though the fabric is padded, which provides some protection for the interior contents, the exterior is somewhat absorbent and not machine washable (though other designs are), so be forewarned that light-colored options could attract stains.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Blast 4.5L Toiletry Bag for $30: This rectangular toiletry bag can sit on a counter (with about a 10 x 5-inch footprint) or hang with a 360-degree rotating hook. It's machine washable and has a bright orange interior for visibility, sporting five mesh pockets. Both my testers and I liked it a lot. The only thing that kept it from nabbing a top spot is how much space it took up when not hanging, and when it did hang, it stuck out more than the traditional flat hanging styles.\n\nBeis the Dopp Kit for $68: I’ve had Beis' Dopp Kit for four years now, and it’s still my go-to for any trip. The poly canvas material is durable and easy to spot-clean. Plus, I opted for the black version to mask the inevitable scuffs and smaller stains. What I love the most, though, are the compartments. The water-resistant section is a total game-changer when packing liquids or fragrances. If something leaks, a quick wipe gets the job done. The waterproof bottom is also a huge bonus when I’m getting ready at a bathroom sink. —Boutayna Chokrane\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nThule Aion Toiletry Bag for $65: This spacious, 5-liter bag with an 11 x 5-inch footprint features many thoughtful touches, including a wipe-clean interior with a rubbery, water-resistant bottom to protect it from wet countertops. (Though there's also a handy strap that snaps to hang on any-diameter hook or rack.) The sides snap down to compress, almost like a packing cube, and I like that it's squishable to fit into a smaller suitcase. It also comes with a removable translucent bag for taking liquids through the airport security line. However, it does take up a lot of space when not snapped down, and the waxed canvas does attract a lot of lines and marks, which may not be to everyone's aesthetic taste.\n\nNex Dopp for $73: The small and large Dopp kits I tested, part of Nex’s 2024 Hawaii collection, consisted of a roomy, single compartment with a dual zippered strip. They’re made of microfiber leather, which is a higher-quality synthetic leather, said to be softer and more durable. The bags were stiff and well-structured, which felt protective of my cosmetics when jammed into my carry-on. There is a slight synthetic smell from the microfiber leather, which is hard to miss, since you must lean your face quite close to the bag to see the contents in the cavernous single compartment. I also felt that when the bag was unzipped, the zippered strip was either in the way or had to be splayed out, which took up too much space on my tiny hotel-bathroom shelf. Otherwise, this is a fine option that offers both a lifetime warranty and an unlimited trade-in program.\n\nCotopaxi Nido Accessory Bag Cada Día for $50: Cotopaxi’s trim little bag is meant not just for hygiene items, but any collection of odds and ends. It’s made from light recycled deadstock nylon (so, probably not for you if you are carrying glass bottles or anything that needs padding) and weighs in at a modest 6.5 ounces. Your colorway will be unique! I like the surprisingly capacious 4-liter capacity spread over three different compartments, with a big middle compartment for your quart-size, TSA-approved bag of liquids and two other compartments with separate, smaller pockets. I do have to admit, though, that I like hooks better than loops, and hanging is more convenient with a clamshell toiletry bag design than with this one, which can't be hung while open. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nKusshi Hair Tools Bag for $89: Unlike similar bags that just bunch up your hair tools into a roll, this hair tool carrier has two organized pocket sections; a zippered pouch in the middle for hair products or, in my case while I was testing, attachments for my Shark FlexFusion; and a pocket on the outside for rubber bands or small accessories like lip balm. It's also made of neoprene that's heat-resistant up to 380 degrees Fahrenheit, so you don't have to worry about waiting for your tools to cool down before packing them away. Keep in mind, though, that the initial off-gassing is strong with this one—you may want to let it sit in a well-ventilated area for several days before packing it in your suitcase, lest it make everything else smell plasticky. This included the air from my hair dryer when I used it. There are also reports online of it not accommodating some Dyson tools, though it did fit an Airstrait and Corrale.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nAer Travel Kit 2 Ultra for $79: Does the average traveler need a toiletry bag made partially of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), which is 15 times stronger than steel by weight? Perhaps not, but it definitely makes for an interesting bag. Part of Aer’s 10th Anniversary Ultra Collection, this hardy, chunky little Dopp kit incorporates the collection's Ultra400X fabric (in black only) by Challenge Sailcloth, known for its high-performance sails for yacht racers and kite surfers. Despite its strength, the Travel Kit is still pretty lightweight at 8 ounces. However, the hook is thick plastic and too small for a towel rack, and the rubbery “Aer” brand tags on the outside and inside seem to accumulate toothbrush and soap residue, as does the mesh zippered pouch in the top compartment. Both proved somewhat difficult to clean.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Trifold Toiletry Kit for $50: Eagle Creek's travel accessory game is extremely strong. Its toiletry bags, packing cubes, and various organizers are affordable, sturdy, and exceedingly well designed, and this toiletry bag is no exception. At first glance, it looks like two toiletry bags snapped together, but each side unzips to make a hanging organizer with six compartments. The only problem is that one side of the bag holds products upside down until it's unfurled, which led to items falling out in my tests.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nState Bags Benson Toiletry Kit for $65: This is a solid, simple bag with three mesh pouches and a snap-in/snap-out plastic envelope that can hold a toothbrush and toothpaste or shower items like soap. The navy version I tested had a coated polyester wipe-clean exterior and interior made from recycled bottles, and I liked that it had the option to hang. However, the organization was more rudimentary than similar-category bags we tested, and it was missing some of the thoughtful details featured on other bags in the same price range, like a quick-access pouch on the back and a larger hook with a rubber tip to prevent slipping. (This bag's thick, small plastic hook wasn't even wide enough to hang on a towel rack.)\n\nCuyana Travel Beauty Case for $298: Those still chasing the quiet luxury aesthetic will love this elegant zippered cosmetic case, available in black or pale pink. It’s made of high-end-feeling Italian pebbled leather both inside and out, with gold hardware and “Cuyana” discreetly printed on the bottom. It opens clamshell-style, and the lid contains a snap-close cover concealing a brush holder with elastic loops. A removable pouch snaps onto that lid cover, and the main compartment has a pocket for securing tubes, bottles, and small tools. Contents aren’t as immediately accessible as they are in other cosmetic cases I tested, but they are more secure. This bag is also on the heavy side, even for a cosmetics case, weighing in at 1.6 pounds, but if you can swing the price, this is a well-made, timeless investment for your travel arsenal.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nCincha the Toiletry Bag for $55: After testing nearly every style of toiletry bag in existence, I thought I had seen it all, but this thoughtfully designed bag from Cincha surprised me. The large size is essentially the tackle box of toiletry bags. It zips open in the middle to reveal four roomy compartments—two on each side, each topped with a small, translucent vinyl zippered pouch. I could not believe the amount of stuff I was able to fit into this thing, and yet I never had trouble closing it, despite packing it to the absolute max. I ended up taking it on a five-day getaway where I had to share a bathroom with two other people, and I found that I loved being able to flip it over and lift the “lid” of whatever side I needed, in order to keep the counter footprint small.\n\nJuly Hanging Toiletry Bag for $85: I own and love July's carry-on suitcase, so I was excited to try the brand's popular hanging toiletry bag. It's a great design with a zippered pouch on the back, plus a body that zips flat to reveal PVC and pouch zip compartments and a large, rubber-tipped metal hook that tucks away. It looks well-made and stylish with leather trim and gunmetal hardware, but my husband took it on a business trip and found that its pockets are actually quite small, confirming a worry I had when I tested it in my bathroom at home. It wouldn't be an issue if the bag itself were small, but it took up a full quarter of the carry-on.\n\nTumi Alpha Bravo Response Kit for $225: This rugged-looking, ballistic nylon bag has the classic Tumi Tracer inside to help facilitate its return to you if it gets lost, as well as an antimicrobial lining. It can hang, stand up, or lie flat and has several convenient internal pockets and an external zipped pouch. It's a lot of money for a toiletry bag with many of the same features as ones half the price, but if you're a Tumi fan and need a toiletry bag to match your luggage, you could do worse than this model.\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBeautifect Go Mini for $177: WIRED reviewer Louryn Strampe loved the larger Beautifect Box, and I tested the Mini to see if it would work for travel. While the smaller size does make it more portable (along with a purse-like carry strap), the multifunction lighted mirror and its battery made the lid top-heavy, so it kept flopping forward when I tried to use it on a soft, uneven surface like my lap or a bed. It's also got a very hard case and is a bit heavy at almost 2.5 pounds, so as much as I wanted to take it with me on a plane, I ended up bringing a smaller bag instead. Worth a buy if you want a makeup case with a lighted mirror, but it's definitely best for day trips.\n\nFjallraven Kanken Toiletry Bag for $60: I love this thing, which makes me feel like a Red Cross nurse on the battlefields of World War II. It’s made from a proprietary Fjallraven fabric blend that combines organic cotton with recycled polyester, so it feels like fabric but is more waterproof and durable. It has a clamshell design with a sturdy interior plastic hook. My quart bag of bottles goes into the enormous lower zip compartment, my toothbrush and deodorant in the top compartment, and there are mesh pockets and MOLLE webbing so that your tiny things are easily visible. However, its dimensions are very large, so this might not be for you if you’re a minimalist with just a toothbrush and a comb. —Adrienne So\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nTom Beckbe Canvas Dopp Kit for $195: Known for its high-end jackets, field hats, and vests for fishing and waterfowl hunting, Birmingham, Alabama-based sports outfitter Tom Beckbe also makes a Dopp kit made of full-grain distressed leather and the brand’s proprietary Field Canvas. It matches the genteel Southern vibe of Tom Beckbe’s collection of other travel bags and related accessories like camo whiskey totes and insulated shooting gloves. If the Marlboro Man ever left the ranch, this is definitely the Dopp kit he would have used. The only downside is that the bag is relatively large—and dark inside—for what’s essentially one compartment.\n\nEagle Creek Pack-It Isolate Quick Trip for $25: This little bag is a simple design, made from recycled bottles, with a zipper on the top and on the side. However, its light weight and semi-structured shape make it perfect for holding a wallet and keys at the gym, or even as a tech pouch for work purposes.\n\nKusshi Neoprene Wristlet Clutch for $39: It's a purse! It's a toiletry bag! It's a purse that doubles as a toiletry bag! This clutch is the perfect size for a larger phone, e-reader, or small tablet, with a couple of mesh pockets for makeup. I used it to tote a day's worth of makeup and skincare around town and found it was just heavy enough to be burdensome, but if you like the neoprene look and your essentials are lightweight, this clutch, like most Kusshi products, is sturdy and well-made.\n\nSympl Dopp Kit for $75: I liked this bag’s durable Cordura exterior and stow-away clip for hanging, as well as the fact it has a lifetime warranty. The bag opens clamshell-style to reveal four simple waterproof zip pockets—two thin and horizontal, one small rectangle, and one larger rectangle. It's an interesting idea, but in practice, this severely limits utility since a user is restricted to specific toiletry-sized products that fit the shape of each of the pockets. (My deodorant did not fit, nor did a toothbrush in a case.)\n\nPhotograph: Kat Merck\n\nBagsmart Paz Hanging Toiletry Bag for $35: With its stylish, padded exterior; generously sized carry handle; and ability to transport up to eight full-sized products, this one had me reaching for it long after the testing period was over. The thin, tipped metal hanger makes it easy to hang anywhere, and there's an easy-access compartment on the front with loops for makeup brushes or other long, thin items. In fact, this is almost a small toiletry briefcase rather than a bag—the whole thing unfurls into a 33-inch-long organizer with four separate compartments (two with sections to hold full-sized products). It will almost certainly be too much for anyone who likes to travel light, but if you check your luggage, will be on the road for a long time, or just don't want to deal with decanting your personal care products, this is a well-designed and easy-to-use solution.\n\nSaltyface Everywhere Bag for $36: Technically designed to store Saltyface self-tanners and bronzers, this puffy black fabric bag spent an indordinate amount of time on my counter, simply because I liked how it looked. Practically speaking, though, the handle was too small for an adult-sized hand, and I found myself becoming irritated with the single zipper pull, so it's not ideal as a general-purpose travel toiletry bag.\n\nFAQs\n\nHow I Test Toiletry Bags AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron For bags our team hasn’t already been using for years, I spend a four-week period rotating new toiletry bags during my morning routine. I note any annoyances or unique details, volume, how easy it is to store and retrieve items, how much space each one takes up on the vanity, how they survive being splashed with water and soap, and, if the bag can hang, how easy it is to retrieve items once hanging. About every three months, my family goes on trips that require stays in hotels. I always take different groups of bags and determine how easy it is to use multiple bags at once in a small space, if hook designs allowed for multiple places to hang, and whether the contents spilled in or otherwise dirtied the bags, and if so, how easy they are to clean. For bags I am not able to take on trips, I lend them to friends and family members who are traveling and take down their notes to consider alongside my own home testing. How Does WIRED Obtain Toiletry Bags for Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Some toiletry bags are review samples requested from the manufacturer, while others are purchased and expensed. Review samples are only accepted without promise of editorial coverage. Toiletry bags chosen as picks are reused for durability testing purposes, while all other bags are donated upon completion of testing. What Kind of Toiletry Bag Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Dopp kits, cosmetics cases, hanging bags … the differences between categories aren’t always clear. Here are some of the more common types of toiletry bags you'll come across, and what to consider with each. Dopp kit: Named for leather craftsman Charles Doppelt, who provided “Dopps,” or toiletry kits, for WWII soldiers. “Dopp kit” has evolved over time to indicate any kind of portable toiletry organizer, but commercially, toiletry bags labeled “Dopp kits” tend to be smaller and hold just a handful of necessities for short trips as opposed to larger fold-up hanging bags and cosmetics cases. Cosmetics case: Designed for those who need more than just the necessities, a cosmetics case is usually a much larger boxlike container with specialized compartments for makeup, skin care, hair care, and other necessities. They often come with extras like brush holders and mirrors. Hanging toiletry bag: A bag that, as the name indicates, comes with a hook so that it can be hung on a hook, towel rack, tree, or someplace it won’t take up space on the counter. Often, the user needs to hang them to be able to access all the storage compartments. Something to consider is that hooks can be used up quite quickly if everyone in your hotel room has a hanging bag. All the hooks in our bathroom were taken almost immediately, so my husband ended up having to hang his bag over the toilet, which he wasn’t thrilled about. A good hanging toiletry bag will also have a hook that's thin enough to slip over just about any hook, and be rubber-tipped so it won't slide off.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "Shopping for a MicroSD card can be a little daunting. There are a ton of numbers to consider, a huge number of brands producing cards with similar-sounding features and names, and words like Pro, Extreme, and Express getting thrown around everywhere.\n\nTo make a long story short, unless you're shooting a ton of photos and videos, and doing so even semiprofessionally where losing those shots might be detrimental to your professional reputation, you're fine to buy a MicroSD card from any company whose name you've heard before. I prefer cards from PNY, SanDisk, and Lexar. Keep an eye out for the “U” symbol with a 3 inside, or a “V30” on the card for the best balance of speed and price. There are two exceptions to that suggestion:\n\nIf you're shooting on a high-end camera, you should consider a V60 MicroSD card, if you can find one for a reasonable price. Some cameras have extra video features you can enable with a faster MicroSD card, so check your manual for more info on whether you need to upgrade.\n\nIf you're buying for a Nintendo Switch 2, you'll need an unfortunately more expensive MicroSD Express card. While you can transfer images and videos from your Switch 2 with most regular MicroSD cards, you'll need an Express version to use it for actually running games.\n\nCapacity\n\nHow much storage you need will largely depend on your needs, but there are a few things to consider when debating between 128 GB and 1 TB. The first is that MicroSD cards are tiny, and having to swap them out on the road can be a risky proposition. Costs tend to go up exponentially for 1 TB and 2 TB cards, but the gap between 256 GB and 512 GB isn't that large, so I recommend sizing up a bit.\n\nThe other factor is that storage sizes are also separated into different standards, so you'll want to make sure your device actually supports that larger card. Cards that are 64 GB are higher are technically “SDXC” for Extended Capacity, and are currently the most common type, and you should be able to use them in most modern situations.\n\nSpeed\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about MicroSD speeds, we have a write-up with a full explanation of the different speeds and how they interact, but I'll give you the quick rundown here too.\n\nEach MicroSD card will have its actual minimum sequential write speed indicated by a letter and number on the card. The number indicates the speed in MB/s, with the letter representing the generation. A C10, U1, and V10 are all essentially the same speed, just written differently, so you're likely to see multiple symbols printed on each card. I'd recommend checking out the SD Association's page on speeds with a handy chart showing the full comparison.\n\nIn practice, you have to go out of your way to find a MicroSD card that's slower than V30/U3 at most retailers, though you may find them included with some electronics that don't require anything more substantial."

            "content": "The idea of using a laptop cooling pad feels antiquated. These days, laptop chips have become extremely efficient. The fans on MacBooks (if they even have them) are barely used, and both Intel and Qualcomm are pushing efficiency on the Windows front.\n\nBut people keep buying laptop cooling pads, so surely there is a use case in 2026 that actually makes sense, right? I tried out a couple cooling pads paired with a couple of different gaming laptops, and walked away surprised at how effective they could be.\n\nDo Cooling Pads Actually Work?\n\nPhotograph: Luke Larsen\n\nLaptop cooling pads have been around for decades, and the idea has always been simple: provide extra air to blow through a laptop that’s otherwise restricted by its own cooling system. In theory, more air means lower temperatures—and, ultimately, better performance. This is the whole idea of the power modes that exist in Windows, which ramp up the RPMs (rotations per minute) of the fans to add more air to both improve performance. More than that, less heat also means a longer-lasting laptop that doesn't degrade as quickly over time. It’s by that same logic that laptop cooling pads offer help.\n\nThe problem, however, is that a cooling pad is a rather inefficient way of transferring air into your device. Most laptop cooling pads, including the two that I tested, use one large fan or two smaller fans to blast cold air across the bottom of the laptop. This is the first reason why the vast majority of modern laptops won’t benefit much from a cooling pad, as these laptops tend to only have vents along the hinge. Without vents or open holes, blowing air across a sheet of metal or plastic isn't going to do anything to cool the components on the other side. It'll only generate a bunch of fan noise.\n\nGaming laptops are the main exception, though, which is why they are the primary use case for such an accessory. Most gaming laptops have a few open vents, usually above the fans, like the Razer Blade 16, which is one of the laptops I used to test these cooling pads. Laptops like the Blade 16 are designed for intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, or local AI processing—and use a high-wattage GPU and CPU to get the kind of performance you need. My model has two of the most powerful laptop components on the market: the RTX 5090 and Ryzen 9 HX 370. As you might guess, they generate a lot of heat when cranked up. Modern chips tend to max out at 100 degrees Celsius, before throttling back performance to bring down temperatures.\n\nMost laptops use fans to cool these components, but the thickness of the laptop chassis is also a determining factor in how much the system will need to throttle back performance to keep temperatures down. In the end, it's geometry and physics, and every millimeter of space in the laptop chassis has an effect on how cool it can keep its internal components. And unlike in a large desktop PC, you have very restricted space. That's especially true in the modern era, where even gaming laptops have become increasingly thin."

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee released a report this week pinpointing more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses stemming from identity theft that came out of four major breaches of data broker firms. US senator Maggie Hassan launched the investigation in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found that some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines.\n\nThe US Department of Justice’s recent release of 3 million documents related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein included grand jury subpoenas to Google that shed light on how federal investigators interact with tech companies and how they respond to government requests for information.\n\nThe Mexican drug cartel CJNG may survive the killing of its longtime leader Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes in part thanks to its prolific use of technologies like drones, social media, and AI. Meanwhile, the Mexican Navy announced on Thursday that it had seized a semi-submersible vessel carrying nearly 4 tons of cocaine as part of a recent initiative to deter drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean. The effort comes as the US has launched its own purported campaign against maritime trafficking via a series of deadly attacks on boats in the Caribbean.\n\nMeanwhile, as AI assistant agents like OpenClaw explode in popularity—and sow chaos around the web—a new open source project called IronCurtain is using a unique design to secure and constrain agentic AI before it can go rogue.\n\nAnd there’s more. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there.\n\nSetting an autonomous internet-enabled robot loose in your house should give anyone a moment’s pause. When that robot is a roving vacuum cleaner equipped with a camera and microphone that could be hijacked from anywhere in the world with nothing more than its serial number, it becomes an actual privacy horror story.\n\nOne such robovac owner, Sammy Azdoufal, discovered that absurd security vulnerability while attempting an experiment in piloting his DJI Romo robot vacuum cleaner with a PS5 controller. He found that he could instead control 6,700 of the robots in 24 countries around the world, with full access to the floor plans they generated of their owners’ homes and their video and audio feeds. When The Verge contacted Azdoufal, he was able to instantly access a Romo owned by a staffer at the tech news outlet just by knowing its 14-digit serial number. DJI has now fixed the vulnerability in response to Azdoufal essentially live-tweeting his findings. But the story nonetheless raises serious questions about the security of other audio- or video-enabled internet-of-things gadgets—not to mention ones capable of freely roaming your home.\n\nWhile the Department of Homeland has been hugely empowered under the Trump administration in its mission to deport millions of immigrants, the organization within DHS that serves as the United States’ primary cyber defender, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, has been neglected. Now its acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, has been replaced as CISA seeks to find new footing.\n\nEven before that news, CyberScoop this week reported on the crises that have plagued the agency for the entire first year since Trump’s inauguration: A third of the staff has been laid off and entire divisions of the agency have been closed. Nominations for a permanent director have been blocked in Congress. Its capabilities have withered, and organizations that had sought out CISA for assistance and partnerships have looked elsewhere. Gottumukkala has suffered his own more personal scandals such as ousting security personnel after he failed a polygraph test and sharing sensitive contracts on ChatGPT. Now Nick Andersen, who has served as CISA’s executive director for cybersecurity, will replace Gottumukkala at the beleaguered agency.\n\nA researcher at King’s College London pitted three popular large language models against each other in simulated war game scenarios and found that, 95 percent of the time, at least one of the models opted to deploy tactical nuclear weapons. The researcher also found, when an AI model deployed a tactical nuclear weapon, its AI opponent only deescalated a fourth of the time. None of the companies behind the three models—OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic—responded to New Scientist’s request for comment.\n\nAI’s role in war-fighting has lurched into the spotlight this week. Anthropic and the Department of War are embroiled in a contract dispute over whether Anthropic’s AI models can be used to power fully autonomous weapons and mass domestic surveillance. Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO, wrote in a statement that these types of use cases “can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values.” In turn, President Donald Trump has threatened to ban the use of Anthropic products, including its Claude chatbot, within the US government. Meanwhile, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees have signed an open letter asking for their bosses to “put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War's current demands for permission to use our models for domestic mass surveillance and autonomously killing people without human oversight.”\n\nA new app for Android phones called Nearby Glasses lets users scan for smart glasses in your vicinity, revealing the presence of the wearable gadgets, which are sometimes indistinguishable from normal glasses and let wearers record people without their knowledge. The app scans for the unique Bluetooth signatures that the glasses emit, and sends users a notification if it detects a nearby source.\n\nThe developer told 404 Media that he was inspired to build the app after reading about several incidents involving smart glasses. Over the summer, 404 Media reported that a Customs and Border Protection agent had donned a pair during an immigration raid, and this fall the outlet also reported that men were using smart glasses to film massage parlor workers, seemingly without their knowledge or consent. In February, The New York Times reported that one smart-glasses developer, Meta, had plans to integrate face recognition into its glasses, spurring fresh concerns among privacy experts."

            "content": "When you go to perform the dreaded chore that is cleaning your toilet bowl, you likely notice that simply flushing your toilet isn't enough to get the rim clean. However, this may soon be a problem of the past.\n\nAt KBIS 2026, the CNET team saw a new toilet from Japanese toilet manufacturer Toto, the Aurora Washlet Plus S7A, designed to increase toilet bowl cleaning coverage by up to five times compared to standard gravity-flush toilets.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus bidet toilet uses a new flushing technology that cleans the entire bowl and rim in a single flush. Toto\n\nHow the Aurora Washlet Plus cleans itself\n\nAt KBIS, Toto unveiled its new Integravity System within the Aurora Washlet Plus. It's a dual-valve, gravity-driven flush engine that uses rim wash and siphon-jet action in sequence to keep your toilet bowl cleaner for longer. It also works in concert with Toto's Tornado-style flushing (which the company calls \"the best flush in the industry\") and the Cefiontect ceramic bowl glaze, which prevents mold and grime from sticking, to clean all 360 degrees of your toilet bowl in one flush.\n\nA diagram showing how the Toto Integravity System works inside the Aurora Washlet Plus toilet. Toto\n\nExtra fancy features on this porcelain throne\n\nIn addition to its cleaning capabilities, Toto designed the Aurora Washlet Plus to quietly flush with water efficiency. Per flush, it uses 1 or 1.28 gallons of water. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, the current federal standard is 1.6 gallons per flush, meaning this toilet uses at least 0.32 gallons less per flush.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus also has an integrated bidet. If you're a bidet user, then you know how challenging it can be to keep the bidet wand clean, as well as the toilet bowl. To help with this, the Aurora Washlet Plus uses an electrolyzed water cleaning agent called Ewater Plus to auto-clean the wand before and after every use, and Premist to mist the bowl before every use to prevent debris from clinging. The stain-resistant Clean Resin material makes it easier for both the wand and toilet seat to stay pristine.\n\nThe Aurora Washlet Plus was named after the aurora borealis and inspired by its quiet power. Toto\n\nThe only setback\n\nThe toilet is impressive but you'll have to dump a lot of cash to get it. David Watsky/CNET\n\nWhile there's a lot to love about this toilet, there's one hitch: It costs $3,648 at full price. You can bring that price down to $2,418 if you go with the Washlet S2 bidet model instead of the Washlet S7A, but you'll lose some features. Certain retailers offer discounts, depending on your location, but paying thousands of dollars for a toilet is still a pretty penny. However, as humans, we do tend to spend quite a bit of time in our bathrooms, so if a futuristic toilet can make our time in there more efficient, it could be worth it.\n\nThe future of the toilet\n\nToilet designs like this one make us think there will one day be a future in which we no longer have to clean our own toilet, and that it will do all the dirty work (literally) for us. This type of feature, especially at a more accessible price, could transform the bathroom into a space for solely self-care rather than another item to check off our cleaning to-do lists. That's a future we can get behind."

            "content": "Downloading a VPN app, creating an account, choosing a plan and connecting to your VPN shouldn't take longer than a minute or so. Nelson Aguilar/CNET\n\nWith so many iPhone VPN apps available, it can be difficult to choose the right one. Based on our extensive research and hands-on testing of VPNs over the years, these are the factors to look out for when choosing the best VPN for iPhone:\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe most important factor to consider with any VPN is privacy. You should never use a VPN provider if you can’t trust that it's taking your privacy seriously, even if you have nothing to hide. Every VPN worth its salt should provide AES 256-bit or ChaCha20 encryption, depending on the VPN protocol you're using.\n\nYour VPN should also have basic privacy features such as a kill switch, DNS leak protection and a solid no-logs policy that is regularly audited. We recommend checking any provider’s privacy policy and reading its audit reports closely, as it’ll give you a good understanding of whether a VPN provider is serious about your privacy. If you notice a mention of data collection or sharing practices in a VPN's privacy policy that don't sit well with you, then it's best to trust your gut and look for a different provider.\n\nIf your privacy needs are critical, then you’ll need to look for a provider that goes above and beyond the standard privacy considerations. Your VPN should be based in a jurisdiction that has strong privacy laws that don't mandate data retention or logging. Choosing a provider that offers obfuscation is also necessary if you’re in a region or network that restricts or bans VPN use outright because it can help hide the fact that you're using a VPN in the first place.\n\nMany of the best VPNs are also rolling out post-quantum protections that help protect against potential future threats from quantum computers, which is essential for privacy-critical users now and in the future. Finally, your provider should offer either a RAM-only server infrastructure or employ full-disk encryption on its hard drives, both of which can help ensure that your data remains secure. There are also some other privacy features that aren’t as vital but still useful, such as ad-blockers, Tor over VPN and multihop connections.\n\nSpeed\n\nYour VPN's connection speeds can have a major influence on the quality of your streaming, downloading, video conferencing, gaming and general web-browsing activities. All VPNs slow down your internet somewhat, simply by nature of encrypting your traffic and routing it through one or more remote servers. To keep things running as smoothly as possible, you'll want a VPN that will have as minimal an impact on your regular internet speeds as possible. Generally, we've found that the best VPNs for iPhone only drop your internet download speed by an average of 25% or less. In our testing, we've seen as low as an average 3% speed loss. For bandwidth-demanding applications like competitive gaming or video streaming, you'll want a fast VPN.\n\nProvider Speed loss Surfshark 21% ExpressVPN 18% NordVPN 3% PIA 49%\n\nUsability\n\nA good VPN for iPhone should run smoothly and be easy to use, regardless of your technical expertise. It should have all of the features you need easily accessible with a tap of your finger. Many of the best iPhone VPN apps also include an easy way to get in touch with support directly from the device, which can be helpful if you need assistance on the go. Basically, your VPN app should be as easy for you to use as your iPhone itself. It should have a large network of servers around the world so you can connect easily and reliably from wherever you may be traveling and be able to help you access geo-restricted content from various regions.\n\nServer network\n\nThink about the cities, states and countries you travel to the most, or want to make it look like you're connecting from. Most of our top-rated VPNs feature thousands of servers in 100-plus countries. Large server networks benefit travel, since you can find a server near where you are for a fast, reliable connection -- usually, the closer you are physically to a VPN server, the less speed loss you'll experience. Additionally, a generous VPN server network is great for unblocking streaming content, since you've got a better chance of finding servers in countries you need to make it look like you're in. Plus, more servers may help maintain better internet speeds, because servers overloaded with users may slow down.\n\nAlongside the total number of servers and countries, think about specialty servers. Some VPN providers, including ExpressVPN, let you torrent on any servers, whereas other VPN providers, like NordVPN and Proton VPN, have P2P servers optimized for peer-to-peer file-sharing.\n\nCertain VPN providers offer servers with beefed-up privacy. For instance, you might find a double VPN, or multihop, VPN servers that feature a second VPN connection to make it even more difficult to trace your web traffic back to you. Likewise, some VPN companies have Tor over VPN, or Onion over VPN servers, which tout similar benefits, with the main difference being that multihop relies on a pair of VPN connections, while onion VPN uses a combination of Tor and a VPN connection simultaneously.\n\nStreaming content unblocking\n\nBecause VPNs route your web traffic through a remote VPN server and change your IP address, apps you use and websites you visit will register your connection as originating from a different location. For instance, if you're in New York City but connected to a VPN server in the UK, apps like Netflix will think you're across the pond. Many streaming services, like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max, BBC iPlayer and CBC Gem, rely on your IP address to load content. Depending on your IP address, which contains general geographical information, the content library might vary a lot or you may not be able to access anything at all. But with a VPN, you can bypass regional restrictions to unblock content on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services. Using a VPN for streaming could even help you save money.\n\nCost\n\nDepending on your budget, you may want to take into account the cost and overall value of your iPhone VPN before making a purchase. VPN pricing can vary greatly from provider to provider but you can typically expect to spend about $5 to $15 per month for a monthly VPN subscription plan. If you want to save some money, you can choose an annual subscription, where prices can range from roughly $30 to $100 or more per year.\n\nYou'll want to be careful with free VPNs because you may end up risking your privacy instead of protecting it. Many free VPNs have slow speeds or have unreliable connections that frequently drop because of overloaded servers. Some even actively degrade your privacy, logging any internet activity through the VPN for sale to third parties or injecting ads into your browsing sessions. Proton VPN is currently the only free VPN that CNET recommends.\n\nMost premium VPNs offer a money-back guarantee anywhere from a week to 45 days. You can also get a seven-day free trial with many VPNs when you sign up through Apple's App Store, so you have options to try various iPhone VPNs risk-free before you decide whether to fully invest in one. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to save money on your VPN subscription.\n\nDevice support\n\nWhile you'll want a VPN for iPhone that works well on iOS, you may have other devices that you want to run a VPN on. Many VPNs work on Windows, MacOS, Linux PCs and Android devices. While Android TV and Fire TV apps are common for use on streaming devices, Apple TV apps are still on the rise. Providers like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Proton VPN, Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish offer Apple TV VPN apps. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Think about the devices you want to install a VPN app on and make sure your desired VPN provider supports those gadgets.\n\nIPVanish Surfshark PIA ProtonVPN ExpressVPN NordVPN Windows ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ MacOS ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Linux ✔️ ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) ✔️ (with GUI) Android/AndroidTV ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ iOS/iPadOS ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Fire TV ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Smart TV* ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Apple TV ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Router ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Browser plugin** ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ ✔️ Simultaneous connections Unlimited Unlimited Unlimited 10 8 10"

That's a gap Splendid Spoon aims to fill with its plant-based, gluten-free smoothies, soups, noodle and grain bowls, wellness shots and oats, which come frozen and ready to defrost in the fridge or heat in the microwave in just a few minutes.\n\nTo see how Splendid Spoon fares in the prepared meal delivery category, I spent two weeks trying the brand's dishes. I also had CNET's wellness editor, Anna Gragert, a vegetarian of 21 years who often eats plant-based, try all the offerings in its Five-Day Detox. It includes a set menu of oats, soups, smoothies, grain bowls and wellness shots, along with intermittent fasting. In early 2026, Splendid Spoon added four new oat bowls and two new grain bowls, which Anna tried and added to this review.\n\nBased on our testing, this is what we think of all the gluten-free, vegan dishes that Splendid Spoon has to offer.\n\nSplendid Spoon's Five-Day Detox includes oats, soups, smoothies, wellness shots and frozen grain bowls. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nHow does Splendid Spoon work?\n\nAs with most meal delivery services, Splendid Spoon is a subscription service, so deliveries will keep coming every week unless you pause or cancel, which you can do at any time.\n\nTo get started, you'll pick a meal plan with either six, 12 or 18 meals per week. The more meals you choose per week, the cheaper they'll be. Depending on what you order, you can pay anywhere from $4.25 to $13.49 per serving, plus $10 shipping. With the 12-meal plan, you get $10 off for free shipping. The 18-meal plan has $20 off, so you get free shipping and an extra $10 off your order.\n\nSplendid Spoon's three plans, plus savings. Splendid Spoon/CNET\n\nAfter you select your plan, you'll pick your meals, choosing smoothies, grain bowls, soups, noodle dishes, oats or shots. Meals are delivered to you frozen with dry ice and recyclable Climacell insulation. Your delivery day will depend on your zip code, and you can see all available options during checkout. As of now, Splendid Spoon delivers only to the lower 48 states.\n\nOn any given week's menu, you'll have over 50 meals to choose from, including around 17 smoothies, with sweeter options like mint-chip and more savory blends like carrot ginger and power greens. There are 10 grain bowls and about 20 soups, along with heartier rice and noodle bowls.\n\nSplendid Spoon has some interesting smoothie recipes. Some flavor combos worked better than others. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nWhat are Splendid Spoon meals like?\n\nAll the food is 100% vegan (no meat, dairy or animal byproducts) and gluten-free. The recipes are made with lots of healthy fruits, vegetables and superfoods like kale, spinach, beans and whole grains. The website says about 95% of the smoothies and wellness shots are organic and that it's all 100% GMO-free.\n\nThere's no shortage of interesting smoothie flavors to choose from, many of them packed with superfoods such as almond butter, kale and goji berries. Splendid Spoon/CNET\n\nMuch of the food is what I'd categorize as healthy food with a good deal of global culinary influence. Think brown rice taco bowl with beans and tomato salsa, or cauliflower tikka masala soup. You won't find many soy-based meat substitutes; these are mostly whole ingredients. Portions aren't huge but they aren't skimpy either, in keeping with the idea of healthy, balanced eating.\n\nBefore choosing any item, you can see the full ingredient list and nutritional information. You can also filter for more specific dietary needs, such as high-fiber, low-carb and high-protein foods.\n\nWhat's on the menu for the Five-Day Detox. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nWhat we tried and how we liked it\n\nI'll preface my critique of Splendid Spoon's smoothies by saying I make a lot of smoothies at home and so I can be particular. Because Splendid Spoon smoothies are preblended, they're a bit more like juices to drink and don't have that creamy, frozen texture I'm used to. Beyond the main ingredients, each one is fortified with healthy superfoods like chia seeds, hemp seeds and pea protein. These additions don't alter the flavor dramatically but deliver dense nutrients and antioxidants.\n\nSmoothies\n\nStrawberry and goji berry with cashew butter: This was just OK. A bit sour for my taste.\n\nCarrot and ginger with mango and dates: An excellent smoothie, with savory and sweet elements in perfect harmony. Anna agrees and especially enjoyed the zing offered by the ginger.\n\nThe carrot-ginger smoothie was tangy, tasty and not too sweet. David Watsky/CNET\n\nPower greens: This green juice smoothie is loaded with good stuff, including organic hemp seeds, chia seeds, spirulina, pea protein and kale. The banana and coconut balanced all the vegetable components with just enough sweetness. Anna, on the other hand, found the addition of lemon to give the smoothie a salad dressing-like taste, but still appreciated all the ingredients individually.\n\nBanana, flax and almonds: I make a nut butter and banana smoothie most mornings. This was different, and the lemon gave it a bright zing, but I still prefer my freshly blended version. This also wasn't Anna's favorite smoothie, as it was a bit tart with a texture that she didn't love.\n\nThe green smoothies taste more like cold-pressed juices. David Watsky/CNET\n\nBlueberry and coconut with acai and cinnamon: Another very good smoothie. The cinnamon and vanilla made it sing.\n\nBlue Majik smoothie with banana, dates, vanilla and cinnamon: A bit sweeter than the smoothies I'm used to, but still extremely tasty and satisfying. Anna also enjoyed this one.\n\nTasty and a fun color to boot. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nDragon fruit berry with pineapple juice, raspberries and avocado: Anna enjoyed the combination of pineapple, dragonfruit and raspberry, especially in smoothie form, as it was an easy way to get in some fruit.\n\nMint chip with Swiss chard, banana and almond butter: This was one of Anna's favorite smoothies, as it tasted like a chocolate-mint dessert. She especially appreciated the extra iron and fiber.\n\nThis one tasted like a chocolate-mint dessert. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nHidden greens smoothie with kale, almond butter and banana: Anna preferred this greens smoothie over the Power Greens one, as the vanilla and cinnamon gave it a sweeter, less savory flavor.\n\nCacao almond smoothie with almond butter, vanilla and cacao: This was another smoothie Anna enjoyed with its simple ingredients and sweeter flavor profile.\n\nNoodle and grain bowls\n\nKimchi fried quinoa: This dish was a good source of fiber and protein, but it was Anna's least favorite out of the three she tried. It was just a bit too spicy for her personal taste.\n\nThe kimchi fried quinoa was a bit too spicy for Anna's taste. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nFried tofu korma with peas: Reheated cooked tofu is often chewy and tough. Unfortunately, Splendid Spoon hasn't solved the puzzle.\n\nCreamy mushroom and spinach noodles: This rich noodle dish was 100% dairy-free but still satisfied my craving for a creamy alfredo.\n\nI reheated most of Splendid Spoon's rice and noodle bowls in a nonstick skillet, which I find gets better results than the microwave. David Watsky/CNET\n\nCoconut curry rice: This was really tasty. Anna found that the rice was nicely cooked, chickpeas and greens were a great addition, and the curry sauce was delicious. This was also a good source of fiber and iron.\n\nPurple grain bowl: In addition to loving this dish's punny name, I enjoyed its ingredients: chickpeas, cauliflower, red cabbage and tricolor quinoa.\n\nThe purple grain bowl, which is as tasty as it is punny. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nKale-pesto noodles with roasted tomatoes and vegan meatballs: A flavorful vegan pesto over al dente noodles. One of the better noodle bowls I tried.\n\nWild rice ragout: Anna liked the mix of grains (wild rice and quinoa), which paired nicely with the veggies and tomato sauce. It was also low in calories, fat and carbs.\n\nSplendid Spoon's wild rice and veggie ragout. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nDan dan noodles with bok choy and peppercorn: This noodle dish was packed with Sichuan flavors and had nice heat. The noodles were chewy and not mushy, just the way I like them.\n\nTofu teriyaki grain bowl: This tofu, brown rice and broccoli meal has a very light coating of teriyaki sauce, which makes it taste a lot healthier than other teriyaki meals I've had.\n\nThe tofu teriyaki veggie bowl had a light coating of sauce, giving it a fresher, less heavy flavor. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nSoups\n\nCauliflower tikka soup: I really liked this one. Light but full of warm Indian spice. Anna agrees.\n\nSpiced lentil and chickpea soup: Solid but not terribly flavorful for a soup that is billed as \"spiced.\"\n\nGarden minestrone soup: Filled with tomatoes, zucchini and kale, this soup tasted fresh and offered a nice mix of ingredients.\n\nThe garden minestrone soup is packed with veggies and greens. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nFennel consommé with dill: The bright fennel was overpowering and the only thing I could taste. I didn't enjoy this one very much.\n\nButternut turmeric soup: While the flavor was good (the orange zest was especially fun), Anna does wish this soup had more ingredients to make it heartier and more filling.\n\nSplendid Spoon's butternut turmeric soup is made even better with the orange zest. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nLentil kale soup: A delicious mix of lentils, kale and spices, this soup packed a flavorful punch.\n\nRed lentil dal soup: This 350-calorie soup was a good source of fiber (10g) and protein (17g) while offering a comforting flavor.\n\nA comforting, hearty dal. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nTomato quinoa chili: Tasty and satisfying, this was low-calorie at 290 calories and not as salty as some chili can be,\n\nGreen split pea soup: Tarragon and mint gave this soup a unique flavor different from other pea soups Anna has tried. It was also a good source of potassium and iron.\n\nThe tarragon and mint were nice additions. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nCauliflower potato soup: Anna was expecting this soup to be bland, but was pleasantly surprised by the addition of great northern beans, which added flavor and made the soup more filling.\n\nKabocha congee soup: While this soup was tasty, it was high in saturated fat (75% of the daily value) likely caused by the addition of coconut milk. However, if you're following the Five-Day Detox exactly, this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBeans and greens soup: As promised in the title, this was a great mix of beans and greens. Another hearty soup.\n\nSplendid Spoon's beans and greens soup is a great way to get in your greens. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nBlack eye pea stew: A good source of iron, the black eyed peas in this stew were especially tasty.\n\nMasala khichri soup: Anna loved this soup with the addition of okra. The rice made it feel hearty and wholesome.\n\nThe okra was perfection. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nButternut ratatouille soup: The tomato broth paired nicely with the butternut squash and kale.\n\nOats\n\nGolden milk oats: This was previously the only oat-based dish in the ,detox and Anna thought it was tasty, especially with the addition of blackberries, almonds and cardamom.\n\nStrawberry milkshake oats: Made with coconut milk, strawberries and monk fruit extract, this oat dish tasted like a heartier version of a strawberry milkshake.\n\nThe strawberry milkshake oats actually tasted like a strawberry milkshake. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nCarrot cake oats: Along with carrots, these oats contain applesauce, pineapples, golden raisins and walnuts to create a filling and delicious morning meal.\n\nBlueberry almond oats: Anna loved the addition of lemon and almond butter in these oats. The lemon, in particular, brought a brightness to the dish.\n\nThe lemon perfectly complemented the blueberry in the blueberry almond oats. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nCherry berry oats: This was another tasty oat meal made even more fruity by the addition of strawberries and raspberries.\n\nWellness shots, various: My order came with five free wellness shots. I especially liked the watermelon, beet and ginger \"recovery\" shot, but all of them were tasty and went down smoothly. Anna also enjoyed her five wellness shots as part of the Five-Day Detox plan. She especially liked the blackberry-elderberry Immunity Shot and ginger-orange-lemon Wellness Shot.\n\nThe ginger paired nicely with the orange and lemon. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nHow to prepare Splendid Spoon meals\n\nThe drinks come completely ready to drink. They're also good to pop into the freezer if you need more time to get through them. The soups and bowls can be microwaved but I suggest reheating them gently in a saucepan or nonstick skillet. This method always produces more even heating and reduces the chance that you'll overcook the food.\n\nAnna's soups instructed her to rinse the package under warm water for about 30 seconds but sometimes it took more than that. After, she popped the soup in a microwave-safe dish and microwaved while covering for the recommended amount of time.\n\nWhat the Splendid Spoon soup packaging looks like. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nIs Splendid Spoon healthy?\n\nOur wellness editor found her meals to be healthy with no surprising nutrition facts. However, she emphasizes that anyone who is changing their diet in any way or planning to detox should speak with their doctor beforehand.\n\nWho is Splendid Spoon good for?\n\nBecause the food is truly ready to eat, Splendid Spoon is perfect for anyone looking to cut cooking -- or even blending -- completely out of the equation for a few meals per week.\n\nThe food is all gluten-free and vegan, making it a good choice for anyone following those diets. The portions aren't huge, so if you're trying to cut total calories per week, this meal delivery service might help. Splendid Spoon is also very Whole30-friendly if you're looking to eat less processed food and meals with more natural ingredients.\n\nThe wild rice and veggie ragout nutrition facts Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nThis is also a good option for habitual smoothie and juice drinkers looking to mix up their recipes and flavors but who don't feel like shopping for all the ingredients needed to make them.\n\nAnna agrees. For those looking for a detox program, the Five-Day Detox could potentially be a good option, as long as you speak with your doctor about it beforehand to make sure you're getting what you need from this plan. For instance, some may not get enough calories, as these plans are not one-size-fits-all.\n\nWho is Splendid Spoon not as good for?\n\nIf you have a smoothie routine that you have down to a science, the Splendid Spoon smoothies might feel like a slight downgrade. Yes, you'll taste new recipes and interesting flavor combinations but they're more like juices in texture.\n\nBecause the food is all vegan, this isn't a good pick for anyone who craves meat for breakfast and lunch or other protein-dense foods such as eggs. Because a lot of the smoothies contain fruit (sugar) and the bowls have grains, beans and noodles, this isn't the ideal meal delivery for someone keeping to a low-carb or keto plan, either.\n\nHow much does Splendid Spoon cost?\n\nSmoothies are $9.99 per serving; soups are $12.49; noodles and other dishes are $13.49; oats are $5.49; and each shot is $4.25. Shipping is an extra $10. With the 12-meal plan, you get $10 off to cover shipping, while the 18-meal plan offers $20 off, so you get free shipping and an extra $10 off.\n\nSplendid Spoon pricing is on par with plant-based competitors like Daily Harvest. My favorite plant-based meal delivery service, Mosaic Foods, is a few bucks cheaper at about $12 per meal.\n\nWhat Splendid Spoon looks like when it arrives. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nPackaging and eco-friendliness\n\nThe smoothies and wellness shots are all packaged in recyclable plastic. The soup bowls are made of post-consumer recycled plastic that can be rinsed and put in the recycling bin. As for the grain and noodle bowl trays, you can peel the plastic away from the cardboard and recycle the cardboard. The liner can be rinsed and may be accepted for recycling at your local recycling center (call to confirm).\n\nSplendid Spoon also uses dry ice instead of ice packs, which are rarely fully recyclable. The cooler box is also made from recyclable materials. Pound for pound, this is one of the most eco-friendly meal delivery services I've tested.\n\nThe Splendid Spoon Five-Day Detox frozen meals in Anna's freezer. Anna Gragert/CNET\n\nShould you try Splendid Spoon? Our final verdict\n\nIn my second go-round with Splendid Spoon, my feelings about the healthy subscription service remain largely unchanged (hey, there's something to be said for consistency). Splendid Spoon smoothies, soups and meals are solid and mostly good but rarely great, made from healthy ingredients and largely free of allergens. There are enough recipe options to keep things interesting, with plenty of flavor combos for adventurous and safe eaters alike. At $4 to $13 per serving, Splendid Spoon feels pricey for a single smoothie or soup, and the better value can be had by ordering more full meals, such as the vegan, gluten-free noodles and rice bowls.\n\nAnna agrees. Although she didn't follow the Five-Day Detox program she received, she did try all the meals and smoothies and found them to be tasty. However, anyone looking to follow any sort of detox program should consult their doctor first.\n\nSplendid Spoon vs. the competition\n\nDaily Harvest vs. Splendid Spoon\n\nIf you don't mind a few minutes of smoothie prep, I might recommend Daily Harvest, which sends all the ingredients diced, frozen and ready to be blended with milk. If it's just the soups and bowls you're after, Splendid Spoon has a host of pleasant lunches or light dinners to choose from each week. They arrive fresh and ready to be eaten or popped in the freezer, saving you precious time during the morning and afternoon.\n\nMosiac Foods vs. Splendid Spoon\n\nFor bigger eaters looking for full meals that are more dinner-friendly, there are better plant-based services out there. Mosaic Foods is my No. 1 pick, featuring more interesting food for a slightly lower price per meal (and even cheaper if you choose family meals). Mosaic Foods recipes were more interesting and the food was very filling and well-prepared."

            "content": "If you have an Oura Ring, then you're likely familiar with Oura Advisor, the company's in-app AI chatbot that can answer questions about your health. Now, Oura, the maker of the smart ring, has launched its first proprietary AI model, like Oura Advisor, but specifically for women.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company announced that it would eventually launch this new women's health AI model within Oura Advisor to answer questions about menopause, the menstrual cycle, fertility and more. But as of right now, it's currently in testing under the app's Oura Labs tab.\n\n“This custom model is a fundamental shift in how we responsibly deploy AI in health to meet the needs of our members,” Ricky Bloomfield, Oura's chief medical officer, said in a press release. “Women’s health is too complex -- and too often overlooked -- to rely on one-size-fits-all systems. By designing a model specifically for women and grounding it in trusted clinical science and real-world biometric data, we’re setting the standard for how responsible intelligence should be built and expanded across more areas of health.\"\n\nWhat the new AI model testing looks like in Oura Labs. Oura\n\nHow this new women's health AI model was designed\n\nCreated by Oura's own team of board-certified doctors and women’s health experts, the new AI model is the company's first custom large language model, built using Oura Advisor's generative AI and Oura's biometric tracking and health-sensing algorithms. So, when a women's health question is asked, this new model is able to comb through its curated women’s health research library while analyzing the data collected by the user's Oura Ring to provide evidence-based answers.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, this new version of Oura Advisor was created to answer questions in a supportive way that doesn't dismiss the user's concerns.\n\nChris Curry, clinical director of women’s health at Oura and a board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, adds in the press release that this model aims to help people prepare for appointments with their doctors: \"For example, if someone asks, ‘Why has my cycle suddenly become irregular, and is that something to worry about?’ Oura Advisor can walk them through what’s typical, what their data may be showing and what would be most helpful to surface in conversations with their provider.\"\n\nOura, AI and privacy\n\nThis women's health AI model is currently available only for testing and feedback in Oura Labs, for which participation is optional. Even if you opt in, you can always opt out. Oura also states that it will never sell or rent your health data, and won't share your sensitive information without your consent.\n\nOura has outlined a future vision for what it calls “private AI,” which means all AI insights are processed and generated only on your device. The company also partners with webAI, an AI tech company that Oura describes as a \"platform for intelligence to operate securely, scale autonomously and evolve with users’ needs.\" Some of its processes, such as population-level algorithms, may use cloud or hybrid architectures when it makes sense for the task at hand.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 26: This story initially contained incorrect information about Oura's privacy policy. Oura's \"private AI\" is not a current feature, but is a future vision the company has outlined. Right now, AI insights are still processed in the cloud."

            "content": "There's a lot your smart ring or fitness tracker can do from your finger or wrist, but there is still certain information you have to manually log yourself in the app. Think meals you've eaten or the exact type of exercise you've completed. Until now.\n\nOn Thursday, health tech company Luna announced that its Luna Ring Gen 2 became the world's first smart ring you can talk to about your health. This is thanks to Luna Voice and the company's AI engine, LifeOS, which is powered by Gemini and compatible with Siri, meaning only Apple users can use this feature.\n\nAs the Luna Ring Gen 2 is the only ring the brand currently sells, it is the only one available with Luna Voice.\n\nCNET spotted this technology at CES 2026, when Luna unveiled its Luna Band, a wristband health tracker similar to the Whoop 5.0 in that it doesn't have a screen. Like the Luna Ring, the band can also use your voice and its AI engine to track your health information.\n\nLuna Voice is compatible with Siri and will answer your health questions through compatible earbuds or a smartphone. Luna\n\nNow, you can tell your smart ring when you eat a meal, take a supplement, drink a cup of coffee or when you just went for a run, so it knows what type of activity it picked up from your finger. You can also ask it questions about your health, and it will respond through a compatible smartphone or earbuds.\n\nYou won't need to open your app to add this information yourself, giving you one fewer screen to check.\n\n“This marks a fundamental shift in what a wearable is,” Luna founder Amit Khatri said in a press release. “The Luna Ring no longer just measures the body. It understands context, connects daily behavior with biometrics and communicates back in a way that fits naturally into real life.”\n\nIn a world full of screens, not having to log data your smart ring can't track is a welcome sight. Luna\n\nPlus, unlike other smart rings and wearables, the Luna Ring doesn't come with a subscription fee. Perhaps this is its greatest selling point.\n\nHere's the catch\n\nWhile the Luna Ring Gen 2 is priced at $329, it's not available in the US right now. This is a recent development, as on Nov. 19, Oura, makers of the Oura Ring, filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against Samsung, Reebok (for the Reebok Smart Ring), Zepp Health (for the Amazfit ring) and Nexxbase (owners of the Luna Ring), stating that the companies are unlawfully importing and selling products that infringe on Oura Ring patents.\n\nOn Jan. 8, Luna Ring maker Nexxbase consented, stating that it would voluntarily stay out of the US.\n\nA representative for Luna told CNET that it is working toward once again making the ring available in the US in the next couple of months. As for the Luna Band, presales will go live in April with the launch planned for the end of May."

And I've used them all, including Apple's iPhone 17 Pro and Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra. And while they're both great phone cameras for most people, Xiaomi and Leica's latest collaboration has resulted in a handset that's arguably more camera than it is phone.\n\nThe Leica Leitzphone powered by Xiaomi -- to use its full official name -- is Xiaomi's latest flagship Android phone, developed in partnership with the iconic German camera brand Leica. You can buy the standard Xiaomi 17 Ultra in a more conventional form, with minimal Leica branding. But it's the Leitzphone version that has the photographer in me buzzing like a hive of bees that just heard honey prices are set to soar.\n\nThe Leica Leitzphone by Xiaomi is notable for prioritizing the photography experience above nearly everything else. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nBut why? Well, it bears the Leica red dot logo, has Leica etching on the sides, a host of Leica filmic color styles to shoot with and it has a function hardware wheel on the back of the phone that actually turns to control camera settings. It'll even be sold in Leica's own physical stores here in the UK.\n\nMix in its supercharged processor and the glorious display and this phone becomes an all-round powerhouse that's well-deserving of its flagship title. I've taken thousands of photos while testing with the Leitzphone, and I am stunned by the results I've achieved. Its images aren't just \"good for a phone;\" they're downright superb for any camera, which is why it was an easy decision to award the phone a coveted CNET Editors' Choice award.\n\nIt costs £1,700 in the UK, which converts to roughly $2,300 (though it won't be officially sold in the US), so it doesn't come cheap, but nothing with a Leica logo does. However, if you're looking for the ultimate imaging experience in a phone, pay attention. Let's dive in deeper and take a look at the most important part: the camera.\n\nXiaomi Leitzphone: Camera quality\n\nThis phone is all about the camera, so if you're simply not that bothered about photography, then check out our other favorite Android phones. Maybe take a peek at our early coverage of Samsung's new Galaxy S26 range. Those of you still here and lusting after amazing photos on the go: strap in, you're in for a treat.\n\nThe phone's main camera uses something called a LOFIC image sensor, which stands for Lateral Overflow Integration Capacitor (in case you were curious). It's basically a brand-new sensor technology designed to deliver much better dynamic range in a single image. That's helped, too, by the sensor's large size and the high-quality Leica Summilux lens sitting in front of it.\n\nThe phone's telephoto zoom lens has moving lens elements, allowing it to achieve a continuous zoom from 75- to 100-millimeter focal lengths, rather than relying on digital cropping. And to control it all, there's a big lens ring on the back that actually turns to control the zoom, or as I've set mine to, the exposure compensation.\n\nBut it's not just the hardware that's impressive here; the Leitzphone has the exact same color profiles that you'll find on Leica's actual cameras and film. It all makes this handset the best-equipped camera phone, ahead of any of its rivals. And it's why I've shot somewhere just north of 2,000 photos on it so far during my testing.\n\nEnlarge Image Taken with the main camera in the Leica Chrome color profile, I love how this pigeon has been frozen in action, with pleasing contrast throughout the image. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nEnlarge Image Using the 8x hybrid zoom I was able to fill the frame with these seagulls. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nEnlarge Image The Chrome color profile resulted in beautiful tones in this image. I love being able to quickly snap away at low angles using a phone. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nEnlarge Image Those small pops of color from the climbing hold really contrast well against the gray wall. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nImages are packed with detail and glorious colors, especially when using the Leica Chrome color profile. I love how rich the photos are, with deep, natural shadows that are increasingly rare these days in images from other phones. Some of Xiaomi's rivals go way overboard with image processing, attempting to lighten shadows so much that it kills much of the image's drama. But that's not the case here: The Leitzphone can take images that serious photographers will genuinely love.\n\nBut you'll have to put in some work, too. I'll often shoot in Pro mode, twisting the control ring to manually underexpose the image to emphasize the shadows and create mood in my images. Or I'll shoot in high-contrast black-and-white mode for a punchy look that's perfect for high-impact street photography. I actually love dabbling in street photography, and a lot of my personal work on \"regular\" cameras is in a similar high-contrast black-and-white style, so it has been great fun using the phone in much the same way.\n\nEnlarge Image Shot in high-contrast black-and-white mode, I used the roof to frame the bird, exposing for the bright sky to cast the subject into deep shadow and create a dramatic silhouette. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nEnlarge Image I love black-and-white street photography, and using a phone is a great way of capturing candid moments without being noticed. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nEnlarge Image Unlike many of its rivals, the Leitzphone doesn't try to artificially lift shadows. As a result, images like this maintain the depth and drama that I wanted to capture when I took the photo. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nWhat surprised me about this phone is how similar my workflow has been to my regular shooting style with my own Leica Q3 43. I almost always shoot using the Chrome profile on my Q3 43, as I adore the tones it delivers, and I'll typically underexpose a shot to achieve the same rich shadows. The Leitzphone works exactly the same way, and I've been really pleased with how closely those colors match between the phone and the camera.\n\nThere's also a mode that mimics a roll of Leica's Monopan 50 black-and-white film. I've shot a few rolls of that on both Pentax and Leica film cameras and the results are pretty similar to what the phone achieves, with comparable contrast and film grain. If you love shooting monochrome images, you'll love taking this thing out and about.\n\nThe camera's exposure and colors remain excellent at night, too, especially when using the Chrome style, which I honestly feel should just be the default; it looks so good. Details do get quite mushy at night, but unless you're really pixel peeping, it's unlikely to be much of a problem.\n\nEnlarge Image This night-time scene overlooking London's St. Paul's Cathedral is pin-sharp with a perfect exposure. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nEnlarge Image Zooming in using the telephoto lens, this night shot of a pub front has beautiful tones. I used the Chrome color profile, which helps add a deeper tone to the orange in the windows. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nIs the camera quality as good as my actual Leica camera? No, of course not -- my Q3's lens and full-frame image sensor definitely produce better, more natural-looking images. But it's a professional camera that costs me thousands of pounds more than the phone costs, so I'd be pretty mad if my real Leica couldn't hold its own against even the best phone.\n\nEnlarge Image Taken using the 200-megapixel mode (although resized here for easier viewing online), this image looks fine when seen in its entirety. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nEnlarge Image But zoom in to 100% and it's clear that while there's a lot of resolution, there's not actually any more detail. What we have instead is a sort of watercolor effect where the image processing is trying to smooth out and sharpen details that it hasn't captured. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nThere is evidently plenty of software processing still going on behind the scenes on the Leitzphone, with some shots showing too much noise reduction and digital sharpening for my taste. There's a 200 megapixel mode that creates an enormous image but the fine details often become a weird sort of watercolor painting, so I don't really see the point in adding extra resolution when it's not actually adding any extra detail.\n\nSo it's not perfect as such, but it's still probably the best camera phone I've ever used and certainly the one I'd most want in my pocket on a photography outing.\n\nXiaomi Leica Leitzphone: Processor, software and battery life\n\nThankfully, the rest of the phone is pretty good, too. It runs Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor, which delivers swift navigation and tons of power for playing demanding games like Genshin Impact. It performed well on our processor benchmark tests, putting it up there with other Gen 5-equipped phones like the OnePlus 15 or Honor Magic 8 Pro.\n\nLeica Leitzphone performance comparison Leica Leitzphone by Xiaomi 3,609 10,784 iPhone 17 Pro Max 3,907 10,023 OnePlus 15 3,670 11,061 Geekbench 6 (single core)\n\nGeekbench 6 (multi-core) Note: Longer bars equals better performance\n\nThe 6.9-inch OLED display is bright and vibrant and the phone's IP68 rating means you can take it out in the rain without any worry about water damage.\n\nThe Leitzphone (left) has a custom interface with monochrome tiles. You can change theme if you want, or you can buy the standard Xiaomi 17 Ultra (right), which doesn't have it at all. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nThe Leitzphone runs Android 16 and comes with a custom interface with Leica-esque monochrome app icons and wallpapers. I actually don't love it because I struggle to tell which app is which without color cues. But I easily swapped it for a different theme. While Xiaomi provides a few AI tools and features, including a translation tool, its AI is mostly just the usual Google add-ons like Gemini Advanced and Circle to Search. I'm extremely grateful that Xiaomi has focused on delivering an amazing experience across the phone, without relying on AI gimmicks. Samsung could take note.\n\nThe Leitzphone has a 6,000-mAh battery, which is decent, but not quite up there with the best. It dropped from full to 85% remaining after our three-hour video streaming test, which is a solid effort, though it didn't quite beat the 90% or more achieved by the OnePlus 15 or iPhone 17 Pro Max. Still, you won't struggle to get a full day of mixed use from it.\n\nI found I could rinse the poor thing from full to around 60% remaining with half a day of constant photography use, so if you're heading out for a day of photography on your vacation it's worth carrying a battery pack to help keep some power for the evening. Or keep a fast charger in your bag -- it supports wired charging up to 90W-speeds with a compatible charger, so even a short boost will be enough to give a few hours of use back. If you're using it as a more regular phone, with some photography every so often then you can comfortably get through a full day -- with lighter use I've had as much as half the battery remaining at the end of a day.\n\nThe Leica Leitzphone next to my Leica Q3 43. They're a good match. Andrew Lanxon/CNET\n\nXiaomi Leica Leitzphone: Should you buy it?\n\nThe main reason to spend big on this phone is its stellar camera setup. So if you're not that into photography, then this is easily one to skip. Or at least you might want to look at the regular Xiaomi 17 Ultra, which strips out some of the Leica-branded stuff and the settings wheel but keeps much of the other hardware, including the LOFIC sensor and telephoto zoom. It should come with a lower price tag as a result. Camera stuff aside, the Leitzphone and the 17 Ultra are on par with any other Android flagship you'll find right now.\n\nBut for those of you who really take your photography seriously and want the ultimate camera phone, complete with that iconic red dot, the Leitzphone is absolutely worth considering. No Leica comes cheap, and this one is no exception, but that high price comes with the reassurance that you'll always have a camera with you capable of capturing the images you truly want to take.\n\nHow we test phones\n\nEvery phone CNET's reviews team tests is used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools such as GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\n\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions, from bright sunlight to dark indoor enviornments. We try out special features such as night mode and portrait mode, and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily, as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\n\nWe take into account additional features including support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether the phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances."
