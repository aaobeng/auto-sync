            "content": "ARSENAL signed Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting Lisbon for an initial fee of £54.8million rising to £63.5m.\n\nBut at the end of this season, the Gunners could already have handed over an extra £3.5m in add-ons, meaning they will have so far paid paid £58.3m for the forward.\n\n\n\nArsenal are close to coughing up a further €500,000 (£436,000) as it relates to the number of goals and assists Gyokeres scores for Arsenal.\n\n\n\nSporting are due €500,000 (£436,000) every time the striker hits 20 goals and assists combined.\n\nGyokeres currently has 15 goals and two assists, meaning Arsenal are not far off having to pay out.\n\nSporting will be due another €500,000 (£436,000) if Gyokeres chips in with another 20 goals and assists combined.\n\nBut that will be the final payout related to that add-on because it is capped at €1m (£873,000).\n\n\n\nSporting have already had their bank balance boosted by Arsenal this season after Gyokeres made 20 appearances of 45 minutes or more.\n\nThat led to the Gunners paying €1.25m (£1.1m), with the total payout for that add-on capped at €5m (£4.4m).\n\nGyokeres needs to make 80 appearances of 45 minutes or more for Arsenal to pay the full amount.\n\nSUN VEGAS WELCOME OFFER: GET £50 BONUS WHEN YOU JOIN\n\nThe former Brighton and Coventry forward has so far made 30 appearances of 45 minutes or more, so needs to feature in another 10 games for the next pay-out.\n\n\n\nArsenal have at least 14 games left – 10 in the Premier League, one in the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup final and two Champions League ties – so that amount could be reached this term.\n\nThe final add-on of the Gyokeres deal relates to Arsenal qualifying for the Champions League.\n\nEach time the Gunners qualify, Sporting will bank €1m (£874,000), but that is capped at €4m (£3.5m).\n\nThis is why at the end of the season, Arsenal could have so far paid £58.3m.\n\nBut if Gyokeres keeps playing – and scoring – they will be happy to hand over the cash.\n\n\n\nEurotrip\n\nPREMIER LEAGUE clubs usually travel all over the world for pre-season tours, but Arsenal will stay closer to home this summer.\n\nThe Gunners are finalising their pre-season plans but are expected to stay in Europe.\n\nArsenal went to Asia last year and have previously travelled to the USA as well.\n\nBut the World Cup being in the States – and the fact it runs until mid July – means Mikel Arteta’s side will keep travel to a minimum.\n\n\n\nArsenal are looking at playing two friendlies in Europe – with Dublin one city being considered.\n\nThe Gunners have played in Dublin before, taking on Chelsea in a friendly at the Aviva Stadium eight years ago.\n\nArsenal are expected to have much of their squad away at the World Cup, which has also impacted their decision to look at a smaller pre-season tour.\n\nPlayers will be due a break after the World Cup and may not return to training until August.\n\nThe Premier League is due to start a week later next season on August 22.\n\n\n\nThis allows for 89 clear days from the end of the current season and 33 days from the World Cup final.\n\nA ‘bootiful’ moment\n\nA TEENAGE Arsenal fan enjoyed a dream North London Derby after Bukayo Saka gifted him his boots.\n\nOrlando Alexander, 13, was in the away end at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for the Gunners’ thumping 4-1 win.\n\nOrlando was there with his dad, David, who surprised him with tickets on the day of the game.\n\n\n\nThe pair are season ticket holders at the Emirates – but this was Orlando’s first time being with the away fans.\n\nIt was a dream afternoon for the youngster, whom Saka picked out at the end of the match before handing him his boots.\n\nOrlando – who is a winger himself for Ware Youth FC Under-14s – now has the boots in his bedroom where they have pride of place.\n\nOrlando told SunSport: “When I got given the boots, it was the best feeling ever.\n\n“I’m an aspiring player myself and looking at them in my room is a real inspiration. Maybe it’s a sign!\n\n\n\n“So many people at my school and even my teachers saw me on Sky and have been celebrating with me.\n\n“What I love most about Bukayo Saka is that as well as being a great player, he is a really nice person and he’s been such a role model for me.\n\n“I hope he pushes on and helps Arsenal win the title this season!”\n\nCelebrate good times\n\nYOU can take the player out of Hale End – but you cannot take Hale End out of the players.\n\nThat seems to be the case for Alex Iwobi and Emile Smith Rowe, who celebrated Arsenal’s win over Spurs while on the bus back from Fulham’s victory at Sunderland.\n\n\n\nThe pair were watching the North London Derby on the coach home and clips of it have gone viral on social media.\n\nFulham defender Ryan Sessegnon, who played for Tottenham, gets plenty of stick from Iwobi and Smith Rowe.\n\nAnd Smith Rowe even celebrated Gyokeres scoring by mimicking the Swedish striker’s famous mask celebration.\n\nSquad games\n\nARTETA has been handed a squad boost for the title run-in after it was made official that no Arsenal player can be suspended for accumulation of yellow cards in the Premier League.\n\n\n\nPlayers who accumulate 10 yellow cards in Prem matches up to and including their side’s 32nd fixture will serve a two-match suspension in the competition.\n\nBut with no Arsenal player currently amassing more than five yellow cards this term, and there being only four games left until that 32nd fixture, Arsenal will avoid any suspensions for yellow card accumulation.\n\nThe Gunners are also yet to receive a red card in the Premier this season and will be hoping to become just the third team in history to win the title without having anyone sent off.\n\nOnly Manchester United (1992-93) and Chelsea (2004-05 and 2016-17) have completed that feat before.\n\n\n\nIt’s a stark change for Arteta’s side, who had previously gained a reputation for a poor disciplinary record during the Spaniard’s first few years in charge at the Emirates.\n\nEll-is of a surprise\n\nJAMES ELLIS leaving his post as Arsenal technical director after just a few months in that job is a surprise.\n\nHe had only been promoted seven months ago, with the intention that he would provide support to new sporting director Andrea Berta.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn fact, he was doing a lot of work for Berta behind the scenes in terms of the academy, dealing with parents and sorting out contracts like Max Dowman’s plus a number of highly-rated youngsters who have joined the club.\n\nEllis, understood to be a strong character, had very clear plans of the direction he wanted to take the academy during the 2026-27 season and that did not seem to align with those above him."

            "content": "DREAM TEAM managers have until 6:30pm on Friday to confirm their transfers for Gameweek 26.\n\nFor the last time this season, every single club is scheduled to play twice with a full round of Premier League fixtures to take place in midweek after the usual weekend action.\n\n\n\nHugo Ekitike (£4.5m)\n\nLiverpool’s double header is the most favourable on paper: West Ham (h) & Wolves (a).\n\n\n\nThese two opponents have conceded 100 league goals between them this season and so the Reds’ current top scorer has to be considered a strong option.\n\nGranted, Ekitike hasn’t done much in his last four outings but he should get his fair share of chances against two vulnerable defences this coming Gameweek.\n\nDream Team’s top midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai (£5.5m) is almost a must-have asset at this stage and, if passed fit as expected, Florian Wirtz (£5.9m) is another viable selection among Arne Slot’s ranks.\n\nAt the back, Virgil van Dijk (£4.7m) is the game’s most in-form defender at present having contributed to three consecutive clean sheets, with a couple of goal involvements thrown in for good measure.\n\nNico O’Reilly (£3.4m)\n\nManchester City also have an enticing double header on paper in the form of Leeds (a) and Nottingham Forest (h).\n\nThe Whites are always competitive at Elland Road and Forest have looked better since Vitor Pereira’s arrival but most Dream Team bosses have every right to expect healthy returns from Pep Guardiola’s troops.\n\nAs the two most popular players in the game, Erling Haaland (£7.2m) and Antoine Semenyo (£4.9m) go without saying as transfer targets for those inexplicably resistant up to this point.\n\n\n\nWith an ownership a shade above 10%, perhaps O’Reilly will be the difference-maker.\n\nThe 20-year-old was City’s hero against Newcastle last weekend; he banked 16 points for his decisive brace.\n\nFormerly a makeshift left-back, the England starlet has been deployed as an advanced midfielder in recent weeks and Guardiola seems happy with the results.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Rayan Ait-Nouri (£4.7m), who currently features in just 2.5% of teams, has earned 51 points from his last seven outings.\n\n\n\nHarry Wilson (£3.6m) or Raul Jimenez (£3.6m)\n\nIf you’re willing to think outside the box then Fulham’s top performers might fit the bill.\n\nThe Cottagers have the luxury of back-to-back home games against Spurs and West Ham, 16th and 18th in the table respectively.\n\nWilson boasts impressive stats of nine goals and eight assists in all competitions this season while Jimenez has scored three goals and provided an assist across the last three Gameweeks — the latter is a faultless penalty taker.\n\nThis wouldn’t need to be a one-week punt either as Fulham’s fixtures throughout March look rather inviting with Southampton (h), Forest (a) and Burnley (h) to follow.\n\nScore Predictor Play Score Predictor with Dream Team this season Free to play\n\nEvery correct prediction earns you one entry into the end-of-season £10,000 prize draw\n\nPlay in Mini Leagues against your mates\n\nPLAY NOW!\n\nIgor Thiago (£3.6m)\n\nBrentford’s No9 has slowed recently with one goal in his last six appearances but it wouldn’t be a surprise if he rediscovered his shooting boots against Burnley (a) and Bournemouth (a).\n\n\n\nThe Cherries pack a punch in attack but their tally of 45 league goals conceded is evidence of a defence shakier than every team in the top flight bar the bottom three and Leeds.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThiago ranks joint-fourth among all players for shots on target this season, an impressive feat given he has played fewer games than all his closest rivals in the metric.\n\nLooking further ahead, the Bees are due to face West Ham (a), Wolves (h) and Leeds (a) before the end of March so their 18-goal striker might be a smart option for the next few Gameweeks."

            "content": "A FORMER Champions League stadium could be demolished due to structural issues.\n\nHajduk Split have been playing their home matches at Stadion Poljud since 1979.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ground is steeped in history as Hajduk celebrated six Croatian league titles in that venue.\n\nThe esteemed club also played four Champions League games at Poljud in the 1994-95 season.\n\nThat was the club’s only appearance in the European competition and saw them making it to the quarter-finals where they were eliminated by Ajax after overcoming Benfica, Steaua Bucharest and Anderlecht.\n\n\n\nAccording to Index, however, the 33,987-seater may soon need to be torn down in order to rebuild an improved version.\n\nProfessor Emeritus Ante Mihanovic, who took part in the venue’s structural design back in 1976, found there’s material fatigue in the steel and reinforced concrete structures.\n\nMihanovic specifically found problems primarily affecting the steel elements of the roof structure and the reinforced concrete sections of the stands.\n\nThus the engineer deemed reconstruction was simply not possible.\n\n\n\nTherefore, Hajduk now face three realistic scenarios regarding their home stadium.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL – BEST CASINO BONUSES FROM £10 DEPOSITS\n\nThe first possible solution would see Poljud undergoing technical maintenance while the club constructs a new facility in the Brodarica district.\n\nThe second would involve a deep reconstruction of the entire venue.\n\nThe third would see the entire structure being demolished before the construction of a modern arena in the same location.\n\nPoljud’s roof was significantly damaged during a storm in July and Mihanovic stressed that the structure no longer meets contemporary safety standards.\n\n\n\nHajduk spokesperson, Bozo Pavkovic said last summer: “The roof at the junction of the southern and western stands has sustained significant damage, with a large number of Lexan panels being blown off or carried away by the wind.\n\n“The condition of the remaining panels on the roof is uncertain, and it is unclear how securely they are still in place. There is a risk of further collapses, so we need to assess what and how to proceed and determine how safe it is.\n\n“The pitch is flooded. It has been damaged. This is especially problematic as we are in the sensitive phase of changing the grass. We now need to see how this will affect the first matches of the new season.\n\n“Several offices have also been damaged, as well as the indoor hall, and the stadium has suffered a power outage.\n\n“It’s uncertain how we will restore the electricity. Overall, the damage is quite significant, and for now, things do not look good.”"

            "content": "SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY risk yet another points deduction if their proposed takeover does not go through – but it won’t impact them until next season.\n\nAccording to EFL rules, if the selling party does not get at least 25 per cent of what it is owed then the club can be docked 15 points.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a consortium led by former poker player James Bord backed out earlier this week, much-maligned owner Dejphon Chansiri is still waiting for someone to be able to pay up.\n\nAdministrators Begbies Traynor are attempting to find a buyer despite nine weeks with Bord, Felix Roemer and Alsharif Faisal Bin Jamil keeping the club afloat.\n\nThey were not able to reduce the huge £47.8million asking price despite relegation to League One being confirmed on Sunday.\n\nWednesday remain on minus points this season having won just one Championship match out of 33.\n\nThey were beaten 2-1 by fierce local rivals Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, having their long-known fate sealed in the worst circumstances over the weekend.\n\nBut now things could continue to spiral if a new buyer can’t be found.\n\nWednesday will start the 2026-27 campaign on -15 if they don’t get someone willing to pay at the 25p per pound rate to creditors.\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nFor Chansiri, that amounts to around £15million, with more needed to go elsewhere.\n\n\n\nAt the moment that may well be a best-case scenario because should the administrators not have an approved owner by next season, there will be no guarantee of being able to carry out matches, and it is a slippery slope.\n\nWednesday have already been docked 18 points for the financial problems that got them into this mess in the first place.\n\nBord and Co had been propping the Owls up since Christmas Eve, paying a non-refundable £2.5million as well as covering around £1million in losses per month.\n\nThey were due to pay again this week to extend the preferred bidder position for another fortnight but pulled out.\n\nThe EFL were going through the owners and directors test with Bord’s group but had not made significant progress.\n\n\n\nJoint administrators Kris Wigfield, Paul Stanley, and Julian Pitts said: “The club has the necessary funding in place to trade through to the end of the current season.\n\n“The withdrawal of this bidder does not mean we are returning to the beginning of the process.”\n\nBin Jamil explained: “The value is significantly less than we have bid.\n\n“We have bid at a significantly higher value than has been reported.\n\n“We have tried to look at in different ways but unfortunately it’s unjustifiable. We are very sad about it.\n\n\n\n“We have pumped significant money into the club, besides the deposit, and paid for numerous advisors, so there are a lot of sunk costs.\n\n“But unfortunately we have to pull out. We are incredibly sad, as we believe this club is football royalty.\n\n“There is no way to continue the process and get the valuation to a place where there is a fair price.”\n\nHe continued: “We bid a lot higher than £30million.\n\n“That figure is not in the same ball park as our bid.\n\n\n\n“But just because we can’t wrestle with the valuation, it doesn’t discount that somebody else can bid at £30m and I have already wished the administrators luck in finding someone who will.\n\n“Time will tell but I wouldn’t be so hasty to say that somebody can’t hit that number, because avoiding a 15-point deduction is so important for the club and the fans.”\n\nMike Ashley and the Storch family are among potential suitors to save Wednesday.\n\nThe Storch family maintain their interest in the deal, saying: “We remain incredibly passionate about the opportunity at Sheffield Wednesday and seeing the club return to its former glory.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“We wish the preferred bidder well through the process but are ready to step in should the opportunity present itself again.\n\n\n\n“We know all are disappointed by relegation yet wish the team well as they finish the current season.”"

Maguire, 32, sees his current deal expire in June, putting him on course to become a free agent.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe defender has been ever present since Michael Carrick's appointment as interim manager, starting all six games and helping the Red Devils keep three clean sheets. But no decision has been made over his future, with the clock ticking down on his £190,000 per week contract.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the Mail, Bruce sees no reason why Maguire shouldn't be given an extension. \"I wouldn't be surprised if he gets offered a new deal,\" the former United captain said.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Why wouldn't you? I think centre-halves get better with age. I wouldn't be surprised if he went to the World Cup either.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

And he's given a reminder of just what he's about over the last five, six weeks in particular, if he ever needed to.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBruce also argued that the ex-Leicester star has been made a scapegoat at Old Trafford. \"I believe Harry has been made the whipping boy for too long,\" the three-time Premier League winner went on to say.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever let Man United down. In that fact, he's never let England down either. As I said, I think he became a whipping boy for what was going on around him.\"\n\nMaguire was initially due to be out of contract last season before United triggered a one-year extension clause. With Casemiro confirmed to be leaving this summer, the Red Devils will be reluctant to lose any more experience.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBACK THE MIRROR!

The 32-year-old is evidently in favour under Carrick, but a coach who employs a different style - such as a high defensive line - may well prefer centre-backs with more pace than Maguire, whose strengths are in other areas.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFor now, though, Carrick is the favourite to become the Red Devils' next permanent boss. Bruce added: \"Look, he's put himself in pole position, even after six weeks.\n\n\"He's been quite refreshing in his way and the one thing I've said about him, he understands Man United. I don't mean that disrespectfully at all to anybody coming in, but you don't realise how big a club it is and how the scrutiny on you is like no other.\n\n\"As soon as you walk in there, you're in the spotlight; everything is analysed and he understands the club that way after playing for it for 13 years, this cool, calm demeanour that he's got.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

That is the warning from Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Maheta Molango, who fears the biggest stars are being put at risk because they are playing too many games.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea star Palmer has struggled for form and suffered injuries this season which has restricted him to playing just 19 games out of a possible 42. Palmer played a full season in 2023-24, then went to the Euros in 2024 and did not get a proper break last summer as he played for Chelsea in the Club World Cup.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat has left Palmer in serious danger of missing this summer’s World Cup with England because he has not made Thomas Tuchel’s squad since last June. Molango revealed he has paid a visit to Chelsea’s training ground earlier this season and he fears it is going to get even worse for more players, claiming that football has reached saturation point.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTalking at the FT Live event, Molango said: “For us the concern is, of course, player welfare because for me when I look at someone like Cole Palmer.

Martinez, who will oversee the former Sporting midfielder at this summer's World Cup, considers much of the criticism directed at him unjustified.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking on The Overlap, Martinez said: \"I think he's very unfairly assessed. I think if we are all very objective, to be the captain of Manchester United in the last three or four years, I bet it's been incredibly tough at every level.\n\n\"What I appreciate from him is that he never hides.

The midfielder has been a star for the La Liga giants since joining them from Club Atletico Penarol back in the summer of 2017.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring his time at the Santiago Bernabeu, Valverde has won three La Ligas, two Champions Leagues and one Copa del Rey. And even though the 27-year-old has given no indication that he wants to leave the Spanish capital this summer, former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Gus Poyet would love to see the Reds make a move for the midfielder, as he believes he would be the perfect partner for Alexis Mac Allister.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I would love to see Federico Valverde play in England,” he told Betwright. \"Since Fabinho left Liverpool, they’ve lacked a world-class box-to-box midfielder.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Alexis Mac Allister has shown his class this season, but he could use some defensive reinforcement alongside him and someone who can change the game at both ends of the pitch.

Kogan, making his first public appearance at the FT Live event, said: “Alongside the success story of English football, the current system bakes in risk.\n\n“Multiple clubs throughout the pyramid have told us they would not be able to survive a month if their owners pulled funding for one month. Players' wages have been rocketing across the whole of the pyramid. We cannot continue to finance this arms race.\n\n“And relegation for many is a near-death sentence. Clubs facing relegation could see their revenues cut by up to 80 per cent if they fail to bounce back quickly.\n\n“The whole pyramid is facing a series of cliff edges that people talk about, but they have not been addressed. Despite all the money coming in for media rights deals and all the other forms of income that are now coming in, increasingly not for media rights deals, you've still got a pyramid that is riven with debt and riven with risk.”\n\nArsenal told team that can stop them winning the Champions League ahead of last 16 draw READ MORE :\n\nJohn Terry's manager stance backed up after making Chelsea frustration public READ MORE :\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Prem clubs currently pay 16 per cent of their TV broadcast revenues to the pyramid, with the EFL pushing for 25 per cent and the end of parachute payments.\n\nChampionship club Wednesday has been left on the brink after a takeover deal fell through and Kogan fears that will be an increasing concern. Kogan added: “If you want an example of why we exist, well, it's only got to look at the situation in the last 24 hours at Sheffield Wednesday. This is one of the largest, most prestigious names in English football, one of the founders of English football, one of the founders of the Premier League, that has spent the last two or three years in absolute chaos, including yesterday.\n\nView 2 Images EFL clubs are looking for a greater share of the TV revenue (Image: Carl Recine/Getty Images)\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\n“We have real powers to intervene if football cannot reach agreement, the so-called backstop clause. It would be an utter failure by football not to seize the moment and get over the stasis that currently exists. A deal done in 2019, which is the last time a deal was done, that simply relies rolling over year by year to no one's satisfaction, is not sensible practice and it will lead to unsustainable levels of pressure within the system.\n\n“It's to everyone's benefit for football to try and reach this understanding. My message is that the pyramid needs to survive as it exists today. And to do that, English football must come together and end this uncertainty. And it needs to do it now.\n\n“But if the leagues can't find a new deal, those powers will be enacted. And we will be looking at things such as the current mechanism for parachute payments, the cliff edges and the other features of the existing deal. Clearly this has been an ongoing issue between the Premier League and the EFL for the last few years.\n\n“Parachute payments are not an unknown topic, and the level of fiscal imbalance that they may or may not create is an issue that clearly we're going to have to address.”\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The Slovenian shifted through the gears to record a top speed of 35.3 km/h - though his time doesn't even feature amongst the top five quickest Premier League players this season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSesko was trailing Toffees centre-half James Tarkowski as Matheus Cunha carved out space to deliver the ball wide towards Bryan Mbeumo. But the striker's eye-catching surge of pace created a one-on-one opportunity with Jordan Pickford as he collected the pass from Mbeumo before finishing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOpta recorded Sesko's top speed as being faster than his previous quickest time: a dash in the Boxing Day victory over Newcastle United. Nevertheless, whilst the 22-year-old's lightning-quick impression appeared effortless against the Blues, the time registered isn't even United's quickest this campaign.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

But despite his newfound status as a nailed-on starter, his long-term future at Old Trafford remains uncertain.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMainoo, 20, rejected a contract offer from United around this time last year, with Ruben Amorim having then recently been appointed. As Amorim's tumultuous spell in charge continued, the midfielder fell increasingly out of favour.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUntil Amorim was sacked by the Red Devils in January, Mainoo hadn't made a single start in the Premier League this season. The United academy graduate was heavily linked with a departure in the winter transfer window, and Italian giants Napoli were known admirers after failing to land Mainoo in the summer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAfter Carrick was named interim manager, Mainoo was immediately reinstated and has started all six games under his new boss. But this summer, when he could be playing for England at the World Cup, he'll have entered the final 12 months of his current deal - and talks over a renewal are yet to be reopened.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE!

United intend to renew his contract but they haven't formally engaged with his representatives since talks broke down last year.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCrucially, the Red Devils have the option to extend Mainoo's deal by an extra year until 2028. However, the 10-time England international is hoping to earn a new contract which would represent a significant improvement of his relatively modest £25,000-a-week wages.\n\nAs we approach the summer, United won't want to clubs sniffing around Mainoo and turning his head. Chelsea and Bayern Munich have previously been linked with the 20-year-old, who signed professional terms with United in 2023.\n\nThe Red Devils are already set to be one midfielder down when the summer transfer window opens, as Casemiro has confirmed that he'll be leaving upon the expiry of his contract in June. And if Carrick gets the job permanently, there's no doubt that he'll want Mainoo in his squad.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBACK THE MIRROR!

And then, obviously, when I was here the first time, he was in and around a little bit. So, I think knowing him and having experience with him and seeing him perform at such a level on such big occasions...\n\n\"I said earlier about coaches being able to cope with being here and at the level to deal with it. What Kobbie's done at such a young age is quite incredible really.\"\n\nMainoo will be hoping to further his case for a new deal when United host Crystal Palace on Sunday.

Without him, they would be sixth and four points off Liverpool.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Signed for £72m as a promising striker filled with potential just two years earlier, he was pushed out of Old Trafford to make way for Sesko over the summer.\n\nImage: Sesko celebrates his winner in the 1-0 win at Everton\n\nSesko is beginning to show signs he can bear the burden of being United's No. 9 - but three of his five goals have come as a substitute and the other two against promoted-side Burnley, currently second from bottom.\n\nHow Sesko copes when he is the regular starter will be the true test of the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's a lot of pressure,\" Neville said. \"The biggest pressure in English football, that's a Manchester United goalkeeper, but not far behind would be a striker who comes for big money to United.\n\n\"When you come in as a striker with a big price tag, you've got to deliver and he's starting to deliver.\n\n\"There is a danger that maybe that he's sort of getting that super-sub title, but I don't think he's that type. He's a starting player. He has been a super sub in the last few games because he's needed to be.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever going to be the perfect striker, like I said about Gyokeres. But if he can be a handful, contribute with goals, hold things up, link play, that'll be enough. You don't have to be always perfect and [his winner at Everton], it's a big moment for him.\n\n\"If he can get another four or five and finish this season in double figures, in his first season with the struggle that the team were having at the beginning, I think that would be deemed to be a good season.\"\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nSesko faced questions about how he copes with the scrutiny of being United's goalscorer after his winner at Everton as the conversation soon turned to whether he would start at Palace.\n\n\"The pressure is something that, if I want to be a good player, it's something that I have to have,\" Sesko said.\n\n\"It's something that has (to be there) if you want to play at the highest level and it's about accepting it and not really caring about it.\"\n\nSesko has made a strong case to be in from the start against Palace. It is now up to Carrick to decide whether now is the right time to open the door for the young striker.\n\nWatch Man Utd vs Crystal Palace on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, kick-off 2pm"

            "content": "Welcome to The Radar, a Sky Sports column in which Nick Wright uses a blend of data and opinion to shed light on need-to-know stories from up and down the Premier League. This week:\n\n9️⃣ Joao Pedro excelling as Chelsea's striker\n\n🧱 Maguire crucial for Carrick at Man Utd\n\n🔍 Two players to watch this weekend\n\nJoao Pedro's evolution\n\nFew forwards have caused more problems for William Saliba and Gabriel this season than Joao Pedro on his last visit to the Emirates Stadium. The Carabao Cup tie ended in defeat for Chelsea but Joao Pedro returns on Sunday aiming for a repeat performance.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Liam Rosenior gave a candid press conference after Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Burnley\n\nThe 24-year-old spent that evening dragging the Arsenal centre-backs out of position and showing impressive strength to hold them off with his back to goal. He linked the play, ran the channels, won twice as many fouls as anyone else and gave Chelsea an outlet.\n\nAll that was missing was a goal but those have hardly been in short supply lately. Joao Pedro has seven in his last nine appearances for Chelsea. Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres is the only Premier League player to have scored more since the turn of the year.\n\nThe increase in his scoring output, from eight goals in 30 appearances earlier this season to seven in his last nine, coincides with the appointment of Liam Rosenior, who said last week that Joao Pedro can become one of the best strikers in the world.\n\nFanciful, some may say, but there is no doubting the strides he has taken. Joao Pedro's goal against Burnley was his 11th in the Premier League this term. He has reached that total despite losing the penalty-taking privileges he enjoyed at former club Brighton.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Joao Pedro has scored more than twice as many non-penalty goals as in any of his previous top-flight campaigns. Erling Haaland and Antoine Semenyo are the only players with more in the Premier League this season.\n\nHaving split his time between the No 10 and No 9 positions for Brighton, and indeed for Chelsea under Enzo Maresca following his £60m arrival in July, Joao Pedro has been used almost exclusively up front by Rosenior, despite the availability of Liam Delap.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro is spending less time out wide and in his own half, and more in the opposition box\n\nChelsea's last meeting with Arsenal showcased his ability with his back to goal, but overall, Joao Pedro is less involved in general play, averaging fewer touches and fewer passes under Rosenior as the new head coach tries to maximise his threat in the box.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

It has allowed him to have roughly twice as many shots. And while he remains capable of spectacular strikes, like his first goal in the Champions League win over Napoli, he has mostly hunted down easier chances.\n\nHis goal against Burnley, forced over the line from Pedro Neto's cross, was his second from inside the six-yard box under Rosenior and put him on five for the season, the joint-highest total by any player along with Leeds striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\n\nImage: Joao Pedro's shot maps show an increased concentration of close-range chances\n\nHelped, of course, by the better service on offer at Chelsea compared to Brighton, Joao Pedro's shot quality is transformed. Excluding penalties, he has gone from averaging 0.12 expected goals per shot at Brighton last term to 0.21 per shot at Chelsea.\n\nRosenior has challenged Joao Pedro to raise the intensity of his play and he has stepped up on that front too, both in terms of his pressing and his attacking movement. He has increased both the volume and effectiveness of his runs in behind.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

But carry on scoring at the same rate and he will eclipse the totals of those to have come closest in Nicolas Jackson, who scored 14 two seasons ago, and Tammy Abraham, who hit 15 in 2019/20.\n\nArsenal\n\nChelsea Sunday 1st March 4:25pm Kick off 4:30pm\n\nBefore all that, though, there is Sunday's trip to the Emirates Stadium, and another opportunity for a striker establishing himself among the elite to test Saliba and Gabriel.\n\nMaguire key to Man Utd resurgence\n\nBenjamin Sesko is another No 9 catching the eye but Manchester United's resurgence under Michael Carrick owes just as much to their defensive performances. It's three clean sheets in six games so far. The return of Harry Maguire has made a difference.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Premier League match between Everton and Manchester United.\n\nMaguire had not started in two months at the time Carrick's appointment due to a thigh issue but his return to fitness has proved timely for the new head coach. The 32-year-old is in line to start a seventh consecutive game against Crystal Palace on Sunday.\n\nHe has mostly featured alongside Lisandro Martinez, with Ruben Amorim's back three now a thing of the past. But with Martinez absent due to injury against Everton on Monday, he proved similarly influential next to Leny Yoro, using his experience to guide the young defender and reaching double figures for clearances.\n\nImage: Harry Maguire has the best duel success rate in the Premier League since January 17\n\nThe quality of Maguire's defensive work has been apparent across the last six Premier League games. Having won 36 of his 44 duels in that period, he has the highest success rate of any player.\n\nHis future at Manchester United is uncertain, with his contract due to expire in the summer. A place in England's World Cup is no guarantee either given he has not yet had a call-up from Thomas Tuchel. Clearly, though, he has a lot left to offer.\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nPlayer Radar: Who else to keep an eye on\n\nAlex Iwobi and Emile Smith Rowe celebrated their former club Arsenal's North London derby win over Spurs in a video published on social media after helping Fulham beat Sunderland. Next up? Spurs at home, and a chance to inflict more pain on Igor Tudor's side.\n\nOn Friday Night Football, Wolves host Aston Villa live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 7.30pm, kick-off 8pm.\n\nLeeds against Man City is the Saturday Night Football, live on Sky Sports Premier League and Main Event from 5pm, kick-off 5.30pm\n\nWatch Brighton vs Nottingham Forest, Fulham vs Spurs and Man Utd vs Crystal Palace from 1pm across Sky Sports on Sunday, kicking off at 2pm, before Arsenal vs Chelsea at 4.30pm.\n\nThe last column proved a timely one as it outlined the need for Arsenal to unlock Eberechi Eze's full potential before he went and delivered his two-goal performance against Spurs."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says his task at Tottenham is the biggest rescue-job of his career.\n\nThe Spurs head coach arrived in the Premier League with a reputation for instant-impact turnarounds at previous clubs he's managed, having helped Juventus and Lazio secure European football and Udinese avoid relegation.\n\nHowever, following the 4-1 thrashing at home to Arsenal last weekend in his first game in charge, which ramped up the relegation pressure on Spurs, Tudor admitted the scale of his challenge now is the greatest of his career.\n\nSpurs are just four points above the relegation zone and haven't won a league game in 2026.\n\n\"If I recognised the difficulties there are, probably yes [it is the biggest],\" he said in his press conference ahead of Sunday's trip to Fulham, which is live on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's an even bigger motivation that we do it,\" he added.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Highlights from the Premier League clash between Tottenham and Arsenal.\n\nTudor also said it is now all about results for Tottenham, regardless of style of play ,such is the severity of their situation.\n\n\"There's not too much time to think about performance or style,\" he said.\n\n\"Every game needs to be prepared in that way: How are we going to take the points? One way or the other way.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it's for me very clear. I'm not that kind of coach who doesn't want to cure style, how we perform - but in this moment it's not possible to think about those kind of things.\"\n\nHe later said: \"The style is second because it's a question of life and death, if I can say that sportingly.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player On The Premier League Show, we assess whether Tottenham Hotspur are too good to be relegated this season.\n\nAnd on the mentality required, he suggested Spurs should see themselves like an underdog.\n\n\"In Italy they use the term, 'have the mentality of a small team',\" he explained.\n\n\"That's the key always, to have the willingness and motivation like you play against bigger teams.\"\n\nChampions League 'not ideal' with 'hard work' key\n\nTudor was keen not to dwell on the defeat to Arsenal - \"The less we speak the better it is\" - and admitted Spurs' Champions League involvement is \"not an ideal situation\" given their relegation battle in the Premier League.\n\n\"It's a beautiful competition to play, everyone wants to play. The problem is the lack of numbers we have in the team. There's the problem. If you need to play every three days with 10,12, 13... Also it's not only about spending physical energy but also mental energy when every game for us in the league is a final.\"\n\nBut he insisted his players were in no doubt about the situation they are in - and how they will have to fight their way out of it.\n\nFulham\n\nTottenham Hotspur Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\n\"The mentality changes by training. Doing the right things there and to have enough training sessions that you can transmit these things to the team so that on Sunday this can be seen from the fans in the stadium.\n\n\"Hard work. There is no other possibility.\"\n\nTudor confirmed Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso will be in contention to play at Fulham on Sunday after returning to training from injury and that Micky van de Ven should also be fine to feature, despite an issue with one of his little toes.\n\nHe also said he remains hopeful Dejan Kulusevski can return to the field before the end of the season.\n\nTudor dismisses suggestion Van de Ven ignored him during derby\n\nImage: Igor Tudor issues instructions to Micky van de Ven and Djed Spence\n\nFollowing Spurs' defeat to Arsenal, fan footage emerged appearing to show centre-back Micky van de Ven ignoring Tudor's encouragement to push up and then the head coach becoming frustrated.\n\nHowever, Tudor insisted that was not the case.\n\n\"It was not an instruction to Micky, it was an instruction to the team to go up,\" he explained. \"It was not about Micky. It was about the team coming up. We want to go up because we want to have this style that we press high but maybe in this moment it's too much for them. That's why there is a little frustration of that. Nothing special happened.\"\n\nPressed on whether Van de Ven had disrespected him, Tudor said: \"If you watch carefully. You see I don't speak with him. After, I say to him come closer and he comes closer. At that moment I say this, it was for all the defence to go up.\n\n\"We didn't even speak about this because there's nothing to speak about. He's a fantastic guy, very good professional. He'd never do [those] things.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Speaking on Sky Sports FC, Jamie O'Hara breaks down where Spurs went wrong in the North London Derby and why he fears for his former side's chances in the race for Premier League survival.\n\nEx-Tottenham midfielder Jamie O'Hara has slammed the attitude and mentality of the Spurs squad and believes they \"haven't got the stomach for a relegation fight\".\n\nHe told Sky Sports News' Fan Club: \"I was expecting a bit of a manager bounce. Arsenal had a couple of sticky performances against Wolves and Brentford, so I was expecting the team to go into this game with a high attitude, a bit of passion, fight, relentless pressing, and not letting easy crosses in the box.\n\n\"[It was the] complete opposite. It was miles away from where I thought it was. I know there's injuries, but the attitude of the players is my biggest concern. The attitude to defend, to run, to compete, to not concede goals. That for me is basic 101, and then you can talk about creativity, whether we're good enough, whether we've got the players, the formation, but the basic defending, basic mentality of a football club.\""

            "content": "Conor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on the undercard of Tyson Fury's April 11 bout with Arslanbek Makhmudov at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nThe announcement follows Benn's industry-shaking decision to sever ties with Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing and join Zuffa, the new promotion run by UFC boss Dana White.\n\nBenn's first fight under the new arrangement will see him return to the scene of his victory over Chris Eubank Jr to take on two-time super-lightweight world champion Prograis, 30-3 (24).\n\nBenn said: \"April 11 can't come soon enough, returning to Tottenham Hotspur Stadium again, where I made history against Eubank Jr means everything to me.\n\n\"My last fight there showed the world exactly who I am and what I'm about. Fighting on the biggest stages, in the biggest shows, I fear no one! I'm fully locked in and ready to deliver another statement performance.\"\n\nTwo of Prograis' three losses as a professional have come on English soil in world title fights against Josh Taylor in 2019 and Jack Catterall in 2024.\n\nPrograis added: \"Last time I fought in London, Conor Benn was on my undercard, so this is a full-circle moment for me.\n\n\"But this circle will close with me teaching him a lesson on April 11. He's not fighting some weight-drained super-middleweight. I am in shape and will bring home this victory.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Conor Benn says signing a promotional deal with Zuffa will unlock his American dreams and he plans to face Ryan Garcia next and take his world title.\n\nAnother surprise?\n\nSky Sports boxing journalist John Dennen says...\n\nIt's been a busy news week for Conor Benn, and it's still only Thursday. It was a shock to the industry when he made a promotional switch from Matchroom Boxing to new American entity Zuffa.\n\nIt's also a surprise to see him boxing on an undercard. With Tyson Fury vs Aslanbek Makhmudov the main event on April 11, Benn will be providing the chief support at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.\n\nIt's a familiar setting for Benn, in his last two fights he headlined at that stadium against Chris Eubank Jr. But playing a supporting role on the bill will be a step down for him.\n\nNot necessarily a 'tune up' bout as such - Prograis has a track record of real success - but it will be viewed as a contest to prepare him for a bigger fight later in the year, with Ryan Garcia a particular target for the Ilford fighter.\n\nBenn is working his way back down to welter after two consecutive fights at middleweight and he will be the favourite against Prograis.\n\nThe American was in a sensational fight with Josh Taylor when he lost their super-lightweight world title unification at the O2 Arena. He's only lost to top class opposition, Devin Haney and Jack Catterall as well as Taylor.\n\nBut Prograis is a former two-time world champion and if he's sharp, he will be dangerous. At 37 though the question is whether he will be.\n\nThis fight will give us more insights about Benn. Can he make it back to welterweight in good shape, and just how solid a contender will he be there? Benn will start answering those questions against Prograis."

            "content": "The big winners\n\nBodø/Glimt’s 2-1 defeat of Inter at San Siro continued this season’s miracle. The post-match discussion between Inter coach Cristian Chivu and his opposite number, Kjetil Knutsen, was one of admiration, an acknowledgment the Norwegian team had been too good for the runaway Serie A leaders. Even though Inter were without Lautaro Martínez, their standard bearer, a comeback seemed likely as they dominated the early stages. But they found no way through, eventually falling victim to the high-quality, high-speed attacking that had left them with a 3-1 deficit to overcome from the first leg.\n\n“The hardest thing was to create an opening,” lamented Inter’s Nicolò Barella of the long spell of toil that preceded Jens Petter Hauge stabbing in his sixth goal in this season’s competition before Håkon Evjen completed a counter and sealed progress with a brilliant strike.\n\n“We tried everything we could,” Chivu said. Like Manchester City and Atlético Madrid before them, Inter were dumbfounded by the team laying claim to be Scandinavia’s best since IFK Gothenburg picked up two Uefa Cups in the 1980s and reached the European Cup semi-final in 1986.\n\nGalatasaray are into the last 16 after goals by Victor Osimhen and Barış Alper Yilmaz in extra time at Juventus. That tells nothing of the full story of a classic tie, which almost became a classic comeback. Probably the main reason Juve did not fully overturn their 5-2 first-leg deficit was the dismissal of Lloyd Kelly, a red card awarded by video assistant when the on-field official had already awarded a second yellow. How video officials reached that decision was mysterious, controversial; Kelly looked to have accidentally landed on Yilmaz. The Englishman initially believed VAR would come to his rescue but stormed down the tunnel. He missed out on the ecstatic scenes that followed Weston McKennie levelling the tie at 5-5. In injury time, though, Juve ran out of legs, counting the cost of a third red card in four matches.\n\nIn Wednesday’s earlier game, Atalanta had already preserved the dignity of Serie A with a 4-1 defeat of Borussia Dortmund. Atalanta trailed 2-0 from the first leg but perhaps we should have paid attention to a telling stat before kick-off: there has been an Italian team in the last 16 of the competition every season since 1987-88. In Bergamo, Mario Pašalić’s header put Atalanta 3-2 up on aggregate, only for Karim Adeyemi’s lovely goal to push the tie towards extra time. The denouement was bizarre: Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini was sent off after his studs caught the head of Atalanta’s Nikola Krstović in the penalty area as he attempted a backheel flick. Lazar Samardžić stepped up in the ninth minute of added time, with all Atalanta’s usual penalty takers subbed off, to score the spot-kick. He lashed it home to maintain the honour of Italian calcio.\n\nJosé Mourinho has now lost his last 10 Champions League knockout ties. At Real Madrid, parking the Benfica bus did not prove a successful strategy. Although this time it was a literal bus: Mourinho, banned after his red card in the first leg, watched the second leg sat in the team coach. Benfica scored first at the Santiago Bernabéu against a rather languid Madrid through Rafa Silva, only to leave space for Aurélien Tchouaméni to score from distance. In the 80th minute, Vinícius Júnior scored the decider of an edgy match, issuing the final word on a tie that concluded with relative calm. The fallout from last week’s first leg, in which Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni was accused of racially abusing Vinícius, may continue for some time. “Mourinho and I were in contact and share the same feeling: frustration and pride,” said Benfica’s assistant coach, João ­Tralhão. Mourinho’s thoughts remain private. For now, at least.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nIt all came up Norway, as Alexander Sørloth, the one-time Bodø/Glimt loanee, scored the treble for Atlético Madrid that ended Club Brugge’s participation. Sørloth will probably partner Erling Haaland at the summer’s World Cup. The 30-year-old has a harsh journeyman reputation but his skillset has found its home within a Diego Simeone team undergoing a reboot. The hat-trick was Sørloth’s fifth goal in two matches, after a weekend double against Espanyol. They said it\n\n“There are moments when you lose precision and it’s difficult to recover the level.” Luis Enrique breathed a sigh of relief after Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-2 draw with Monaco, who had Mamadou Coulibaly harshly sent off and missed a golden chance to level the tie when Wout Faes headed wide. As it was, the holders squeezed through 5-4 on aggregate. They remain unconvincing, and are yet to find the stride of last season.\n\nThe pundit’s chair\n\n“Italian teams play at a slow pace. When they find teams that play press and run, they don’t have the quality, aren’t accustomed to playing at a high pace, and make mistakes … As soon as they increase the pace in Serie A, they are stopped because a challenge is too hard, a player’s ear is touched, and they go down. These are the results. We play at a slow pace, unfortunately, and when it happens, it’s hard to be dangerous.” Champions League-winning coach Fabio Capello, speaking after Inter’s exit on Sky Italia, diagnoses the Serie A malaise.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFriday’s last 16 draw takes place in Nyon, Switzerland, and the playoffs, or “punishment round” as some insiders term it, have opened up some potentially huge ties. Paris Saint-Germain face either Barcelona or Chelsea. Galatasaray’s reward is one of Liverpool or Tottenham, whose interim coach Igor Tudor had a stint with the Turkish club.\n\nManchester City could face familiar foes: Real Madrid, with whom they have clashed plenty of times before in recent years, or Bodø/Glimt, who shocked them in January. There’s also the potential of an all-English tie in Newcastle v Chelsea, and an all-German one in Bayer Leverkusen v Bayern Munich."

            "content": "When the whistle blows to start USA v Argentina on Sunday in Nashville, a new period of the Emma Hayes era will begin in earnest. The team preparing to play La Albiceleste in Tennessee for the 11th SheBelieves Cup, followed by Canada and Colombia, is the first in more than a year to feature no uncapped players.\n\nFor a head coach who spent 2025 setting, challenging or matching all-time USWNT records for capping players, that is a notable shift and it marks the next phase of the team’s World Cup preparation.\n\nThe first two chapters: Nearly two years ago, Hayes took hold of the humbled giants two months before the Paris Olympics. While noting she felt like a “heart surgeon in the middle of emergency surgery”, the first phase was a whirlwind redemption run that culminated in the USWNT’s fifth gold medal.\n\nIt was slow after the tournament, but last year Hayes worked methodically with her team to develop talent, test a broader pool, foster competition and fold new players into the environment. While securing a record of 12 wins and three defeats, Hayes capped 44 players in the calendar year, the most in the team’s history. She gave debuts to 16 players, the most since 1985, with 38 in all getting starts, the second-most in history and the most since 2001. Since taking over, Hayes has doled out 32 debuts and starts to 55 players.\n\n“You got to create competition,” Hayes said last week. “But to create competition, you got to give people experiences.” Indicating that no one, including those previously in starting spots, was 100% safe in their role, Hayes said: “I expect more competition as a result of the decisions we took last year. But you’ve got to perform. That’s the bottom line.”\n\nThe next step: The absence of uncapped players signifies a shift. Rather than trialling and testing an enormous pool, the four-time Women’s World Cup winners are moving toward refining the group Hayes has built as they prepare for the qualifying tournament in November. “I do think there is clarity, a lot more clarity in terms of the squad of players we are building around for the upcoming year,” said Hayes.\n\nFans can expect a few key themes from this period. For one, as Hayes works towards the Concacaf W Championship (which serves as World Cup qualification), observers can expect healthy experimentation and rotation in the starting XI.\n\nView image in fullscreen Chelsea’s Naomi Girma (left) is part of an established USWNT central defensive pairing. Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA\n\nInjuries, as ever, are one cause for this. Catarina Macario, Kate Wiesner, Tierna Davidson, Croix Bethune, Michelle Cooper, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Wilson are absent due to injuries and other fitness precautions, though Hayes indicated they would all compete for roles when fit. As they re-emerge, and club form fluctuates, some in the camp may move to continue their growth with the under-23s or other youth teams.\n\nAnother cause for rotation and fluctuation is the necessary balance between perfecting the team’s core while encouraging competition and building experience in the main pool. Hayes illustrated this point while discussing her first-choice center-backs, Emily Sonnett and Naomi Girma, and the cadre of less experienced options around them: “When you’ve got such experience like Girma and Sonnett and then a big gap below, it’s always a balance between developing them and developing the players who are my starting center-back pair.”\n\nThere are no uncapped players in camp. But outside five players, no one has more than 42; Riley Jackson has one and 12 players have 10 or fewer. Complemented by a spine of veterans, it is still a notably young squad. Hayes will emphasize gaining experience for all of them before the World Cup: “My job as a coach is to recognize I have to get a group of players ready. And if I just selected 14 players all of the time I genuinely think I’d be failing in this job.”\n\nAnother riveting theme this year is the assured competition for starting roles come next summer. Despite the experience gap Hayes illustrated at center-back, numerous players staked their claim last year for roles held firmly by others two years ago. The goalkeeper position feels open. “Triple Espresso” – Wilson, Swanson and Trinity Rodman – stunned for a summer, but the trio have not figured together since. A squad always dense with attacking talent offered other options in the interim. And with Sam Coffey, Lily Yohannes, Claire Hutton, Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle, Olivia Moultrie, Lindsey Heaps and, when fit, Bethune, all jockeying for lead roles in the midfield, that could quickly become the most interesting part of the pitch to watch.\n\nThey will face interesting competition with varied styles in the SheBelieves Cup. Colombia, ranked 20th in the world, are making their second appearance, and have provided the USWNT entertaining, at times technically masterful and often physically challenging tests in recent meetings. Argentina, ranked 30th, are also making their second appearance and will hope to improve on their last-place finish in 2021. Canada, longtime rivals to the US, enter the fray without a number of marquee names (Olivia Smith is a doubt after an injury in the FA Cup, while Adriana Leon and Ashley Lawrence were omitted to give others a chance) after some disappointing results in 2025, including a 3-0 loss to the USWNT.\n\nThe US, who finished second behind Japan in last year’s edition, will compete to claim their eighth title on 7 March.\n\nGet in touch\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email moving.goalposts@theguardian.com."

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win over Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first-choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set-pieces and cornersas players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says, “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can’t get too much sometimes, but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says Senne Lammens Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan, because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has his strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play, but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic Andre Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world, but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m (£1.1m) in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 (£627) per delegation member has been reduced to $600 (£442). One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 (£369,000) less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves financially advantaged unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s issues is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market.\n\nFifa was contacted for comment."

            "content": "Where will you be when Bodø/Glimt win the Champions League? OK, they won’t win the Champions League, but they could win the Champions League. Could they? Four wins in a row. Manchester City, Atlético Madrid away, Inter comprehensively twice. It’s an astonishing run.\n\nI am generally cynical about anything foisted upon us by the game’s overlords, but after a brilliant couple of nights of football Uefa must be delighted with the drama and excitement these playoffs produced.\n\nParis Saint-Germain a Wout Faes glancing header away from being taken to extra time. Juventus thrillingly close to a 10-man comeback against Galatasaray. Atalanta keeping Serie A alive with that injury-time penalty. OK, less jeopardy with Qarabag, but you can’t have everything.\n\nIt is Bodø/Glimt who are the dream. They were of course helped by Manuel Akanji, who picked the wrong time to start buffering, giving the ball away and then going peak complain at anyone and everyone for a mistake that was at the very least 100% his fault.\n\nThere’s never a good time to do that, but especially when you’ve gone full Terry Butcher: Mr Bump-style bandage wrapped around your head. Butcher would’ve row-zedded that before any thoughts of playing out came into his head. Actually Mr Bump might have at least knocked it down the channels.\n\nBut Bodø/Glimt’s second goal was a thing of beauty. A glorious pass from Jens Petter Hauge and the touch and finish from Håkon Evjen was perfect. They are a good team, with good players – and this is them in pre-season.\n\nWhat struck me most was how the players and staff reacted at full-time. It is slightly different when you know you are through, when one goal isn’t going to change the game. But this wasn’t delirium at the end. It didn’t feel like Macclesfield knocking out Crystal Palace in the FA Cup: everyone running in different directions, not knowing how to act or who to hug (and to be clear, Macclesfield absolutely should have celebrated like that).\n\nThis was quite measured. You got a real sense that Glimt, if they did not expect it, knew it was achievable. And OK, Serie A isn’t the Serie A people of a certain vintage instantly conjure in their minds: Van Basten, Gullit, James Richardson reading the papers. Sadly the 90s were ages ago. But, still, Inter are 10 points clear at the top. They have been in two of the past three Champions League finals.\n\nTransfermarkt figures put the difference in squad value at about €610m (£532m). Bodø/Glimt’s weekly wage bill (FOR THE WHOLE SQUAD) is just over £150,000. Thanks to Jack Kenmare on Sportbible for listing some Premier League players who earn that on their own: Mateo Kovacic, Noni Madueke, Federico Chiesa, Joelinton, Sandro Tonali, Anthony Gordon and Mason Mount.\n\nView image in fullscreen Bodø/Glimt were 2-1 winners in Milan, sealing a comfortable aggregate victory. Photograph: Claudia Greco/Reuters\n\nAnd to paraphrase the Norwegian football expert and Football Weekly galáctico Lars Sivertsen – for whom this run is almost as profitable as Ole Gunnar Solskjær taking over Manchester United – Glimt’s win is good for football. It is good for anyone who loves the game, and especially anyone who supports a team who don’t win anything – which is pretty much all of us.\n\nFootball is about hope. It is about dreaming that one day your team may be the best, or at least beat the best. Reality suggests this is very unlikely. But Glimt were in the second division of Norwegian football a few years ago. And on Tuesday night they comfortably beat Inter.\n\nPerhaps even more importantly, they are the good guys. So often you think you’ve found a charming underdog story, only to discover the owner sells AK47s to children or makes videos of kittens vaping. There’s always something. A nation state, some collection of words – hedge bond tax scheme – that is in some way nefarious. But here it’s a tiny town near Father Christmas with a team who are just brilliantly run and well coached. It is all just, well, nice.\n\nAnd although we like to think the European Super League idea is dead, there are still big clubs who don’t think they should have to sully themselves with random sides from just north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nWill other teams, to quote Conor Coady, be rubbing their lips to get Glimt in the latter stages of this competition? Probably not, but it is human nature to underestimate an opposition like that. And even if they do get knocked out by Sporting or Manchester City in the next round, they have still given us the chance to ask: if they can do it, why can’t we?\n\nCambridge United are second in League Two. One defeat in their past 19 matches. Any lower-league fan will understand – it is an odd feeling to start to expect to win. You feel like you’re cheating. You don’t want to jinx it. I don’t even want to write this down. Please don’t be my fault.\n\nBut carry this on, and it’s League One. Lincoln are proving that it’s possible you don’t have to be one of the mega rich to compete in the third tier. And OK, a movie star or a rapper or a quarterback may have to give us a few quid to get into the Championship and beyond, but it is possible.\n\nCould Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu be the first footballer to play in all four divisions for two teams? Will Louis Appéré be running the channels at the Etihad in 2028-29? Fortunately I’ve never written a column wondering who Louis Appéré is, nor a column questioning the loyalty of Neil Harris.\n\nIn the early 90s we went up the divisions to the top of the second tier in consecutive years. It’s different now, but Glimt show good things are possible. And yes, they won’t win the Champions League, and we’ll get gubbed by MK Dons on Saturday. But you never know – and that tiny bit of hope is everything."

The club are owned by Saudi group SMC.\n\nAlmería’s president, Mohamed al-Khereiji, suggested the player would be particularly involved in the club’s youth programme. “He is considered the best on the pitch,” Khereiji said. “He knows the Spanish leagues very well and understands the potential of what we are building.”\n\nRonaldo, who has played in the Saudi Pro League for Al-Nassr since 2023 and who also owns a stake in the club, became the first footballer included in Bloomberg’s “Billionaire Index” last October. He recently returned to the Al-Nassr first team after a spat over the way the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the national sovereign wealth fund which controls four clubs in the league, handled the winter transfer window. He has scored four times in the last three games.\n\nRonaldo is set to take part in his sixth World Cup next summer although he has suggested that, aged 41, it could be his last."

            "content": "Dean Henderson became a cult hero in south London after saving a penalty in Crystal Palace’s victory against Manchester City in last season’s FA Cup final. The England goalkeeper then boosted his popularity when he dropped into a local pub as supporters celebrated August’s penalty shootout victory over Liverpool in the Community Shield and put £1,000 behind the bar.\n\nHenderson, made captain when Marc Guéhi was sold to Manchester City in January after Palace were humbled in the Cup by non-league Macclesfield, must be wondering how things have turned sour at Selhurst Park so quickly. Supporters turned on the manager, Oliver Glasner, during the first leg of the Conference League playoff against Zrinjski Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina last week and demanded his sacking after another unconvincing performance in the 1-1 draw.\n\nA banner unveiled in the Holmesdale End at the start of Sunday’s 1-0 win against Wolves – only Palace’s second victory in 16 games – took aim at the board and lamented “missed opportunities” since a first major trophy was secured at Wembley last May. It also described Glasner as “finished” after he had told fans to “stay humble”.\n\nGlasner was on his best behaviour as he looked ahead to Thursday’s second leg against Zrinjski, having struck another uneasy truce with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, to see out his contract until the end of the season, meaning it was left to Henderson to issue the rallying call.\n\n“Unity: I think it’s important that we have that,” Henderson said. “It’s been a difficult period and I think the players have to take a lot of responsibility, because we’ve got to do better, first and foremost. For whatever reason it was, we had too many injuries and we just couldn’t cope with the amount of games and the quality we were up against in the Premier League over the last couple of months.\n\n“Now we’ve got everyone back and we’ve got a squad, we’ve been picking up some good results, so hopefully that can give the club a boost. We’re playing European football … and it should be a time for everyone to come together and enjoy that.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans unveil a banner critical of the board and Oliver Glasner before the win against Wolves on Sunday. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/Reuters\n\nHenderson added: “It’s time to shift the narrative and really smile and enjoy these moments because they don’t come round often, instead of putting all the negative spin on everything.”\n\nOne of Glasner’s gripes after the first leg was that some of his players have had their eyes on their next move – an accusation many Palace fans will feel applies to him too. Jean-Philippe Mateta, who Glasner expects back soon from the knee injury that scuppered his January move to Milan, Adam Wharton, Daniel Muñoz and the out-of-contract Daichi Kamada are among those linked with summer moves. Henderson, who is expected to be Jordan Pickford’s backup at the World Cup, warned anyone not committed to the cause they were in for a rude awakening.\n\n“If you don’t put the performances in order, you don’t get the move you want, so they need to be very careful,” he said. “I’m not aware of any of that, but I would suggest they have to be careful if they were thinking like that.”\n\nWharton’s form in particular has dipped in recent weeks but Glasner pointed out that the England midfielder had already played more than 1,000 minutes more than he had last season, owing to Palace’s involvement in the Conference League.\n\n“Players have to cope with a completely new situation in their career,” he said. “I remember I spoke to Eddie Howe at Newcastle when they played the first time in the Champions League. They were massively struggling and I spoke about his experience. But we are still the second-best amount of points ever [at this stage for Palace].\n\n“We have the European competitions and we have had some big injury problems at the end of last year. We had the Afcon [Africa Cup of Nations], we had some big noise in any single transfer window, and when I see the big picture, everything that happened for me, it’s just incredible where we are right now.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Oliver Glasner speaks to the press alongside Henderson before the Conference League playoff second leg against Zrinjski Mostar. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\nPalace are three points behind eighth-placed Bournemouth in the Premier League and Glasner insists whoever replaces him could be competing in Europe again next season. He won the Europa League in 2022 with Eintracht Frankfurt before falling out with the hierarchy the following season despite reaching the German Cup final and is aiming to reach a fourth final in five seasons. But, perhaps wisely given Palace’s difficulty in breaking down low blocks, he was wary of making the bold prediction that Palace can go all the way before Zrinjski’s visit.\n\n“I think for 120 years Crystal Palace entered every cup competition to win it,” he said. “This group of players has done it once last year. Every team will enter the competition, but just one can leave with the trophy at the end, and it just makes no sense to talk now about it.”"

            "content": "The shipment of Eric Ramsay’s possessions must have hardly made it to the West Midlands in time. After leaving Minnesota United this MLS offseason, his era in charge of West Bromwich Albion lasted just 44 days, during which time the Baggies played nine games, and won none. The club couldn’t afford to be patient; not while perched just one point above the drop zone in the Championship. Ramsay was sacked on Tuesday.\n\nIn one sense, this is business as usual in the English system’s second tier. Ramsay is the 11th coach to be sacked, to resign, or part by mutual consent since the 2025-26 season commenced, and the league’s 12th mid-season change when counting Rob Edwards’ move to Wolves. One level below, League One has seen nine such changes; League Two has undergone seven. As Ramsay himself said a year ago: “getting managers sacked is a bit of a national sport.”\n\nAnd yet, Ramsay’s dismissal restarted a specific discourse, summed up most bluntly on Talksport by Charlie Austin, the veteran striker who spent 18 months with West Brom and now plays for Hungerford Town. Asked why teams are hiring “these MLS American coaches,” Austin quickly retorted: “I think people have watched Ted Lasso and got carried away if I’m honest.\n\n“I don’t get it. For a club like Celtic, what they’ve done with Wilfried Nancy. It’s painful. That appointment that Celtic made could cost them a title up there, and West Brom [hiring Ramsay] could cost them Championship football.”\n\nOf course, neither Nancy nor Ramsay are American. Born in Shrewsbury and raised in Llanfyllin, Wales, Ramsay had no pro playing career of significance, instead coaching in the youth ranks of Swansea City and Chelsea before joining Manchester United in 2021. There, he worked under Ole Gunnar Solskjær, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag. His multi-lingualism is credited for helping Casemiro integrate, with some describing him as a “secret weapon” for the club.\n\nNancy was born in Le Havre and played in France for a decade before moving to Quebec in 2005 and launching his coaching career soon after. He led CF Montréal to its best stretch since Didier Drogba left, then led Columbus to an awe-inspiring MLS Cup win balancing effectiveness with aesthetics. Yet his move to the UK went similarly to Ramsay’s: eight games in charge of Celtic, two wins, and just 33 days in total.\n\nTheir paths to this point were significantly different, but now Nancy and Ramsay are linked in the eyes of many: two MLS managers who couldn’t cut it on their side of the Atlantic.\n\nView image in fullscreen Wilfried Nancy’s reign at Celtic lasted just 33 days – the club’s shortest managerial tenure ever. Photograph: Russell Cheyne/Reuters\n\nWhy did this happen? It may be helpful to start with what each coach was seemingly expected to do: win immediately, or else. This is an obviously ill-fitting task for these specific coaches, coming from the specific league they came from.\n\nNancy and Ramsay succeeded in MLS thanks to some of the league’s most crystalized tactical ideologies. As Thierry Henry – who appointed Nancy to his backroom staff in Montréal and whose departure led to Nancy’s first senior head coaching role – told me in 2024: “Wil is very important because he will live and die by [his philosophy] … At the end of the day, when he finishes a game, it’s very important that he doesn’t talk about the result. He talks about the how.”\n\nRamsay, meanwhile, turned Minnesota United into “the most aggressive set-piece team in the world”. Thanks to injury plagues and international duty, the Loons kept a tight defensive shape and attacked primarily through transition phases and dead-ball scenarios. While he’d openly pined for a chance to have more control over the ball, that philosophy will generally play in a relegation scrap. What West Brom overlooked, seemingly, was Ramsay’s preference to play with a five-man defense, a problem considering their squad’s relative thinness at the back.\n\nAnd then there’s the structural issue. Thanks to MLS’s spring-to-fall calendar, both coaches arrived midway through their new team’s season. “NancyBall” takes time to execute; so too does embracing a bus-parking kayfabe. Yet neither coach had a pre-season to install these ideas, and neither destination was in much of a position to be patient at the time of their arrival. Should we blame the managers for saying yes to an advancement opportunity, or the club hierarchies for offering it to them regardless of their chances of success?\n\nIn stark contrast to the Scottish or English league systems, MLS’s lack of relegation and relative parity among teams permits plenty of runway for managers who want to establish their ideologies. In time, sometimes, those ideas work.\n\n“You get an element of patience,” Ramsay told the Guardian last January. “If you look at it, the lifespan of a manager in MLS versus the Championship is significantly longer. I’m sort of out of the spotlight that young British coaches would be in at any level if they took a job [in English football]. You get to develop some of the things that are really important in a coach’s trajectory. You’re doing it with a sense of stability.”\n\nIt’s a refrain we’re hearing more stateside, most recently after the Colorado Rapids hired Matt Wells. The 37-year-old Englishman joined in December, having been on Tottenham’s first team coaching staff under Ange Postecoglou and Thomas Frank.\n\n“I’m a bold person, and I also look at other people – obviously Eric [Ramsay], but there’s other coaches that are coaching in different leagues across the world, the likes of Robbie Keane and Liam Rosenior, coaches I really, really respect,” Wells told the MLS website, just before Rosenior’s move from Strasbourg to Chelsea. “I actually love the fact that they take a different pathway. They don’t take the easy option just to go to the Championship. I think the rate of development I’m going to get by moving here is going to be far accelerated.”\n\nPerhaps someday, Wells will be the next coach bandied about for a job in England or elsewhere in Europe. Whenever that day comes, for him or another MLS peer, Nancy and Ramsay will be cited as cause for concern, just as Bob Bradley and Jesse Marsch were before them.\n\nOr maybe not. The context will radically alter next summer, when MLS flips its calendar to play its seasons from late summer to spring – the same as Europe and much of the world. A coach wanting to finish the ongoing season with his MLS side can do so and swiftly relocate with the promise of a full pre-season ahead. Time will tell whether that prospective employer will be able to drown out the anti-MLS groans bound to accompany their rumors.\n\nBut in the event of such an appointment, they’ll hope to enter a sporting structure with a clearer vision and more capacity for patience than Nancy or Ramsay enjoyed."

I think the issue is about a whole raft of other things.\n\n\"But the bottom line is they had the means, they proved the funding, they proved the principle of the cash, they've gone to the highest bidder, they put £4million which is now gone, they've kissed goodbye to £4million.\n\n\"And the administrator has other bids in town, and people are going to have to get a bit more realistic about this.\n\n\"It's all well and good suggesting that you want to buy something, that's why I wouldn't get in with my guy into a bidding war.\n\n\n\n4 Wednesday are 'six years of hard work' away from being back to where they should be, says Jordan Credit: Getty\n\n\"Do you want this? Go bid for yourselves, go pull your own arm off at the shoulder, you're not going to me in an auction to pay twice what the price of this business should be bought for.\n\n\"Great football club, great potential, it's going to take a hell of a lot of work, going to get relegated, might even take a 15-point sanction next year if people are sensible and don't want to pay Chansiri 25p in the pound.\n\n\"Then you've got six years (of) hard work and hundreds of millions of quid to get it back to where you might want to get it back to, because anyone buying a football club that isn't a Sheffield Wednesday fan, is buying it as an investment.\"\n\nJordan admitted in November that he believed Wednesday were worth just £30million in their current state.\n\n\n\nHe added that this would also include the purchase of the club's stadium, Hillsborough, as well as giving Chansiri 'as little as possible'.\n\nWith relegation from the Championship already confirmed, the Owls host Southampton on Saturday.\n\nWhat is the '25p in the pound' rule? Under EFL rules (specifically the Insolvency Policy), the person or group buying the club is given a choice regarding how they pay back the 'unsecured' (non-football) creditors: The 25p Rule: Pay the creditors at least 25p for every £1 owed as an immediate, lump-sum payment upon the transfer of the club's 'Golden Share' (the right to play in the league). The 35p Alternative: If they can't pay it all at once, they must pay at least 35p in the pound spread over a maximum of three years. If a new owner fails to meet these minimum repayment thresholds, the EFL triggers a sporting penalty. If they don't meet the 25p/35p rule, they are hit with a further 15-point deduction at the start of the next season.\n\nIt follows a midweek defeat at Norwich City in their first outfit since a return to League One was sealed.\n\nHenrik Pedersen's side sit bottom of the table on -7 points after winning just one of their 34 matches so far this season."

We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room.\n\n\"There was another small room and I said, 'This is enough, because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any.' It might sound arrogant, but I know I can coach a football team. But I don't need to do it until my last day.\"\n\nRed Bull gives you wings?\n\nHowever, according to Salzburger Nachrichten, the Salzburg-based publication that first reported of a potential link-up between manager and group, neither Klopp nor Red Bull are happy with the current development.\n\nRed Bull clubs RB Leipzig, Leeds United and Paris FC are all struggling in their respective leagues this season.\n\nShould Klopp and Red Bull part ways, then Crystal Palace head coach Oliver Glasner, who will leave Selhurst Park this summer, has been linked with succeeding Klopp.\n\nGlas all over?\n\nGlasner has previous links with the Red Bull Group having worked as a sporting coordinator and assistant coach at Red Bull Salzburg.\n\n3 Red Bull clubs are struggling this season with Klopp in his role Credit: Getty\n\nMintzlaff, though, has hit back at rumours that Klopp is set to depart the Red Bull Group, stating: \"That is complete nonsense and entirely made up.\n\n\"On the contrary: we are extremely satisfied with Jürgen Klopp’s work. He invests a great deal, is in constant communication with our coaches and sporting directors, and is continuing to sustainably develop our Red Bull football philosophy.\n\n\"We are convinced that he is the right man for this job. That is where we are placing all of our focus and energy.\"\n\nA Klopp out\n\nSome reports suggest that Klopp is being eyed as a long-term replacement for Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid.\n\nLos Blancos relieved Alonso of his duties at the Bernabeu last month, with Alvaro Arbeloa handed the capital club reins until the end of the season.\n\nGermany, meanwhile, may turn to Klopp as a potential successor to Julian Nagelsmann.\n\n3 Nagelsmann will lead Germany at the 2026 World Cup Credit: Getty\n\nThe former Bayern boss will lead Die Mannschaft at the 2026 World Cup in North America this summer and recently penned a new contract with the Germany national team through to Euro 2028.\n\nLast week, Angelina Kelly felt that Klopp 'should want' the Manchester United job as she discussed the German manager with Alex Crook on Fiery Fridays."

I actually have a picture of that exact corner in my office thanks to this man and the trophy.\n\n\"What an amazing, amazing player, top, top player. More importantly, above all of that, a great man as well and a great person to have around as well.\n\n\"Always what I loved about Juan is in really difficult situations, he’d always see the best in a really tough situation.\n\n\"He always had a really mature head on young shoulders and I think people like him and Cesc Fabregas, they see the game in a completely different way to other people because they’re special, special talents.\n\n\"I think he’s going to be a top manager or a top coach if he goes into that space post-retirement.\n\n4 The Spaniard was left speechless after Terry's touching voicenote to him Credit: talkSPORT\n\n\"Juan, I hope you’re well mate. I love you, I miss you and I hope to see you soon.\"\n\nMata was left speechless as he smiled after hearing the message from the former Chelsea skipper.\n\nThe World Cup winner had only been 23-years-old when he joined the club from Valencia in 2011.\n\nMata on Chelsea exit\n\nAfter just two-and-a-half years, though, Mata was sold to United by Jose Mourinho.\n\nHe has now lifted the lid on why he left the club after enjoying a stellar first two seasons in west London.\n\nMata explained: \"It was in my third season, we had a couple of changes in the club with players and the coach.\n\n4 Mata was sold to United by Mourinho in 2014 after two-and-a-half years at Chelsea Credit: Getty - Contributor\n\n\"It was a fact that I didn’t play as much as I was used to and I was of course not happy with that situation coming from those two seasons.\n\n\"I tried to keep going, I stayed professional, of course respected the players that were playing at the time and it came to a finish because in December I had the opportunity to go to Manchester United.\n\n\"We both, Chelsea and myself, thought that was the best option and also when you have the opportunity to play for a club like United, I think it’s difficult to say no.\"\n\nMourinho succeeded interim boss Rafael Benitez at the start of the 2013/14 campaign.\n\nMata subsequently made just 11 starts in the Premier League during the first half of the season, failing to score and providing just two assists.\n\nHe would go on to win another Europa League and FA Cup with United as well as lifting the League Cup for the Red Devils.\n\nAcross his time in England, Mata made 278 Premier League appearances, scoring 52 goals and adding 56 assists.\n\nHaving left United in 2022, he joined Victory in September following a year with fellow A-League outfit Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\nMelbourne Victory vs Adelaide United on 27 February kicks off at 8:35am in the UK and will be headlined by a special performance by Melbourne-based DJ Orkestrated, who will be performing pre-game and at half-time.\n\nIf you’re in Melbourne, tickets start from $35.

            "content": "AN ELITE US fighter jet pilot has allegedly betrayed his country by training Chinese military pilots to kill fellow Americans.\n\nGerald Brown, 65, is a veteran pilot who commanded sensitive units responsible for the delivery of nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ex-U.S. Air Force officer has been charged with giving and conspiring to provide defense services to Chinese military pilots without authorization, in violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA).\n\nBrown, also known by the call sign “Runner,” is today expected to have his initial appearance before a Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of Indiana.\n\nIt’s alleged that the flying ace began training Chinese military pilots three years ago, 27 years after leaving active service.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Brown used a co-conspirator to negotiate with Stephen Su Bin, according to the Office Public Affairs.\n\nREAD MORE US NEWS GUNNED DOWN Four US speedboat passengers killed by Cuba coastguard as 'guns found on board'\n\n\n\nSu Bin is a Chinese national who in 2016 pled guilty in California to conspiring to hack into the computer networks of major U.S. defense contractors and steal sensitive military and export-controlled data for China.\n\n“Throughout these communications, Brown consistently stated his intent to train [Chinese] military pilots in combat aircraft operations,” the department alleged in its press release.\n\nBrown wrote in his resumé that his “objective” was to work as an “instructor fighter pilot.”\n\n\n\n“A co-conspirator told Brown that he hoped Brown would be assigned to ‘my base, but otherwise you’ll go where is the local equivalent as the [U.S. Air Force] Weapon School,’ the release alleged.\n\n“Later, he stated to a co-conspirator that, upon his arrival in China, ‘Now…. I have the chance to fly and instruct fighter pilots again!'”\n\nBrown traveled to China in December 2023 to start his job, training China’s military pilots.\n\nAfter arriving in the communist regime, he “answered questions for three hours about the U.S. Air Force,” the department alleged.\n\nHe remained in China until he returned to the United States earlier this month – when he was arrested.\n\n\n\nWho is U.S. Air Force officer and pilot Gerald Brown? More on the flying ace's background Gerald Eddie Brown, Jr., also known by the call sign “Runner,” 65, is a U.S. citizen The ex-F-35 Lightning II instructor pilot has decades of experience flying U.S. military aircraft\n\nBrown served for over 24 years in the U.S. Air Force\n\nHe left active duty in 1996 with the rank of Major\n\nBrown commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems\n\nHe also led combat missions\n\nBrown served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft\n\nThese included the F-4 “Phantom II,” F-15 “Eagle,” F-16 “Fighting Falcon,” and the A-10 “Thunderbolt II” (Warthog)\n\nBrown then served as a commercial cargo pilot\n\nMore recently, he was a contract simulator instructor for two different U.S. defense contractors\n\nHe trained U.S. military pilots to fly the A-10 and the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter\n\nHis arrest comes just two months before U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit China, where he is expected to talk about Taiwan, soybeans, and evil Vladimir Putin’s bloodthirsty war in Ukraine.\n\n“The United States Air Force trained Major Brown to be an elite fighter pilot and entrusted him with the defense of our nation,” said assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg.\n\n“He now stands charged with training Chinese military pilots.\n\n“When U.S. persons – whether military or civilian – provide training to a foreign military, that activity is illegal unless they have a license from the State Department.\n\n“The National Security Division will use all tools at its disposal to protect our military advantages and hold to account those who would violate the AECA.”\n\n\n\nBrown “allegedly betrayed his country by training Chinese pilots to fight against those he swore to protect,” said assistant director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.\n\n“The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the U.S. armed forces to modernize China’s military capabilities.”\n\nRozhavsky said that the pilot’s arrest served “as a warning” to others keen to betray the U.S. and the country’s many allies.\n\n“The FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardize our national security,” Rozhavsky vowed.\n\n\n\nU.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro for the District of Columbia accused Brown of allegedly “betraying the country, jeopardizing the safety of our servicemembers and allies.”\n\n“As an Air Force Officer, Brown took an oath to defend our nation against all enemies foreign and domestic – he broke that oath,” Pirro claimed.\n\n“The Department of Justice and my prosecutors are steadfast in our commitment to use every lawful tool available to keep American military expertise where it belongs – here in America,” the attorney added.\n\nThose who leak U.S. military training secrets to adversaries, such as China, “represent a significant threat to national security,” said Lee M. Russ, executive director of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations Office of Special Projects.\n\n\n\nRuss accused Brown of “violating trust and endangering our service members.”\n\nThe complaint alleges that, since at least in or around August 2023, Brown willfully conspired with foreign nationals and Americans to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force, known as the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).\n\nThe PLA serves the Communist Party of China (CPC), which recently practised a daring decapitation strike drill on Taiwan.\n\n“This training was a defense service under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR),” the Office of Public Affairs’ release added.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Brown, a U.S. person under the ITAR, lacked the required license from the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) to provide that training to foreign persons or foreign military units.”\n\n\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping has set an ambitious goal of shaping the PLA into a “world-class”force by 2049, warned the U.S. Naval Institute last October."

And despite living in New York in the US, one Korean foodie who shares her recipes online decided to give her parents their first taste of a Full English to see what they would think.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe cook, known as 'Crazy Korean Cooking' on Instagram, often sees her videos go viral online, seeing as she boasts 1.2million followers.

She even bizarrely compared it to chocolate.\n\nNext was the back bacon, as her mum simply said, \"well done\" after eating it with chopsticks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHer dad also said that British people \"must eat really well\" after trying the baked beans, while her mum branded the sausage \"delicious\".\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nAfter this, her mum went for a combination of fried bread, egg and bacon, and exclaimed: \"It's bang on!\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe also tried a combination of sausage, bacon and kimchi, while her dad tried a mixture of kimchi, bacon, beans and mushroom.\n\nAfter finishing the meal, her dad described it as \"bussing\" as he then tried a British cup of tea, which he said was \"delicious\".\n\nFollowing up in the caption, the foodie wrote: \"Mum nd dad try full English breakfast for the first time. I made Northern England Bury style black pudding, English back bacon, bangers (sausages), baked beans served with fried eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms and toast.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Overall I was happy about how things turned out. Baked beans got reduced a bit too much while I was cooking other things but I didn’t wanna fix it because all other items was gonna get cold but it tasted good.\"\n\nPeople were loving the post, as it racked up more than 148,000 likes.\n\nOne person exclaimed: \"That fried bread/egg/bean/sausage combo was god tier.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile another added: \"Mum said it’s ’Bang on!’, she's basically one of us in the UK.\"\n\nA third chimed in: \"Let's be real, the UK may suck for many reasons right now, but our breakfast is the best ever. Let me have that.\"\n\nMany people also applauded their slight alternations, such as the addition of kimchi and eating it with chopsticks.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nOne person exclaimed: \"As a British chef, the second they started combining things with kimchi, a lightbulb went off in my head because kimchi and black pudding would be such a perfect combination with the way the flavours balance each other and then your mum tried it and said, 'perfect combo'.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Eating a Full English with chopsticks is an absolute flex.

Experts and human rights groups argue this fuels small boat crossings.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMigration and citizenship minister Mike Tapp told The Mirror that the Government is committed to doing so - but only once illegal migration is under control.

The majority of these were Ukrainians fleeing the war in their homeland.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA further 49,081 grants were issued to people outside the UK - of which 14,868 were on Ukraine schemes. This was a 23% drop on 2024's figure.\n\nImran Hussain, director of external affairs at Refugee Council, said: “If the government wants to provide a genuine alternative to perilous small boat crossings, then it must provide safe and legal routes for refugees.\n\n“But people fleeing war and oppression are being pushed into dangerous journeys because safe routes are being shut down.

Nicole Melillo Shaw, Volvo UK's managing director, confirmed that a \"tiny percentage\" of its EX30 SUVs have ignited worldwide.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSome 40,000 models are being recalled globally. Motorists have been instructed not to charge their batteries above 70 per cent.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast, Ms Melillo Shaw said: \"I completely empathise with anyone who's experienced this. We have a proportion of our EX30 cars that have had risk of catching fire when they've been charged beyond 70%.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"So as a safety brand and safety being our top priority, we have advised customers not to charge beyond 70% until we find a fix.

Additionally, we would advise the following precautions.\n\n\"Do not leave your vehicle unattended while charging within buildings or covered areas.

Sources report that he was attacked with a metal bar in the prison workshop.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs one of the most infamous child killers in the UK, Huntley has been assaulted multiple times by fellow lags over the years, with previous attacks seeing him doused with boiling water and slashed across the neck.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAll the while, the families of Holly and Jessica have been forced to continue on with their lives in the shadow of unimaginable loss. The two girls, both just 10 years old, vanished during a family BBQ in the Cambridgeshire village of Soham on August 4, 2002. They were never seen alive again.\n\nIan Huntley police update as he fights for life after prison attack READ MORE :\n\nView 5 Images Kevin and Nicola Wells nearly reached breaking point in the months after their daughter's death (Image: Press Association)\n\nA widespread search for the best friends ensued, with a photograph of the duo clad in their matching Manchester United shirts burned into the consciousness of concerned parents across the country. Among those assisting with the search was the then 28-year-old Huntley, who'd been working as a caretaker at the girls' school. Huntley, who even spoke with the press during the search, told officers how he'd spoken with the missing children on his doorstep immediately before their disappearance.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOfficers quickly became suspicious of his account, however, and a true picture of what really happened that day soon began to emerge. Tragically, a gamekeeper discovered the burned bodies of Holly and Jessica in an irrigation ditch near an RAF base on August 17, 13 days after the pair walked away from the family gathering together.\n\nIt would later transpire that, after spotting the friends, Huntley enticed them into his home, claiming that his girlfriend, Maxine Carr, a teaching assistant at their school, was inside. He then murdered them and concealed their bodies in the ditch, before unsuccessfully attempting to dispose of their distinctive Manchester United shirts at his workplace. On August 20, Huntley was charged with two counts of murder and, in December 2003, was handed two life sentences, with a minimum term of 40 years behind bars. He won't be eligible for parole until at least 2042.\n\nView 5 Images Sharon and Leslie Chapman have rarely spoken out about Jessica's murder (Image: Press Association)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis partner, Carr, faced charges of aiding and abetting an offender on two counts but was ultimately acquitted. She was, however, sentenced to three-and-a-half years for perverting the course of justice. Upon her release, after serving just half of her sentence, Carr was given a new identity. While Jessica's parents, Sharon and Leslie Chapman, have rarely spoken out about their terrible bereavement, Holly's parents, Kevin and Nicola Wells, have offered some insight into how their lives were changed forever, and how they remained determined to make it \"out the other side\".\n\nIn the early days after losing their daughter, Kevin feared that he and Nicola would become one of many couples who part ways after losing a child. In a 2012 ITV documentary, Soham: A Parents' Tale, aired to mark the ten-year anniversary of the double tragedy, Kevin reflected: “She [Nicola] was lost in a kind of wilderness, whereas I was more hard-line about my emotions. For the first five months after Holly died, we broke down together, but after that, we processed our grief at different speeds. It was one, almost two years before we found each other again, but grief gives you a different sense of the passage of time, and it slipped by unnoticed.”\n\nThe heartbroken father, who penned the 2005 book Goodbye, Dearest Holly, told the Mail on Sunday that he vowed not to become a statistic. “They say 95 per cent of the parents of murdered children split up,\" he said. \"We were determined to be among the five per cent who survive, but for a year, perhaps 18 months, I couldn't reach my wife.\" In the years that followed, the Wells family faced plenty of upheaval and, in 2006, made the difficult decision to move out of their Soham home, finding the memories of Holly too agonising to face.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Killer Ian Huntley has once again been attacked in prison (Image: PA)\n\nMoney was also an issue. Struggling financially after having to sell Kevin's business at a loss, the couple were forced to remortgage their house and accept £6,000 from a charity to cover bills. Thankfully, the family were able to gradually get back on track. After launching his contract cleaning business from scratch in 2005, Kevin was later joined by his son Oliver, who was just 12 years old when his sister disappeared.\n\nRecalling how, for the next two years, he and Oliver “went up ladders and chit-chatted about life until it felt OK again”, Kevin shared: “Getting back to work was not just about money in the bank, it was also about what it represented – an everyday life, a familiar pattern, some kind of control.\" Kevin has since thrown himself into honouring his daughter's memory, and in 2012, he ran the London Marathon in memory of Holly and Jessica, raising almost £8,000 for the Grief Encounter Project, which was there for his family in their hour of need.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKevin, who is a patron of the Grief Encounter Project, completed the 26-mile course in five hours, four minutes and 58 seconds. and shared on his JustGiving website how the charity had been crucial in helping with \"the uninvited grieving process can have on your life and your future\". That same year, the family moved back into their old home in Soham, where it's understood Huntley's name is never uttered.\n\nView 5 Images According to Kevin, he and his family do not 'reflect' on the freedom of Maxine Carr (Image: Press Association)\n\nIn 2015, Kevin shed some light on what life was like in their changed household, telling Good Morning Britain: \"We still think of Holly every day; we have her pictures in and around the house, but it's not a shrine - we don't live in the past.\" When questioned as to what he thought about the release of Carr, Kevin simply replied: \"We don't reflect on it at all. It's been through the court process, and we accept the outcome and focus our attention on other areas.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExplaining how he made it through those devastating early years, Kevin previously revealed: “Murder has the capacity to destroy more lives than the one taken. I recognised that from the start, so I tried to take control, to make plans and to exert positive thought. I clung to my family, my community, my work, sometimes to God and sometimes to a late-night tumbler of whisky. I chose to believe in the future, a future that I could craft from the life we once had. Really, all I wanted was for us to be the ones who'd make it out the other side.”\n\nFor Holly's brother Oliver, growing up without his sister by his side was difficult. In 2012, Oliver, by then a father of two himself, opened up for the first time about his loss, remarking, \"I wish I could see her now, see what she'd have looked like. We do chat about her quite regularly, which I think is a very nice thing. It's strange being three of us, when there used to be a fourth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, mum Nicola felt her daughter's absence in the activities the little girl had once enjoyed. Remembering \"the busyness\" of Holly, she remembered: “The music and dancing and drawing, the reading, the homework, the friends, the Brownies, the Majorettes. I used to grind my teeth at the hours I spent driving her to activities. Now I long to be able to do it.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhile Jessica's parents, Leslie and Sharon, have kept a relatively low profile, they did release a rare statement on the tenth anniversary of their daughter’s death, showing support for police plans to create a national database for sex offenders. They stated: “We hope [the database’s] use will mean other families don’t suffer the same loss and heartbreak as we did.\"\n\nDo you have a story to share? Email me at julia.banim@reachplc.com"

They are typically used by couples unable to get any privacy in their own homes, or those looking for some discreet private time\n\nView Image Love Hotels are prevalent throughout Japan (stock image) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nWhat matters most when you're looking for a hotel? Do you prioritise closeness to bars and restaurants? Perhaps you're after indulgent luxury and pampering? Or is getting value for money your main concern?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOr maybe you're seeking somewhere with a boxing ring and a spacecraft-shaped bed? A Reddit user posted a collection of images from an abandoned 'love hotel' in Japan, showcasing some truly bewildering features.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe pictures show baffling features including a bed shaped like a spacecraft, a Playboy-themed room featuring what looks like a circular, revolving bed, and another containing a merry-go-round, horses included. Additional photographs reveal a Rolls-Royce-styled bed, a room with a miniature boxing ring and ceiling mirrors, and one that looks worryingly like a soft play.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLove Hotels are prevalent across Japan, permitting guests to check in for durations as brief as one hour, reports the Daily Star. They are typically used by couples unable to get any privacy in their own homes, or those looking for some discreet private time, according to Japan Travel.\n\nThe poster wrote: \"An abandoned love hotel! One with a different theme in every room!\n\n\"This hotel closed around the turn of the century. The reasons vary, from fire to the aging population in the region.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It's a discreet hotel, where you could book rooms by the hour or by the night. You could park your car in the one-spot garages, which no one could see.\n\n\"It was quite large, three stories high! The rooms are all different, some crazier than others!\n\n\"We came across an S&M room complete with a horse and whips! But also a spaceship, which actually moved! Or a circus room, complete with a rotating carousel with horses!\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Will you take a chance in the Playboy room? Red or black? A round of madness in the ring? Or would you rather jump around on the bouncy castle? Well, jumping..\n\n\"There was even a luxury Rolls-Royce! And much more!\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Each room was also equipped with a shower and a phone for food and drinks! An unique, but above all, imaginative place! Which room will you choose?\"\n\nAccording to travel website tokyocheapo.com, Love Hotels have existed throughout Japan since the latter part of the 1950s. \"At the time, Japanese homes were usually designed with sleeping areas doubling as living areas during the day and, as a result, not much scope for afternoon delight - and even less so if you had kids or live-in in-laws,\" the site explains.\n\nAlso referred to as 'rabuho', they often feature kitsch, themed accommodation, adorned with vivid colours and furnishings, as reported by Japan Travel. While they carry a reputation as destinations for romantic encounters, they're also used by people who need somewhere for a break, and typically don't require advance reservations.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey're also reasonably priced, with stays generally beginning at approximately 3,000 Yen (£14.20). Though most establishments exclusively accommodate male and female pairs, turning away solo travellers and same-sex partners or imposing additional charges.\n\nReddit users expressed astonishment at the photographs. One commented: \"It must have cost a fortune to set this place up. I'm surprised that they haven't sold off the tailor-made beds. The red velvet one looks lush!\n\n\"I'd love to see this place in real life. I think I'd have looked to see it before it was closed, too. But I've no idea which room I'd choose; those you listed don't grab my attention lol.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "A big weekend of Premier League action awaits and several managers are taking their press conferences today to preview the matches. Stay here with Daily Mail Sport for all the latest...\n\nThis job is harder than I thought, admits Tudor\n\nIgor Tudor fears the size of the task Tottenham is bigger and more challenging than he expected.\n\nTudor is less than a fortnight into his salvage operation, and his only game in charge was the 4-1 defeat at home to Arsenal.\n\n'Probably, yes, I agree with you,' replied the interim boss when asked if the job was tougher than he thought it would be. 'Very tough.'\n\nA run of nine Premier League games without a win has plunged Spurs to within four points of the relegation zone.\n\nArsenal thrashed Tottenham 4-1 in Igor Tudor's first match in charge last Sunday\n\nTudor’s appointment until the end of the season after Thomas Frank’s sacking was based upon his reputation for making an instant impact on ailing teams, including at Juventus and Lazio in Italy, but the 47-year-old Croatian agreed the scale of this task seemed greater because of the implications of relegation for a club of Spurs’ illustrious stature.\n\n'Probably, if I see, if I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes,' he said. “It’s even a bigger challenge, even a bigger motivation to do this and we do it.'\n\nTudor said style of play and entertainment would have to take second place behind the desperate need for points. 'The style needs to be in the second moment, because now it’s a question of life and death,' he said. 'If I can use that term in a sporting way.'\n\nLike Frank, however, he will not be throwing around the word ‘relegation’.\n\n'No, I never used it,' said Tudor. 'Not because it’s too scary, or a \"danger word\", or because we won’t sleep. It’s because we need to refocus on ourselves. The same way I speak with my players. To be focused on ourselves, on the training.\n\n'That’s the only thing we can change so there is nothing to think about. The future, or the points, even. The points come as a consequence of the training and the game. That’s the main and only focus we need to have.'\n\nPedro Porro and Kevin Danso are back in training and available for the trip to Fulham on Sunday, but Spurs are still without eight injured first teamers and Cristian Romero, who will serve the third of his four-match ban at Craven Cottage.\n\nMicky van de Ven has a toe problem that is not expected to rule him out.\n\nTudor also responded to a video clip which has drawn attention online with Spurs fans claiming Van de Ven had been ignoring touchline instruction from the new boss during the Arsenal game.\n\nTudorsuggested Dejan Kulusevski is not far away from a return after a bad knee injury\n\n'It was not an instruction to Micky,' said Tudor. 'It was an instruction to the team to go up. Micky is a fantastic guy, a very good professional, he would never do these things.'\n\nOther injuries, he said, were being monitored on a ‘weekly basis’, including Dejan Kulusevski, who has not played this season and is still on a long road back from a serious knee injury.\n\n'I know him from Juventus,' said Tudor. 'Fantastic player, fantastic guy. Difficult moment. He’s had really big problems, as you know, here. But he’s positive. Also, the doctors are positive. So we’ll see, next week, how it’s going.'\n\nMatt Barlow\n\nOkafor the only absentee as Farke urges his Leeds underdogs to bite back\n\nDaniel Farke says Leeds are ready to thrive on their 'underdog' status against Manchester City at Elland Road on Saturday.\n\nLeeds have lost only two of their last 14 league games in their fight for survival, while City are chasing a fourth straight win to keep the heat on title rivals Arsenal.\n\nFarke said: 'We're looking forward to this game. We're facing the best and most successful side in the UK and world football over the last decade. They've won everything.\n\n'It's a challenge we're looking forward to. It's always great to play at a packed Elland Road. We are of course the underdog, but we've shown several times that we can deliver convincing performances.\n\n'We've worked so hard to be able to play against the top sides so we value being capable of being competitive with the best teams in the world.'\n\nLeeds, for whom Noah Okafor is the only absentee, will take heart from the reverse fixture at the Etihad Stadium in November when they fought back from 2-0 down to level before losing out to Phil Foden's stoppage-time winner.\n\nFarke added: 'It was definitely a really good away performance and one that gave the players more belief. We were able to give one of the best teams in the world a proper go.'\n\nLe Bris offers support to Mundle after racist abuse\n\nSunderland boss Regis Le Bris has branded racist abuse directed towards Romaine Mundle 'unacceptable'.\n\nThe winger featured from the bench in the Black Cats' 3-1 defeat to Fulham on Sunday on a weekend that saw four separate cases of Premier League players receiving racist abuse and Le Bris reiterated the club's support for Mundle.\n\nRomain Mundle was sent racial abuse on social media after Sunderland's defeat at Fulham\n\n'What happened to Romaine is unacceptable, we stand with him,' said Le Bris. 'There is no room for racism or abuse in football or anywhere else. That's clear for us, we stand for respect, inclusion and diversity, these are the values of football and the values of the club, so it's clear.'\n\nSpeaking about wider racially motivated incidents in football in recent months, he added: 'I don't know really why but I repeat, we don't want to accept that.\n\n'We have to have a clear position and I think it's the case here at Sunderland, we want to defend values and when someone, a group of people, want to threaten those values it's important to react.'\n\nMundle has joined Jocelin Ta Bi, Nordi Mukiele and Brian Brobbey on the sidelines, while Dennis Cirkin and Reinildo Mandava are progressing well after injury but Saturday's game against Bournemouth comes too soon.\n\nLe Bris said: 'About (Mundle's) injury, it might be a difficult injury and he might be sidelined for a few weeks or months. We still have further assessments to make but we'll have a clear picture soon.\n\n'Jocelin might be in the same position as Romaine with a different injury, he might need surgery so a couple of weeks or months, still a bit early as well.\n\n'It will be shorter for Nordi and Brian, between two or four weeks depending on the way they respond to treatments and rehab, so let's wait a bit, but it won't last too long.'\n\nEmery out to win at Wolves...at last\n\nUnai Emery has warned Aston Villa to avoid treating Wolves lightly due to his own poor record against the Premier League’s bottom club.\n\nEmery has never won at Molineux as manager of Arsenal or Villa, losing three of his four games there and drawing the other.\n\n‘We’ve been together three-and-a-half years, and we’ve drawn twice at Molineux and lost once,’ recalled Emery. ‘When I was at Arsenal, we were 3-0 down at half-time (before losing 3-1).\n\nUnai Emery has seen Villa drop off the title pace with just one win in four league games\n\n‘We beat them 1-0 earlier in the season and we didn’t deserve to win. They’ve lost some other games, against Chelsea and Bournemouth, where they haven’t deserved to lose. In their last home game, they drew with Arsenal, the best team in the Premier League and maybe the world.\n\n‘Everything we have analysed makes us feel it is not an easy game, and it’s also a derby. They will want to show what they can do in front of their own fans.’\n\nTom Collomosse\n\nHurzeler's birthday plans: pasta and Forest on TV\n\nBrighton boss Fabian Hurzeler plans to celebrate his 33rd birthday by watching weekend opponents Nottingham Forest over dinner.\n\nRelegation-threatened Forest host Turkish side Fenerbahce on Thursday in the second leg of their Europa League knockout phase play-off before travelling to the Amex Stadium for Sunday's Premier League clash.\n\nHurzeler was presented with a cake ahead of his pre-match press conference and will spend the evening dividing his attention between friends, family, food and Forest.\n\n'I think it will be: here's the iPad with the game and here's my pasta,' he said. 'That's how I expect the evening (to be), and sometimes conversation with others.\n\n'Definitely we will have a look at this game. Of course we already prepared for Nottingham but there are always new things you can see, you adapt.\n\n'It will definitely be a mix of having a good time, good dinner with my friends and family, but also watching a little bit of Nottingham Forest.'\n\nBrighton snapped a six-match winless run in the top flight by beating Brentford 2-0 last weekend to ease growing pressure on Hurzeler.\n\nSeagulls midfielder Yasin Ayari is pushing to feature against Forest following four games out with a dislocated shoulder."

            "content": "Dean Windass fears his children will make the same mistakes he did before his father died - with the Hull City legend revealing he has fallen out with them so badly that he does not even know where son Josh lives.\n\nIn an appearance on Daily Mail Sport podcast Whistleblowers, the ex-footballer - who has been vocal about his previous struggles with substance abuse and suicidal thoughts - detailed the row he had with his father five months before he was killed by a heart attack.\n\nWindass, who suffers from dementia, last month shared a public birthday message to Wrexham star Josh begging him to 'get in touch' and admitted that it was hard not speaking to either of his sons.\n\n'It breaks my heart,' Windass told podcast co-hosts Mark Clattenburg and Gordon Smart. 'I've said that to them, I've texted them. It's just fallen on deaf ears.\n\n'Because I had an argument with my old man, and for five months, I never spoke to him. And for 41 years of my life, he was my best mate. I had a row - don't want to go into it, it was personal - with my kids, and he died in those five months. And it f***ed me up.\n\n'And I blamed myself, and that's when I didn't want to hear from anybody, I didn't want to speak to anybody, I was drinking, trying to commit suicide, all that s***, which is f***ing stupid, looking back now. And yeah, some days, they give you wake-up calls. I went to Sporting Chance (a therapy service for sportspeople) for 26 years, and it was the best 26 years of my life, the rest is history.'\n\nDean Windass has revealed that such is the extent of his estrangement from his sons, he does not even know where Wrexham star Josh lives\n\nAppearing on Whistleblowers, the Premier League cult hero (pictured with Josh) said he is constantly reaching out to both of his sons\n\nHe continued: 'I thought my dad dying was my fault. And it wasn't, he had a heart attack out of the blue, but I'm thinking, \"if I'd have knocked on his door...\" and that's why I don't want my kids to make the same mistake.'\n\nRevealing that he was trying to reach out to Josh and his other son, Jordan, he added: 'I text them every day. And I watched Josh last night, at Wrexham, (he's a) good player, married with a kid - I ain't seen my grandchild for a year.\n\n'It's a tough thing, and people will say, \"why are you mentioning it?\" - but I want to mention it. Because I don't want my kids to make the same mistakes that I made. It's my responsibility as a parent, and I thought it was my dad's responsibility as a parent.\n\n'But when the s*** hit the fan... I was working for Soccer Saturday and this is how stupid it was, I should have done it. I was living in Leeds, and I was driving (to work), I was a little bit early, and I thought, \"f*** it, I'll just pop in at my dad's.\"\n\n'I've not spoken to him for five months. And if I'd have knocked on his door, he'd have f***ing punched me in the face, or whatever, and gone \"come in, give us a kiss\", we'd have had a cry, and it would be all done with. But my attitude was, \"why should I knock on his f***ing door, he's the dad.\"\n\n'And now the roles are reversed with me. I want to knock on Josh's door. I don't even know where he f***ing lives, that's how bad it is, he's in Chester somewhere, or Cheshire, I don't know. And now my youngest son has decided not to speak to me over a family issue. So I don't speak to my two boys.'\n\nSuch is the chasm between father and sons that Josh admitted in 2025 that he did not find out about his father's dementia diagnosis from him directly, but through a friend at a coffee shop.\n\nWindass added: 'The reason why (I speak about this publicly is) if I can get this message over to my children, please don't make the same mistake, because I nearly lost my life for it.'\n\nDespite the distance between them, Windass remains a proud supporter of his sons' achievements, admitting that he was the 'f***ing proudest man in the world' when Josh scored the winning goal at Wembley to send Sheffield Wednesday up to the Championship at the end of the 2022-23 season.\n\nJosh echoed his father's greatest achievement on the pitch, with Windass himself netting the winner in 2008 to see Hull promoted to the Premier League.\n\nJoking that his son's display 'took the heat off' him, he added: 'The kid's a f***ing player, and I'm very proud of it.\n\n\n\n'But that's testament to them. Josh is teetotal, Jordan's teetotal, and I'm f***ing proud of that (too).'"

            "content": "Female footballer outraged after referee is given seven-month suspended prison sentence and fined £1,046 for secretly filming her young team-mates in dressing room\n\nA former SCR Altach women's football player has criticised a court's decision to deliver a man a seven-month suspended prison sentence and fine him £1,046 (€1,200) after he secretly photographed and filmed players in changing rooms and showers.\n\nThe man, who is a former top-level Swiss referee, was accused of secretly recording the young women using a concealed smartphone and through a keyhole during his time as an official at the Austrian football club.\n\nAround 30 players were identified on the recording and pictures. A report also stated that the youngest was born in 2007 and the oldest in 1995.\n\nThe man, who worked at the club between 2020 and 2025, was ordered to pay each victim £544 (€620).\n\nThe case is reported to have shaken football in Austria, with over 100 spectators attending the courtroom in Feldkirch, which is on the border with Switzerland. Although the defendant accepted the verdict, the public prosecutor is yet to decide whether she wants to apply for an appeal.\n\nEleni Rittmann, 25, who played for the top-flight Austrian team at the time, posted an outraged statement on social media.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nEleni Rittmann, 25, who played for the top-flight Austrian team at the time, posted an outraged statement on social media\n\n'This leaves me speechless,' Rittmann, who was not one of the players identified on the seized recordings, said.\n\n'The perpetrator was not only a top-level referee in Switzerland but also an official at Altach. And that is where he filmed players, including minors. I then ask myself, is this an appropriate punishment?\n\n'I also ask myself, does such a punishment act as a deterrent for others? We felt secure in our dressing room and this hurt our privacy so badly that some of us do not feel safe in public showers even now.\n\n'For me this is not a strong enough signal for something that is not tolerated in our society. The verdict is not final as the prosecutor has requested additional time to consider an appeal.'\n\nDuring the trial, a statement from the victims was read out, saying: 'We are young women, partly still young girls. What has happened has pulled the rug from under our feet. For years he told us that the dressing room was our home but this home was then destroyed by someone who we thought was part of this family.'\n\nA lawyer for the victims called the case a 'catastrophe for women's football'.\n\nAustrian sports minister Michaela Schmidt labelled the alleged crimes 'disgusting' in October when they were first reported. 'If female athletes are not even safe in their own dressing rooms because of an official then they have nothing to stand on,' Schmidt said.\n\nAt the beginning of the trial the defendant said: 'I plead partially guilty.'\n\nIt remains unclear whether the images were disseminated. The defence lawyer said it had been established that the photos and videos had not been transferred to a third party and they now will be destroyed.\n\nIn his final words, the defendant addressed the victims to apologise. He said: 'I agree with the statements made by my lawyer, but I would still like to express my sympathy to all those affected and apologise for my actions.'\n\nThe court mitigated the sentence by taking into account his partial confession and his lack of previous convictions.\n\nSCR Altach told Daily Mail Sport that pre-trial they had hosted an information evening for potentially affected players - including parents where minors were involved - where they communicated the facts known about the case at the time. Players were put in touch with legal services, a psychologist, a victim protection organisation, internal club contacts and and the State Criminal Police Office.\n\nWhere players felt unsafe in their own apartments, the club organised alternative accommodation for them.\n\nThe club have also worked to increase the female presence within the support staff of the women's team. A female assistant coach was integrated into the coaching team during the winter break, while a female point of contact within the administrative office to address players' concerns was also designated.\n\n\n\nDaily Mail Sport have contacted the Austrian FA for comment."

But reports in Austrian publication Salzburger Nachrichten claim the German is seeking pastures new, with the quartet of clubs having achieved little success since his arrival.\n\nThey add that things are particularly bad at RB Leipzig, with the club currently fifth in the Bundesliga and in a four-team tussle to secure a qualification spot for the Champions League next season.\n\nSalzburger Nachrichten conclude that Red Bull would not stand in Klopp's way should he wish to return to coaching in the summer - with outgoing Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner already lined up as his replacement. Glasner previously worked at RB Salzburg as an assistant manager between 2012-14.\n\nBut when asked about that report on Thursday, Red Bull CEO Oliver Mintzlaff shut it down and branded it as 'complete nonsense'.\n\nJurgen Klopp will not be leaving Red Bull to make a return to management, insists their CEO\n\nRed Bull CEO Oliver Mintzlaff (left) has rubbished an Austrian report that Klopp will leave\n\n'That is complete nonsense and entirely fabricated,' Mintzlaff told Sky Sports Germany.\n\n'On the contrary: we are extremely satisfied with Jurgen Klopp's work. He invests a great deal of effort, is in constant communication with our coaches and sporting directors, and is sustainably developing our Red Bull football philosophy.\n\n'We are convinced that he is the right man for this job. That is where we are placing all of our focus and energy.'\n\nKlopp has not been in a managerial dugout since leaving Liverpool at the end of the 2023-24 season, citing that he needed to take a break. He has since been linked with a number of jobs this coming summer, including Real Madrid.\n\nSpeaking last week, Klopp's agent revealed that he was approached by Manchester United and Chelsea as well as by England the USA to become their manager once he left the Reds.\n\n'Before joining Red Bull, Jurgen could have coached the USA or England,' said Klopp's long-term representative Marc Kosicke in an interview with German website Transfermarkt.\n\n'Probably also Germany, if Julian Nagelsmann hadn't already been there.\n\n'Even Chelsea and Manchester United inquired, although Jurgen had clearly stated that he would not coach any other club in England. These enquiries keep coming.\n\n'He's extremely happy with what he's achieved. And it's still wonderful to go down in history as one of the few coaches who only managed three clubs and were never fired.'\n\n\n\nWhen approached for comment, both Chelsea and Manchester United denied the agent's claims."

            "content": "American Olympics legend dead at 80 after suffering stroke\n\nFormer US Olympian Jeff Galloway, who revolutionized the sport of distance running, has died at the age of 80.\n\nGalloway passed away on Wednesday afternoon in a Pensacola, Florida hospital after suffering a hemorrhagic stroke, according to his daughter-in-law.\n\n'Jeff spent his life proving that anyone could cross a finish line. He celebrated every mile, every walk break, and every finish. He coached millions, but found fulfillment in each of your stories of personal accomplishment,' his family said in a statement.\n\n'He empowered people to believe in themselves. He is survived by every person who ever crossed a finish line and thought, 'I didn't think I could do this'.\n\n'Jeff had an almost supernatural ability to look at any person, any age, any fitness level and see not what they were, but what they could become, in fitness and in life.'\n\nHe is survived by his two sons and six grandchildren.\n\nJeff Galloway, who revolutionized the sport of distance running, has died at the age of 80\n\nThe 1972 Olympian, pictured with one of his grandchildren, suffered a hemorrhagic stroke\n\nThe 1972 Olympian was a cornerstone of the American running boom and is credited with making the marathon distance accessible to millions of amateurs.\n\nGalloway was named on the US Olympic team for the 1972 Games in the 10,000 meters and could have also taken part in the marathon but ended up as an alternate at the event due to a selfless act that saw his teammate earn a spot instead.\n\nAt the marathon trials, Galloway had been in third-place throughout before stepping aside at the finish line to allow his friend to clinch third and a place on the team.\n\nMeanwhile, his signature Run-Walk-Run method encouraged participants to take strategic walking breaks to manage fatigue and reduce the risk of common injuries.\n\nGalloway famously applied his own logic during the 1980 Houston Marathon, where he utilized walk breaks at every water station to finish in 2:16:35.\n\nThat performance in Houston stood as a testament to his endurance, as he finished the 26.2-mile course faster than his previous 'run-only' efforts.\n\nBeyond his coaching, Galloway was a highly decorated competitive athlete who earned All-American honors while competing for Florida State University.\n\nIn 1970, he won the inaugural Peachtree Road Race in Atlanta, a 10-kilometer event that has since grown into the world's largest race of its kind.\n\n\n\nAlong with his endeavors on the track, Galloway also funded a number of running stores, group and camps to help people get involved in the sport."

            "content": "Ian Wright suggested that some of Tottenham's biggest stars are unwilling to give new interim manager Igor Tudor a chance, after Micky Van de Ven appeared to blank him during the north London derby.\n\nAppointed following the overdue sacking of Thomas Frank earlier this month, Tudor arrived with the challenging brief of ensuring that Spurs avoid relegation at the end of the season.\n\nThe Europa League champions currently sit 16th and only four points away from 18th-placed West Ham - and Tudor's arrival in the capital was made no easier by his first match in charge being the north London derby.\n\nAs Spurs fell 4-1 to Arsenal at home, Tudor was spotted apparently giving vocal instructions to Van de Ven from the sidelines, only for the defender to fail to acknowledge him.\n\nFor Wright, that the players were not eager to engage with their new head coach was a troubling sign.\n\n'Against Arsenal I saw Igor Tudor try to speak to Van de Ven, he blanked him, totally blanked him,' Wright said to his co-hosts on The Overlap's Stick To Football podcast.\n\nIgor Tudor appeared to be ignored by Micky Van de Ven just days into his tenure as Tottenham interim head coach\n\n'That says to me they have checked out already.'\n\nGary Neville thought that Wright's verdict was a 'harsh' one, while Roy Keane argued that the players 'did that with' Frank, but the Arsenal legend was in no mood to back down.\n\n'This guy is new, he wants him to come up and Van de Ven just looks at him and stays there,' Wright continued. 'You think to yourself, that doesn't look good. That does not look good'.\n\nFor his part, Tudor denied conflict between himself and Van de Ven on Thursday afternoon, sharing that he had been addressing the whole team.\n\n'If you watch carefully, I don't speak to him (in that moment),' Tudor said in his pre-Premier League weekend press conference. 'Afterwards, I said to him to come closer, and he comes closer.\n\n'We didn't talk about it because nothing happened. He's a fantastic professional and a fantastic guy, he would not do something like (ignoring me).'\n\nBelgium head coach Roberto Martinez stressed that whatever Tudor can do to ensure Spurs do not spend next season in the Championship, his first order of business should be 'accepting where they are' at this stage in the campaign.\n\n'When I was at Wigan you almost prepared for that last third of the season because that is your opportunity,' Martinez said. 'The last third for us was that we are going to get out of trouble.\n\n'The problem is when you are going into the last third hoping you are not going to get dragged down into a relegation battle because your club wasn't ready for that. This is where it becomes very very dangerous.\n\nThe stop-gap manager has a challenging task attempting to keep Spurs from the drop - and began his reign with a dismal north London derby\n\n'What happens now is that you should forget about these general terms that \"we shouldn't get dragged down\", what does this mean to a player (looking to hear) \"do I need to run more, less\".\n\n'It is basic language (you use to a player) about everything you can control, \"you have to do 12km, six sprints into the box and run to the near post\". Everything has to be so measurable. It is about winning the next game.'\n\nSpurs' torrid winter has been only exacerbated by a number of injuries to key players leaving their squad painfully short.\n\nBut Martinez was keen to warn that Spurs should not rely on waiting for stars to return to expect fortunes to change.\n\n'I think Spurs will get one or two players back from injury, you win a game and then you have got too much (of a gap),' he added.\n\n'The problem is there are no easy games in the Premier League. As a player at Spurs you might think there are easy games we can win, no - there are no easy games. It is about reducing that to, it is the next game and you have an opportunity to get points rather than if you don't win and you are out.\n\n'The moment that the club see it as \"wow, if we don't win...\" - the mindset is so negative and it drags you down. We have seen teams that are \"too good to go down\" go down because they weren't prepared for that final third of the season.'\n\nSpurs will stay in London for their next Premier League test, travelling to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Sunday."

            "content": "Lando Norris' ex-girlfriend has made her first public post since their split, choosing to make a comment on his latest Instagram photo.\n\nLast week it was confirmed that Norris, 26, and Magui Corceiro, 23, had gone their separate ways in the latest development of their on-and-off relationship that has been going on since 2023.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Wednesday, Norris uploaded snaps from his off-season break in the snow during the recent festive period - with the photo dump captioned: 'Left this draft in the freezer'.\n\nIn the first picture in the sequence, Norris can be seen wrapped up warmly, while wearing some red tartan bottoms.\n\nAnd that photo caught the eye of Corceiro who commented: 'Nice pjs, u [sic] welcome.'\n\nThe turnaround in their relationship is in stark contrast to two months ago when the Brit celebrated his maiden F1 world title with his then-Portuguese supermodel partner in Abu Dhabi.\n\nLando Norris' ex-girlfriend Magui Corceiro commented on this Instagram photo on Wednesday\n\nThe British driver, 26, had been dating the Portuguese supermodel, 23, on-and-off for years\n\nIndications of their split came last week when a video clip from testing in Bahrain set tongues wagging when Norris was seemingly overheard telling F1 rival Carlos Sainz that he is 'a single man'.\n\nIn a TikTok clip, Sainz can be heard asking Norris: 'Are you and Magui good?'\n\nNorris appears to respond 'no', adding he is 'a single man', though the quality of the audio had led to uncertainty as to what the Briton actually said.\n\nBut now the split has been confirmed by F1 insider Kym Illman, in a video posted to Instagram.\n\nThe correspondent told his audience of 881,000 followers that rumours of a split between the pair are 'definitely true'.\n\nIn a round-up of the day's action in Bahrain, he said: 'Lando Norris was in fine form this morning, looking good.\n\n'You may read this tomorrow... but he has broken up with his girlfriend Magui. You might have already heard rumours but it is definitely true.'\n\nNorris and Corceiro, who used to go out with footballer Joao Felix, broke up in 2024 before getting back together last year but it seems they have called it quits again.\n\nNorris set tongues wagging when he appeared to tell Carlos Sainz he is 'a single man'\n\nAccording to the Sun: 'There have been tell-tale signs for a while now.\n\n'They drifted apart after his win last season. The biggest hint came in Bahrain as he and his team continued testing ahead of the new season.\n\n'Lando held a party to thank those who have been with him from the start and who he credits with helping him lift the title.\n\n'Anyone who was anyone posed for a group picture. The only one who wasn’t there was girlfriend Magui. It naturally sparked rumours.'\n\nOnly last December, Corceiro broke down in tears after watching Norris triumph to take the world championship.\n\nIn the week that followed, the model and actress gave an interview with TV Guia, saying: 'There's no rule for going public,' she said. 'I thought it (the kiss in Abu Dhabi) made sense. I'm very happy, he's very happy, and that's what matters.\n\n'At that moment I forgot the cameras were there. It was such an important moment that I didn't even remember that.'\n\nCorceiro was in attendance for the post-victory celebrations along with his parents Adam and Cisca, his brother Oliver and the McLaren team.\n\nIt's understood the group partied through the night until 6am on Monday, racking up a bill worth around £100,000 across the hotel bars they visited.\n\nCorceiro hails from Santarem in Portugal and has amassed a colossal social media following including 800,000 fans on TikTok.\n\nPortuguese influencer Corceiro dated Norris on-and-off since 2023 but they have now 'split'\n\nThe stars' relationship was one of the more high profile on the Formula One grid\n\nAs an actress, she has appeared in Portuguese television dramas and is regularly featured in campaigns, including stints for Intimissimi and Alo Yoga.\n\nCorceiro was a contestant in the country's version of Dancing with the Stars back in 2020.\n\nShe also co-founded the eco-conscious swimwear brand Missus and has graced the pages of Vogue Portugal.\n\nIt was on his own appearance in Vogue that Norris first gushed about Corceiro.\n\n'We met a few years ago, but we were never really together,' he said. 'Until more recently.'\n\nWhen asked what was 'special' about her, he replied: 'Everything. She's someone I can very much be myself with. Very down to earth and she lives quite a crazy life as well. It's nice when we can both just [rent] a boat for the day or go home together and chill.'\n\n'The biggest thing I'm trying to change is to get her into golf. She hates golf.'\n\nBut the relationship appears to have come to an end, though neither party have yet confirmed the split on their official channels."

For older fans, Dallas Cowboys did the double and I was big fan of the Dallas Cowboys when American Football first came to England.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I was looking at those teams and their culture. How they pushed on, how they improved and got even better in their subsequent season.”\n\nStability is crucial to a title defence and London Pulse have been able to retain nine of last season’s squad with South African Kamogelo Maseko the only new face in the team.\n\nPerhaps the most important player to keep hold of was Player of the Final Funmi Fadoju, a star defender for both Pulse and England, who had interest from Australia ’s Suncorp Super Netball.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Zara Everitt lifts the 2025 Netball Super League trophy\n\nBird added: “A fair few clubs in Australia have been after Funmi for many years, this year was not unusual, and it is usually multiple clubs interested.\n\n“Funmi is very connected to London, very happy in our club, and she is still improving in her netball, in the England programme and at Pulse. Athletes need to be happy away from the court and she has got a really good netball-life balance here.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Knowing the club is super ambitious and knowing that we want to push Funmi on to continue to become an even better player made the decision quite a comfortable one for her.\n\n“At some point, she will probably end up in Australia but it has to be the right time for Funmi, and people forget how young she is still.”\n\nPulse begin their season against perennial challengers Manchester Thunder at home, but they may learn more about their title challenge away in the reverse fixture, which will be in Liverpool. That is because Manchester will host the first northern-based Soft & Gentle Grand Final on 20 June.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHaving won the 2025 Grand Final on home turf at London’s O2, Bird and her charges are excited for the chance to triumph in enemy territory.\n\n“The fanbase and netball in Manchester are both strong,” she said. “Manchester-London is a natural rivalry and has been for years. Thunder fans are really loud. It will be a real hothouse. The difference with our team now to maybe two or three years ago is they will almost absorb that and use that energy for themselves.\n\n“Before it might have been a threat but now they are comfortable and confident enough to play in any environment. It is almost a nice spin for us, having won in London, to try and win in Manchester it is another ambition for us to try and meet.”\n\nArticle continues below"

Despite growing up in California, the 22-year-old chose to represent China - a decision she was able to make due to her mother's heritage.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite striking gold in the women's halfpipe event at the 2026 Winter Olympics, Gu could only manage silvers in the big air and slopestyle disciplines. When a reporter asked if the two silvers felt more like two lost golds, Gu had a sharp retort which drew further backlash.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe responded: \"I am the most decorated female freeskier in history; I think that is an answer in and of itself. Winning a medal at the Olympics is a life-changing experience for every athlete; doing it five times is exponentially harder.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The two medals-lost situation, to be quite frank, I think is a ridiculous perspective to take. I am showcasing my best skiing, I am quite literally doing things that have never been done before, and so I think that is more than good enough, but thank you.\"\n\nAmerican journalist Megan Basham took particular issue with Gu's response, sharing a video of the exchange online and accusing the skier of arrogance. She posted: \"I'm sorry, but even beyond betraying her country, this woman is awful.\n\nWinter Olympics reporter whose Eileen Gu question went viral responds to backlash READ MORE :\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! All the best sports news and much more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Off-the-chart levels of arrogance. I don't care how many medals she has, there is nothing about her I would encourage my daughters to emulate.\"\n\nUnhappy with Basham's view, Woods stepped in to support Gu. Sharing the journalist's opinion, the TNT Sports presenter wrote: \"Find these takes baffling.\n\n\"Why is confidence and pride always reframed as arrogance? You don't get to the top level without self belief.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Why is it necessary to be coy about your achievements?

The mistake left viewers at home furious after the live broadcast suddenly switched to an episode of A League of Their Own.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe SSE Arena played host to Night 1 in Belfast as the previous season kicked off. Luke Humphries was cruising towards victory in the opening night final against Chris Dobey when TV viewers were disrupted.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe 31-year-old looked set to claim the £10,000 prize money and five points but the TV coverage unexpectedly switched to A League of Their Own during the last leg. Luckily, the error, which mainly affected Sky Sports Mix and Sky Showcase for roughly 45 seconds, was resolved before Humphries threw his final darts.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite the quick correction, the incident still prompted a wave of angry reactions across social media. One disgruntled darts fan posted on X: \"Sky Sports cutting the end of the darts coverage? What an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

Ffs.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLuke Littler showed true colours after his behaviour was called out by darts rival READ MORE :\n\nMichael van Gerwen gives health update after Premier League absence READ MORE :\n\nOne furious viewer directed their anger at the broadcaster: \"Why did you decide to switch the Premier League Darts to 'A League of Their Own' just as the final comes to a climax? Utterly shambolic. Name the person that thought that was an acceptable thing to do and advise what their punishment will be.\"\n\nHumphries wrapped up his commanding 6-1 victory over Dobey shortly after Sky Sports switched back to the coverage. However, the defending Premier League champion is still hunting his first night victory of the current season.\n\nNewcastle's opening night went to Michael van Gerwen, with Gerwyn Price and Jonny Clayton following up with wins in Antwerp and Glasgow, respectively. Clayton sits top of the table by a single point after three nights, having secured one victory and two semi-final appearances.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Luke Humphries will aim to repeat his Premier League Darts win in Belfast (Image: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images)\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nFor a team with the cachet of Duke, it's a testament to the strength of this season's contenders that it took this long for the Blue Devils to rise to No. 1 in the AP poll and these Power Rankings.\n\nBut there was zero debate about their ascension this week, particularly after they looked so impressive in their win over Michigan in Washington D.C. on Saturday night. They looked every bit like the nation's best defensive team, keeping the Wolverines off the offensive glass and out of transition. And while the Blue Devils don't look as explosive on the offensive end as some of the other top teams, they sandwiched that Michigan win with two games against Syracuse and Notre Dame in which they scored 201 total points.\n\n(Of course, it helps that they have National Player of the Year favorite Cameron Boozer leading the way.)\n\nThe question now becomes: Can any team pass Duke -- or do the Blue Devils have the inside track to the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament?\n\nThey have three games to go: vs. Virginia, at NC State and vs. North Carolina. Three top-30-caliber opponents; three chances to improve their 1-seed profile. They are first in the NET, third in average résumé metrics and second in average predictive metrics. And they are tied with Arizona with 12 Quadrant 1 wins.\n\nThe Blue Devils would have to lose in order to lose their position, and with less than three weeks until Selection Sunday, they have the edge moving forward.\n\nPrevious ranking: 2\n\nJon Scheyer isn't getting enough credit for the coaching job he's done this season, with limited buzz for National Coach of the Year honors. Sure, it's Duke, and he has the best player in the country headlining the No. 1 recruiting class. But the Blue Devils are the No. 1 team with just two losses all season, with both coming in the final seconds. They were picked outside the top five in the preseason. They aren't nearly as talented as last year's roster yet are on track to be the No. 1 overall seed on Selection Sunday -- something last year's team didn't accomplish.\n\nScheyer also became the first head coach in ACC history with multiple 40-point road wins against ACC opponents when Duke beat Notre Dame by 44 on Tuesday.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Virginia (Feb. 28), at NC State (March 2)\n\nPrevious ranking: 3\n\nJaden Bradley and Brayden Burries might not put up the stats of some of the other elite guards around the country, but there are very few players Tommy Lloyd would rather have late in games than the two backcourt stars. Bradley is one of the most clutch players in the country, while Burries' late-game performance against Baylor was one of the more impressive stretches we've seen from any freshman guard this season. The two players combined for 26 points and seven assists in the second half against the Bears, finishing with 49 points and 10 assists. That came after Bradley went for 17 points against Houston and Burries hit a slew of clutch free throws.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Kansas (Feb. 28), vs. Iowa State (March 2)\n\nplay 1:17 Arizona Wildcats vs. Baylor Bears: Game Highlights Arizona Wildcats vs. Baylor Bears: Game Highlights\n\nPrevious ranking: 1\n\nWhile most of the focus has been on the frontcourt, the Wolverines' guards are starting to look like the catalyst for their success moving forward. Take the past three games, for example. Against Purdue, Elliot Cadeau, Trey McKenney and L.J. Cason combined for 43 points and seven 3s. Against Duke, the three guards totaled only 17 points and two 3-pointers. And against Minnesota on Tuesday, the trio went for 41 points and 11 3-pointers. It's easy to deduce which game Michigan lost of those three. Dusty May needs his guards to play well -- and make shots.\n\nNext seven days: at Illinois (Feb. 27)\n\nPrevious ranking: 6\n\nIf UConn's uneven performances during most of Big East play -- close wins over inferior teams, a home loss to Creighton -- had anyone questioning the Huskies' national championship credentials, those concerns were likely assuaged Wednesday. They had an all-time dominant performance against St. John's, beating the Red Storm by 32 in the biggest victory in series history. It also came on the heels of a double-digit win at Villanova over the weekend.\n\nTarris Reed Jr. was the best player on the floor in both games, particularly against St. John's, finishing with 20 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, six blocks and two steals. According to ESPN Research, he became just the third UConn player in the past 30 seasons to post over 20 points, 10-plus rebounds and five-plus blocks against a ranked opponent.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Seton Hall (Feb. 28)\n\nPrevious ranking: 4\n\nWhile Killyan Toure has emerged as the breakout freshman for the Cyclones, TJ Otzelberger is beginning to get consistent production from another first-year player. Jamarion Batemon was generating significant buzz in the offseason, but his role fluctuated during the first couple months of the season. Over the past four games, though, he has hit double figures three times while making multiple 3-pointers in three of the games. He had 11 points and three 3s against Kansas, 14 points in a loss to BYU and 13 points in Tuesday's win over Utah.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Texas Tech (Feb. 28), at Arizona (March 2)\n\nPrevious ranking: 8\n\nFlorida's winning streak was at risk in Austin on Wednesday, with Texas taking a three-point lead with 7:27 remaining -- but the Longhorns didn't make another shot.\n\nAlex Condon again led the way for the Gators: He finished with 23 points, four rebounds, three assists and four blocks, going 10-for-12 from the field. That performance came after going for 24 points, four rebounds and six assists on 9-for-13 shooting in a win over Ole Miss over the weekend. That followed a 20-point, 10-rebound effort against South Carolina last week. Before this three-game stretch, Condon had scored 20 points just four times all season.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Arkansas (Feb. 28), vs. Mississippi State (March 3)\n\nplay 1:19 Florida Gators vs. Texas Longhorns: Game Highlights Florida Gators vs. Texas Longhorns: Game Highlights\n\nPrevious ranking: 9\n\nWhile Purdue's loss to Michigan came in its highest profile game of the month, impacting perceptions of the Boilermakers' ceiling, the team is playing some of its best offensive basketball over the past couple weeks. On Feb. 1, the Boilermakers scored 1.45 points per possession against Maryland. On Feb. 14, they scored 1.35 points per possession against Iowa. And on Friday against Indiana, they scored 1.47 points per possession. Against the Hoosiers, Purdue shot 70% on 2s, 56% on 3s and had 24 assists on 33 made shots. It was remarkably efficient offense.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Michigan State (Feb. 26), at Ohio State (March 1), at Northwestern (March 4)\n\nPrevious ranking: 5\n\nHouston is in the midst of its first three-game losing streak in nine seasons, and while its defense -- specifically its inability to force turnovers against Iowa State and Arizona -- is partially to blame, the Cougars' shotmakers are becoming an issue. Since the Cougars don't have a reliable inside scorer in the mold of what J'Wan Roberts had been for the previous three seasons, there's more pressure on Kingston Flemings, Emanuel Sharp and Milos Uzan to carry the offense. Flemings is shooting just 34.7% over his past five games; Sharp is shooting 21.9% during the losing streak; and Uzan is averaging 9.3 points on 38.5% in his past six games.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Colorado (Feb. 28), vs. Baylor (March 4)\n\nPrevious ranking: 7\n\nIllinois has lost three of its past five games, with all three coming in overtime. Only one of the Illini's six losses this season has come by more than four points. The problem hasn't been their offense; it's a defense that allowed at least 1.19 points per possession in each of their three losses this month. Over that recent five-game stretch, their defense is ranked No. 60 in adjusted efficiency at advanced analytics site BartTorvik, with teams shooting better than 36% from 3 over that span. In their six losses, opponents have made an average of 11.5 3s.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Michigan (Feb. 27), vs. Oregon (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 10\n\nIt's not often a team has a 29-point swing in back-to-back games against Cincinnati and Houston, but that's what Kansas did over the past week. The Jayhawks were steamrolled by the Bearcats in the second half on Saturday but turned around to hand Houston its third straight loss on Monday. Kansas' defense was fantastic against Houston, holding it to 0.86 points per possession and limiting it to 5-for-24 shooting from the perimeter. In the Jayhawks' seven losses, their defense is ranked No. 208 nationally at CBB Analytics, shooting nearly 57% from inside the arc.\n\nNext seven days: at Arizona (Feb. 28), at Arizona State (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 11\n\nSince returning from a three-game absence due to an ankle injury, Graham Ike has been playing some of the best basketball of his college career. In his eight games since returning, Ike is averaging 23.9 points and 7.6 rebounds while shooting 58.5% from the field and 37.9% from 3-point range. He made three 3-pointers twice during that span, which is notable given he made six total 3s in his first 78 college games. The Zags also avenged their lone WCC loss this season with a 41-point win over Portland on Wednesday, when Ike had 19 points, eight boards and a career-high seven steals.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Portland (Feb. 25), at Saint Mary's (Feb. 28)\n\nPrevious ranking: 13\n\nNebraska has righted the ship over the past two games, beating Penn State and Maryland after losing four of its previous six. There are a couple headlines for the recent stretch. One, the Cornhuskers have tightened things defensively. They allowed at least 1.05 points per possession three times in a four-game stretch between Jan. 27 and Feb. 10. They haven't allowed any opponent to score more than 0.96 since then, with their past four opponents averaging 57.8 points. The other is Pryce Sandfort, who had 33 points against Penn State and is averaging 20.8 points and shooting 42.4% from 3 in his past 12 games.\n\nNext seven days: at USC (Feb. 28), at UCLA (March 3)\n\nplay 0:13 Pryce Sandfort drops in the smooth basket Pryce Sandfort drops in the smooth basket.\n\nPrevious ranking: 12\n\nMichigan State has bounced back after a 1-3 stretch between the end of January and early February, blowing out UCLA and then coming back down the stretch to beat Ohio State on Sunday. Carson Cooper's return to form could be key for Tom Izzo. After failing to score in double figures in any of the aforementioned four-game stretch, Cooper had 12 points and seven boards against UCLA before finishing with a season-high 20 points and 11 rebounds on 7-for-10 shooting in the win over Ohio State. He is averaging 11.1 points in Michigan State's wins this season, compared to just 6.8 in its losses.\n\nNext seven days: at Purdue (Feb. 26), at Indiana (March 1)\n\nPrevious ranking: 14\n\nTexas Tech had its first two full games without JT Toppin this week, and the Red Raiders dispatched Kansas State and Cincinnati with relative ease. While Christian Anderson was already one of the highest-usage guards in the country before Toppin's injury, Tech is going to go as far as its All-American point guard can carry it. In the two games since Toppin's injury, Anderson is averaging 26.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists, while shooting 59.3% from the field and 42.9% from 3. A date with Iowa State's elite perimeter defenders is up next.\n\nNext seven days: at Iowa State (Feb. 28), vs. TCU (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 15\n\nVirginia has a chance to move into first place in the ACC and gain the inside track to a conference regular-season title with a win at Duke on Saturday at noon. The Cavaliers, picked fifth in the league's preseason poll, won their ninth game in a row Tuesday with a 29-point blowout of NC State. Ryan Odom will need Jacari White to continue his hot perimeter shooting against the Blue Devils. After not scoring in double figures since mid-December, White has hit that threshold three times in the past five games, including 15 points against the Wolfpack. He's now shooting 57.1% from 3 over his past five games.\n\nNext seven days: at Duke (Feb. 28), vs. Wake Forest (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 17\n\nNate Oats' team is starting to hit its stride, winning seven games in a row while scoring at least 89 points in each and reaching the 100-point mark in three of them. The schedule stiffens to end the season, with road games at Tennessee and Georgia followed by a rivalry game against Auburn in the finale. The Tide made 16 3-pointers in the first half of Wednesday's win against Mississippi State, scoring 63 points before halftime -- and they did it without Labaron Philon Jr. Freshman Amari Allen had the best offensive game of his career, finishing with 23 points and going 6-for-7 from 3.\n\nNext seven days: at Tennessee (Feb. 28), at Georgia (March 3)\n\nplay 1:17 Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Alabama Crimson Tide: Game Highlights Mississippi State Bulldogs vs. Alabama Crimson Tide: Game Highlights\n\nPrevious ranking: 18\n\nBilly Richmond has been one of the biggest late-season breakout stars of the 2025-26 campaign. He had a couple of spot starts in November and January but had otherwise been exclusively a bench player for the first season and a half of his career. John Calipari thrust Richmond into the starting lineup when Karter Knox suffered an injury, and he has emerged as the team's most reliable scorer not named Darius Acuff Jr. Richmond has scored at least 20 points in four straight games, doing almost all of his damage in transition and inside the arc. He's averaging 22.3 points and 3.3 assists over that span, while also logging eight steals and five blocks. With Acuff struggling for the early part of Wednesday's win over Texas A&M, Richmond stepped up with 23 points on 13 shots.\n\nNext seven days: at Florida (Feb. 28), vs. Texas (March 4)\n\nPrevious ranking: 20\n\nA road win at Vanderbilt on Saturday vaulted the Vols over the Commodores in the rankings, but Tennessee followed it with a four-point road loss at Missouri. One thing to monitor is the performance of the Vols' top three scorers. Ja'Kobi Gillespie and Nate Ament struggled in the second half of the loss to Mizzou, combining to shoot 5-for-19 from the field and 1-for-7 from 3. Ament is 8-for-27 in his past two games. Then there's J.P. Estrella, who missed two games with a foot injury but returned against Mizzou to play only six minutes. Rick Barnes hopes Estrella returns to full strength soon.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Alabama (Feb. 28), at South Carolina (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 19\n\nVanderbilt snapped its two-game losing streak with a win over Georgia on Wednesday, but the most positive development of the past week for the Commodores is arguably the return of Duke Miles. The senior guard had missed seven straight games after undergoing knee surgery but returned against Tennessee over the weekend. He has come off the bench in each of his two games back, but still totaled 27 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, four steals and zero turnovers. He also shot 5-for-11 from 3 in the two games.\n\nNext seven days: at Kentucky (Feb. 28), at Ole Miss (March 3)\n\nMen's Tournament Challenge Sign up now to play the #1 Men's bracket game for FREE! $125,000 in prizes.\n\nPlay Men's Tournament Challenge\n\nPrevious ranking: 21\n\nCarolina is 3-1 without Caleb Wilson, with back-to-back wins since getting Henri Veesaar back from his two-game absence. While the return of Veesaar -- and the 30-point performance from Seth Trimble against Louisville -- have been the headliners, it's worth highlighting how productive Zayden High has been since Wilson got hurt. High was barely part of the rotation for the first 24 games, seeing double-figure minutes just twice, and that was in early November. But in his past four games, High is averaging 10.3 points and 8.5 rebounds, bringing an edge the Tar Heels have lacked at times.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Virginia Tech (Feb. 28), vs. Clemson (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 16\n\nThe Red Storm's defeat at UConn on Wednesday was as eye-opening a loss as any team in college basketball has suffered this season. It wasn't just the final 32-point margin -- although it was Rick Pitino's second-largest loss as the coach of a ranked team. It was the way it happened. The Red Storm were awful offensively. They shot 2-for-28 from the field in the second half. Their final basket came with 17:28 remaining, missing their last 24 shots from the field. According to ESPN Research, the 24 straight misses was the longest game-ending streak by a Division I team in at least the past eight seasons.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Villanova (Feb. 28), vs. Georgetown (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: 22\n\nLouisville is likely to end the regular season without beating a ranked opponent. The Cardinals' best wins have come at home against NC State, SMU and Kentucky, plus a neutral site win over Indiana. They have six Quadrant 1 wins, but they're 0-6 in Quadrant 1A contests. In those Quadrant 1A games, Louisville is No. 62 in the country in adjusted efficiency margin at BartTorvik. Two big statistical gaps stand out when comparing wins and losses. In wins, the Cardinals shoot 39.3% from 3 and just 28.8% in losses. They also attempt more than 23 free throws per game in wins and fewer than 16 in losses.\n\nNext seven days: at Clemson (Feb. 28), vs. Syracuse (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: Not ranked\n\nThree days after BYU's biggest win of the season -- a 10-point victory over Iowa State -- the Cougars suffered a surprising 13-point loss at home to UCF, in a game they trailed by as many as 36 points in the second half. From a body-of-work résumé perspective, BYU still has the profile of a 6-seed or a Top 25 team. The Cougars are top 25 in six of seven team sheet metrics, with 12 wins over Quadrant 1 and 2 opponents. The marquee win over Iowa State adds serious heft to a group of wins that already included Villanova, Wisconsin, Miami and Clemson. But they're 3-6 in their past nine games and a 1-2 record without Richie Saunders (including a blowout home loss to UCF) leaves them at risk of tumbling further.\n\nNext seven days: at West Virginia (Feb. 28), at Cincinnati (March 3)\n\nPrevious ranking: Not ranked\n\nIt's fitting Saint Mary's finds its way into the rankings just before the final Gonzaga-Saint Mary's matchup as conference foes (the Zags leave the WCC for the Pac-12 this summer). The Gaels could still earn a share of the regular-season title with a win Saturday, which would be their fourth WCC title in a row. They've also beaten Gonzaga at least once in each of the past four seasons -- though they lost the first game this season, 73-65. Saint Mary's enters the weekend with momentum, winner of seven in a row after Wednesday's 19-point victory over Santa Clara. Mikey Lewis has been playing his best basketball since the opening weeks, averaging 16.2 points over his last six games.\n\nNext seven days: vs. Gonzaga (Feb. 28)\n\nPrevious ranking: 25\n\nAfter that stretch of games in the middle of conference play when the RedHawks were barely escaping with wins, they're leaving absolutely zero doubt over the past several games. They've won their past five games by an average of 13 points, leading by at least 20 points in four of those five games. Forward Almar Atlason, an Iceland native and one of the best reserves in the MAC, might be returning to his early-season form, too. Atlason hit double figures in 10 of his first 13 games this season, then did it just once over his next 10. But he's hit that mark in four of his past five games, giving Travis Steele another player who can stretch it from beyond the arc.\n\nNext seven days: at Western Michigan (Feb. 27), vs. Toledo (March 3)\n\nDropped out: Saint Louis Billikens (No. 23), Utah State Aggies (No. 24)"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThe 2026 men's NCAA tournament is rapidly approaching, which means the question top of mind for many fans is: Will your team be in or out? Teams have roughly three weeks until Selection Sunday to strengthen their cases. Until then, we're here to track how each team on the \"bubble\" of the bracket is trending.\n\nWe'll use a variety of metrics as guides, classifying teams based on how likely they are to make the field of 68 as one of the 37 at-large selections -- conditional on not winning their respective conference tournaments for one of the 31 automatic qualifying bids (AQs). To that end, we'll use Joe Lunardi's Bracketology projections and a combination of data sources -- including my forecast-model consensus and NCAA résumé metrics such as NET rankings that the selection committee will evaluate -- to judge a team's underlying potential. (For a full glossary of terms and sources, click here or scroll to the bottom of this story.)\n\nWe'll sort teams in at-large contention into the following categories:\n\nLocks: Teams that have nearly a 100% chance to be called by the committee as an at-large selection (if necessary). They would need a significant change in momentum to miss the cut. 27 current teams\n\nShould be in: Teams tracking safely above the cutline (generally 75% consensus at-large odds or better), but not immune to trouble. Most likely, these teams should hear their names called on March 15, though their fates are not yet assured. 12 current teams\n\nWork to do: Teams whose upcoming results will meaningfully change their fate (for good or bad). These are the truest \"on the bubble\" teams, because their chances are closest to a coin flip, though their consensus at-large odds may be as low as 10%. 16 current teams\n\nTeams beyond these categories would need to outperform expectations or benefit from chaos. There is little -- though not zero -- chance any team not listed here will make the Big Dance without winning its conference tournament.\n\nNow let's go conference by conference -- in order of which project to have the most NCAA tournament bids -- to rank the teams in each category based on their chances to secure an at-large bid.\n\nNote: All times Eastern.\n\nJump to a conference:\n\nSEC | Big Ten | ACC\n\nBig 12 | Big East\n\nMid-majors\n\nSEC\n\n9.9 expected bids (8.9 at-large)\n\nLocks (5)\n\nFlorida Gators\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide\n\nVanderbilt Commodores\n\nArkansas Razorbacks\n\nTennessee Volunteers\n\nShould be in (4)\n\nKentucky Wildcats\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:22 p.m.\n\nThree consecutive losses -- to Florida, Georgia and Auburn -- meant we had to downgrade Kentucky from a \"lock\" recently, but the Wildcats got back to business with a win at South Carolina on Tuesday. Their résumé features five Quadrant 1 wins, enough to rank around the top 30 nationally in our résumé average, and is still comfortably sixth best in the SEC, which projects to send as many as 11 teams in the latest Bracketology. Even with 10 losses, it helps that seven came to Quadrant 1A foes. A bigger concern is that they still have one of the nation's toughest remaining schedules, with all three games against Quadrant 1 foes (including a Quadrant 1A in Florida).\n\nNext game: vs. Vanderbilt (Saturday)\n\nGeorgia Bulldogs\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 9:10 p.m.\n\nComing off résumé-boosting wins over Kentucky and Texas, Georgia fell short in a comeback bid for another after falling behind big early at Vanderbilt on Wednesday. It has been a roller-coaster season for the Dawgs: After winning 16 of their first 19 games, they lost five of their next six and fell from a 97% to 66% consensus at-large chance in the span of three weeks -- but those chances are back up around 90% despite the loss to the Commodores. Georgia sits mid-30s in the overall résumé rankings, with four wins against Quadrant 1 foes, and ranks seventh in résumé average within what should be at least a 10-bid SEC. Toward the end of a challenging stretch of games, the Dawgs have the conference's easiest remaining schedule according to the BPI, so they should pick up a couple of additional wins.\n\nNext game: vs. South Carolina (Saturday)\n\nMissouri Tigers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:41 a.m.\n\nComing off Saturday's loss at Arkansas -- their second in three games -- the Tigers needed a win to stabilize their at-large chances, and they got it hosting Tennessee on Tuesday. They still rank just 11th among SEC teams in the résumé average (borderline mid-40s nationally), a scary spot to be in with the conference projected for 10-11 tournament entries. They have five Quadrant 1 wins, though, and in many ways are the anti-Auburn in terms of what the committee might value more: They have a much better record (19-9 vs. 15-13) against a much easier schedule (63rd hardest vs. fourth). After Tuesday night, the at-large forecast models now favor Mizzou (78%) over Auburn (58%), which is why Dennis Gates' team now sits here -- with a much easier case to argue for itself from a W-L perspective.\n\nNext game: at Mississippi State (Saturday)\n\nTexas A&M Aggies\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 11:17 p.m.\n\nThe Aggies recently found themselves downgraded from \"should be in\" to \"work to do,\" but a remarkable comeback against Ole Miss followed by a solid victory at Oklahoma helped their tournament hopes. With Wednesday's one-sided loss at Arkansas, though, their consensus at-large chances stay in the mid-70% range. They rank ninth in the résumé average out of what's looking like a 10- to 11-bid SEC, so they are on the right side of the bubble, but Bucky McMillan's squad probably needs to bolster their case against Texas, Kentucky and/or LSU to close the regular season.\n\nNext game: vs. Texas (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (2)\n\nTexas Longhorns\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 9:12 p.m.\n\nLeading Florida by three points with 7:27 to play Wednesday, Texas was outscored 23-7 down the stretch for its second consecutive loss. The Longhorns' five-game winning streak is disappearing in the rearview mirror, with the consensus forecast now setting their at-large chances in the at 63% -- up from 45% earlier in the month but down from 81% a week ago. They still have more Quadrant 1 wins than Texas A&M, but they're also neck and neck with Missouri for 10th among SEC teams in the résumé rankings (mid-40s nationally). Even after losing to Georgia and Florida, two of their final three regular-season contests are against Quad 1 opponents, so their tournament fate still hangs in the balance.\n\nNext game: at Texas A&M (Saturday)\n\nAuburn Tigers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:41 a.m.\n\nThe Tigers stopped their five-game losing streak with Saturday's dramatic victory over Kentucky, but the relief turned out to be only temporary -- they lost again at Oklahoma on Tuesday to cast more doubt on their tournament outlook. They still have a fascinating case: Although all but one of their recent losses came against Quadrant 1 opponents, they have five Quadrant 1 wins against the nation's fourth-most difficult schedule per the BPI and remain top 40 in the national résumé ranking average. But those mounting losses do matter, and teams most similar to Auburn have tended to miss out on an at-large bid more often than not. Whatever happens, they will be an interesting litmus test for what the committee values.\n\nNext game: vs. Mississippi (Saturday)\n\nBIG TEN\n\n9.2 expected bids; 8.2 at-large\n\nLocks (6)\n\nMichigan Wolverines\n\nPurdue Boilermakers\n\nIllinois Fighting Illini\n\nNebraska Cornhuskers\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n\nWisconsin Badgers\n\nShould be in (2)\n\nIowa Hawkeyes\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 11:15 p.m.\n\nAfter a stretch of three losses in four games, Iowa rebounded with a big statement win while hosting Ohio State on Wednesday. Now the Hawkeyes' at-large chances sit around 98%, a strong position to be in. Their résumé still sits in the low-30s nationally -- in addition to being top 25 in our average of predictive ratings -- so their tournament hopes are in good shape. Their remaining schedule won't be easy; after Saturday's trip to Penn State, they close out the regular season against Michigan and Nebraska. But they shouldn't need either of those upsets to round out their résumé.\n\nNext game: at Penn State (Saturday)\n\nUCLA Bruins\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:53 a.m.\n\nAfter consecutive losses on their Michigan tour halted their momentum -- five wins in six games -- the Bruins have bounced back. On Saturday, they beat visiting No. 10 Illinois in overtime on Donovan Dent's coast-to-coast layup, then took down crosstown bubble rival USC by 19 behind Dent's 30 points on Tuesday. They now have three Quadrant 1 wins on the season (two Q1-A) and their résumé ranks borderline top 40 nationally, converging with a predictive rating that has been better than their résumé indicated for most of the year. Even if the Big Ten gets only nine bids, the Bruins would appear to be in line for one of the last of those -- they rank eighth on the conference's résumé list -- and their consensus at-large odds are now 91% in the forecast models.\n\nNext game: at Minnesota (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (3)\n\nIndiana Hoosiers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:10 p.m.\n\nAfter a run of five wins in six games, Indiana has now lost three straight to Illinois, Purdue and Northwestern, shaving the Hoosiers' conditional at-large probability down to the 60% range. Their portfolio can stand up next to other bubble teams -- they rank mid-40s in the national résumé average, no worse than 10th among the Big Ten in what's looking like a nine-bid conference -- and they remain among the top 40 in the predictive metrics. But they just lost their most winnable remaining game to Northwestern and are likely to enter the Big Ten tournament in limbo.\n\nNext game: vs. Michigan State (Sunday)\n\nOhio State Buckeyes\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 11:15 p.m.\n\nWhen we noted that the Buckeyes needed more consistency after alternating wins and losses for so long, they were looking for a winning streak -- not the back-to-back losses they got against Michigan State and Iowa this week. Their at-large chances now sit in the high-50% range, casting doubt on a tournament profile that seemed much stronger not long ago. Ohio State is a better team than its current résumé indicates, ranking inside the top 40 of the predictive ratings. But the Buckeyes have been unable to escape the bubble for very long, ranking in the mid-40s in the résumé rankings -- right on the cutline both nationally and for a projected nine- or 10-bid Big Ten. After the Iowa loss, they are now 1-10 against Quadrant 1 opponents and 0-9 vs. Q1-A specifically. Remaining games against Purdue and Indiana loom large.\n\nNext game: vs. Purdue (Sunday)\n\nUSC Trojans\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 7:53 a.m.\n\nA recent three-game win streak had helped pad USC's bubble case, but losses to Ohio State, Illinois, Oregon and now bubble rival UCLA -- the latter of which saw the Bruins open up a lead near the half and pull away down the stretch -- have sliced the Trojans' at-large chances to just 20%. With the 11th-best résumé ranking in what's trending to be just a nine-bid conference, and a ranking outside the top 50 of the predictive ratings, USC needs strong showings against Nebraska, Washington and UCLA again to make a case as one of the Big Ten's last entries.\n\nNext game: vs. Nebraska (Saturday)\n\nACC\n\n8.1 expected bids; 7.1 at-large\n\nLocks (5)\n\nDuke Blue Devils\n\nVirginia Cavaliers\n\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels\n\nLouisville Cardinals\n\nNC State Wolfpack\n\nShould be in (3)\n\nSMU Mustangs\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:06 a.m.\n\nThe Mustangs improved their projections last week with back-to-back wins over Louisville and Boston College, but Wednesday's loss at California slowed that momentum a bit. They have been neck and neck with Miami (and now Clemson) recently, fighting to be sixth (as opposed to eighth) in what could be an eight-bid ACC. Now SMU's consensus at-large chances are 89% -- narrowly ahead of the Hurricanes and Tigers at 87% each -- though all three teams are well clear of Cal (35%) and Virginia Tech (26%), who stand as its closest bubble rivals within the conference. The Mustangs do have the most challenging schedule of the three, with trips to Stanford and FSU sandwiched around a head-to-head against Miami.\n\nNext game: at Stanford (Saturday)\n\nMiami Hurricanes\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 11:18 p.m.\n\nThe Hurricanes have been on a roll in ACC play lately, adding to their recent résumé-boosting victories over North Carolina, NC State and Virginia Tech with another Quadrant 1 win over Florida State on Tuesday. Their at-large chances are now above those of Clemson and not far from SMU's, though all three teams are bunched closely together in the mid-30s of the national résumé quality ranking -- the trio makes up Nos. 6-8 in the ACC in that regard, with a big gap over the rest of what projects to be non-tournament teams in an eight-bid conference. The BPI has Miami projected to win nearly 24 games now, so the Canes are in good shape.\n\nNext game: vs. Boston College (Saturday)\n\nClemson Tigers\n\nUpdated: Feb. 22, 7:53 a.m.\n\nClemson has gotten ice-cold at the wrong time. The Tigers had been an ACC \"lock\" since Bubble Watch launched on Feb. 3, with a 97% or higher at-large probability in the forecast every day for the past three weeks -- until Saturday. They fell below that threshold with their fourth loss in a row, this time to Quadrant 3 Florida State. They still rank in the low-to-mid 30s nationally on résumé (no worse than eighth in the ACC) and their consensus chances are still around 90% despite the slump. But they have been downgraded as a result, trending lower in the conference's pecking order according to the odds.\n\nNext game: at Virginia (Tuesday)\n\nWork to do (2)\n\nCalifornia Golden Bears\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:26 a.m.\n\nCal's tourney chances remain somewhat distant, but victories over Boston College, Stanford and, most importantly, SMU on Wednesday have the Golden Bears moving in the right direction. They still sit outside the nation's top-50 on the résumé ranking, but they also have five Quadrant 1 wins and face the ACC's easiest remaining schedule. That doesn't leave many more signature-win chances, aside from a Quadrant 1 visit to Wake Forest in the finale. With a consensus at-large probability of 35%, the Bears have to bolster their case further.\n\nNext game: vs. Pittsburgh (Saturday)\n\nVirginia Tech Hokies\n\nUpdated: Feb. 21, 2:26 p.m.\n\nRegrouping from the disappointment of Tuesday's loss to Miami, the Hokies bested Wake Forest by 19 on Saturday to keep their bubble case in play. They do have ammunition in their battle to be possibly the last ACC team called to the brackets, including three Quadrant 1 wins and a résumé rating that is borderline top 50. But their conditional at-large chances are still south of 30%, suggesting they are in serious limbo if they don't knock off North Carolina and/or Virginia as well in the next couple of weeks.\n\nNext game: at North Carolina (Saturday)\n\nBIG 12\n\n7.6 expected bids (6.6 at-large)\n\nLocks (6)\n\nArizona Wildcats\n\nIowa State Cyclones\n\nHouston Cougars\n\nKansas Jayhawks\n\nTexas Tech Red Raiders\n\nBYU Cougars\n\nShould be in (1)\n\nUCF Knights\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 8:05 a.m.\n\nWith so many of the Big 12's expected bids being effective locks -- the six teams listed above each have 99% conditional at-large chances in the model consensus -- the conference's bubble picture really starts with who could be the seventh bid. The Knights had been losing their grip on that spot with three straight losses to Houston, Cincinnati and West Virginia earlier this month, but it's fair to say they've regained their position and then some (now up to 97% at-large odds) with wins over bubble rival TCU, Utah and then a big road upset over BYU on Tuesday night. The victories push their full-season projection back up to near 22 wins and help them close in on the top 30 in the résumé average -- a good place to be, since no other non-lock from the Big 12 is even better than No. 50. With a couple of manageable home games coming up against Baylor and Oklahoma State before a visit to WVU for the season finale, the Knights are back in the driver's seat.\n\nNext game: vs. Baylor (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (2)\n\nTCU Horned Frogs\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 11:36 p.m.\n\nThe Horned Frogs continue to make a run at the Big 12's final at-large nod with their fifth win in six games, beating Arizona State at home Tuesday. Although they sit with a consensus at-large chance in the 40% range, they have four Quadrant 1 wins and have one more chance to add another coming up against Texas Tech on March 3. They have a clear case to be the conference's eighth tournament team, though if seven ends up being the Big 12's magic number, they're in trouble.\n\nNext game: at Kansas State (Saturday)\n\nCincinnati Bearcats\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:17 p.m.\n\nThe Bearcats' late-season bid to inject life into the bubble with their upset of Kansas -- by 16 points at Allen Fieldhouse! -- for their fourth consecutive win was fun while it lasted. Tuesday's loss to Texas Tech threatens to send them back into long shot territory. They are only borderline top 60 in the national résumé average -- the rest of the bubble is generally around No. 45 -- and they are projected to finish the season with 14.4 losses, per the BPI. At this point, their case really relies on two signature wins: over Iowa State at home and at Kansas. The consensus model sets Cincinnati's at-large chances at 12% now.\n\nNext game: vs. Oklahoma State (Saturday)\n\nBIG EAST\n\n3.2 expected bids (2.2 at-large)\n\nLocks (3)\n\nUConn Huskies\n\nSt. John's Red Storm\n\nVillanova Wildcats\n\nShould be in (0)\n\nNone\n\nWork to do (1)\n\nSeton Hall Pirates\n\nUpdated: Feb. 21, 8:27 p.m.\n\nWednesday's 12-point home loss to DePaul put a dent in the Pirates' chances, only mitigated slightly by Saturday's victory over Georgetown. Their at-large chances sit at 13% in the forecast composite, while they rank outside the top 50 nationally in résumé average with only a single Quadrant 1 win. A case will be hard to make if the Big East receives only three bids, which is the current Bracketology expectation, so Seton Hall's last chances to impress the committee would be to upset UConn (Feb. 28 on the road) or St. John's (March 6 at home).\n\nNext game: at UConn (Saturday)\n\nOTHERS\n\nLocks (2)\n\nGonzaga Bulldogs (West Coast Conference)\n\nUtah State Aggies (Mountain West)\n\nShould be in (2)\n\nSaint Mary's Gaels (WCC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nFacing rival Santa Clara in a big Bubble Watch contest Wednesday night, the Gaels outscored the Broncos 44-31 in the second half to pull away for the statement win. They haven't missed the NCAA tournament since 2022, and it's tough to imagine that streak coming to an end now. Saint Mary's sits 27th in the résumé rankings with a consensus 95% at-large probability -- very nearly a \"lock\" -- and after Wednesday, it likely no longer has to worry about how many WCC teams the NCAA can accommodate for the Dance after Gonzaga. It still has just one Quadrant 1 win -- it could add a second vs. Gonzaga when the two meet again on Saturday at Saint Mary's. But the Gaels have to feel like they are in solid shape either way.\n\nNext game: vs. Gonzaga (Saturday)\n\nSaint Louis Billikens (Atlantic 10)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 9:12 p.m.\n\nThe Billikens are a great story in their second season with Josh Schertz at the helm and a cast of five double-figure scorers led by bespectacled big man Robbie Avila, tracking for the best SRS in program history. After they came back to beat bubble rival VCU by 13 points Friday, they turned around and suffered their ugliest loss of the year: by 15 points at Dayton. The positives are that Saint Louis still ranks top 30 nationally in the résumé rankings and even better in the predictive ratings, so it's hard to see this group not making the field as an at-large team if necessary. But there will be lessons to learn from Tuesday's loss.\n\nNext game: vs. Duquesne (Saturday)\n\nWork to do (6)\n\nMiami (Ohio) RedHawks (MAC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 24, 8:26 p.m.\n\nThe MAC hasn't received multiple bids since 1998-99 -- fittingly, the same year Wally Szczerbiak led Miami (Ohio) to the Sweet 16 after knocking off Washington and Utah in the first two rounds. Could history repeat? Miami is the sole remaining unbeaten in Division I and ranks inside the top 40 on résumé as a result. The forecast models don't quite know how to handle the RedHawks, though the committee has never excluded an eligible team with fewer than four losses in a non-pandemic season -- and Miami (Ohio) made the field as an at-large team during an NCAA-ran mock selection exercise last week. It is true that the RedHawks are a mid-80s team in the predictive ratings (Akron actually still ranks higher in the MAC) and had just the 321st-hardest schedule in the nation. But wins are wins, and they held off Eastern Michigan on Tuesday for their 28th. They are now only three away from an undefeated regular season, which ESPN Analytics gives around a 60% chance to happen.\n\nNext game: at Western Michigan (Friday)\n\nSanta Clara Broncos (WCC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nThe Santa Clara and Saint Mary's comparisons will be constant down the stretch as we debate whether the WCC could get three bids -- which has happened only once in the past 13 seasons. The Broncos had beaten SMC in mid-January, but Wednesday's loss in the rematch dropped their consensus at-large chances from 76% to 68% and cast new doubt on whether Santa Clara is tourney-bound. They do own the nation's No. 40 résumé ranking and that previous head-to-head win over Saint Mary's, but their fate appears to hang almost entirely upon whether the selection committee will send that extra WCC at-large team to the Dance.\n\nNext game: vs. Oregon State (Saturday)\n\nSan Diego State Aztecs (MW)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nJust when the Aztecs seemed to be sliding out of the bubble picture with consecutive losses to Grand Canyon and Colorado State, they responded by taking down conference leader Utah State by 17 on Wednesday night. The victory provided a major boost for their consensus at-large chances, which rose from 27% to 49%. After spending most of the season as one of the bubbliest of bubble teams, they are now outside the top 50 nationally in the résumé ranking, but they remain squarely in the mix on the basis of résumé wins. The Mountain West could feasibly send three teams to the tournament -- it hasn't fallen below that threshold in five seasons -- and with a fairly sizable gap in at-large chances between SDSU/New Mexico and the next-best teams (Nevada/Boise State at 5%), both teams could get in regardless. But if the Mountain West gets only two bids, Saturday's tilt in New Mexico could determine who has the edge.\n\nNext game: at New Mexico (Saturday)\n\nNew Mexico Lobos (MW)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 26, 8:30 a.m.\n\nWill anyone separate themselves as the Mountain West's clear No. 2 NCAA contender behind Utah State? Seeking a third straight tournament trip for the first time in more than a decade, New Mexico seemed to regain its edge as the conference's second-most-likely entrant by beating Air Force and Fresno State, as San Diego State fell to both Grand Canyon and Colorado State. But then came Tuesday's loss to Nevada and SDSU's win over the Aggies, pushing the Lobos' consensus at-large chances back down to 35% -- far from ideal. A major blemish on the résumé remains their head-to-head loss at the Aztecs on Jan. 17, which they'll have a chance to avenge Saturday, but there are real questions around which of the MWC bubble squads deserves an at-large nod at this point.\n\nNext game: vs. San Diego State (Saturday)\n\nVCU Rams (A-10)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 21, 9:32 a.m.\n\nVCU hasn't made back-to-back NCAA tournaments since the Will Wade era nearly a decade ago, and the forecast models (which sit in the mid-20% consensus at-large range) remain less than bullish on that streak ending this season. In part, that's because the Rams are 0-5 against Quadrant 1 opponents, including a tough collapse at Saint Louis on Friday that hurt their at-large case. On the positive side, they are right in the middle of bubble territory in overall résumé (mid-40s nationally), they've still won 10 of 11, and their remaining schedule is soft enough for more wins. But it's still totally up in the air if the A-10 will get a second NCAA entry (which has happened in three of the five years since the pandemic), and the Billikens would clearly be first in line for whatever bid(s) the conference does get.\n\nNext game: vs. Fordham (Saturday)\n\nBelmont Bruins (MVC)\n\nUpdated: Feb. 25, 9:24 p.m.\n\nBelmont's case for at-large consideration continues to grow after the Bruins cruised past Evansville for their 13th win in 14 games. They lead the nation in effective FG% and are a top-50 team in our résumé composite. Though they don't have any Quadrant 1 wins, they'll get one more chance to improve on their 5-1 record against Quadrant 2 teams: against Illinois State on March 1.\n\nNext game: at Illinois State (Sunday)\n\nGlossary of terms"

Smith call out Jets coach Aaron Glenn for claiming to have \"playcalling superpowers.\" (2:46)\n\nMad Dog is mad at Aaron Glenn for claiming to have superpowers (2:46)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Jets and Titans agreed to a rare player-for-player trade Thursday, with New York sending pass rusher Jermaine Johnson to Tennessee for defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe trade can't be processed until the start of the league year on March 11.\n\nThe deal marks the latest move in a protracted teardown of a once-formidable defense for the Jets, who also traded away defensive stars Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams -- both former first-round draft picks -- in November.\n\nJohnson will be reunited with Titans coach Robert Saleh, who coached the Jets when they selected Johnson with the 26th overall pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nJohnson, coming off a down year (three sacks), has only one year remaining on his contract and is due to make a guaranteed $13.4 million in 2026, the amount of his fifth-year option.\n\nJohnson generated interest last season before the trade deadline, but the Jets opted to keep him for the remainder of the season. His departure reinforces the belief that the Jets will take an edge player with the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, with Ohio State's Arvell Reese and Texas Tech's David Bailey as the leading candidates.\n\nIn Sweat, the Jets are getting a 6-foot-2, 366-pound interior presence on a team-friendly contract. A second-round pick in 2024, he is signed through 2027 and will count only $1.7 million on the Jets' salary cap.\n\nScheme factored into the trade for both teams. The Jets, who could be using more 3-4 fronts, wanted to add more size up front. The opposite is true for Tennessee, where Saleh's scheme puts a premium on smaller, faster linemen.\n\nSweat, drafted 38th overall in 2024, posted 85 tackles and three sacks in 29 games for the Titans. He suffered an ankle injury in Tennessee's season-opening loss to the Broncos and missed five games last season.\n\nThe Titans are counting on Johnson regaining his form from 2023, when he posted a career-high 7.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. His 2024 season didn't last long. In Week 2, at Tennessee, he tore an Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.\n\nJohnson rehabbed to make it back for the start of the 2025 season, but he didn't have the same burst as before the injury. In 14 games, he finished with only three sacks and six quarterback hits, later admitting his performance wasn't up to his standard. Both he and the team acknowledged that the Achilles injury probably affected his performance.\n\nIn four seasons -- 47 games -- with the Jets, Johnson has 13 sacks and 131 tackles.\n\nESPN's Turron Davenport contributed to this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nThree-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer has agreed to return to the Toronto Blue Jays, a source confirmed to ESPN's Alden Gonzalez on Wednesday.\n\nThe deal is for one year and $3 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nBringing Scherzer back became a bigger need for Toronto with right-hander Bowden Francis undergoing season-ending Tommy John surgery earlier this month and with Shane Bieber delayed with a bout of forearm fatigue.\n\nScherzer, 41, will join newcomers Cody Ponce and Dylan Cease in the rotation. The Blue Jays could choose to ramp him up slowly, prompting him to join the rotation in-season.\n\nAs Scherzer has pitched into his 40s, he has increasingly lost time to injury. He threw a total of 85 regular-season innings for the Blue Jays in 2025 after accumulating only 43⅓ for the Texas Rangers in 2024.\n\nBlue Jays manager John Schneider raved about Scherzer's competitiveness and preparation, and he threw well enough to earn three big starts for Toronto in the postseason -- in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, when he worked through early-inning trouble to stifle the Seattle lineup, and in Games 3 and 7 of the World Series.\n\nFive years after he throws his final pitch, Scherzer will make a speech in Cooperstown, and presumably his election into the Hall of Fame will be unanimous or close to it. Scherzer has finished in the top five of Cy Young Award voting eight times. He has a career 221-117 record with a 3.22 ERA, and his career Adjusted OPS+ of 131 is equivalent to that of Sandy Koufax.\n\nScherzer was a first-round draft pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2006, and he debuted in the big leagues two years later. His delivery at that time drew a lot of scrutiny because of how he snapped his head to the left as he released the ball.\n\nArizona officials discussed the possibility of turning him into a closer, but the Diamondbacks instead shipped him to the Detroit Tigers as part of a three-team trade with the New York Yankees. With the Tigers, Scherzer flourished, going 82-35 over five seasons while establishing himself as one of the game's premier pitchers.\n\nHe signed with the Washington Nationals after the 2014 season, and he and Stephen Strasburg helped them to a championship in 2019. Over the course of his career, he has grossed nearly $370 million in salary, a reflection of his excellence on the mound.\n\nMLB Network was first to report Scherzer's agreement with Toronto.\n\nESPN's Buster Olney contributed to this report."

The team is scheduled to begin its season on March 7.\n\nPorter pleaded guilty in July 2024 in federal court in Brooklyn to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, a felony that carries up to 20 years in prison, though Porter is expected to get between 3-4 years when he is sentenced. He was accused of manipulating his performance and working with gamblers to win prop bets in two games with the Toronto Raptors in the 2023-24 season.\n\nAn NBA investigation also found Porter personally bet on 13 NBA games in 2024 that he didn't play in, a violation of league rules, and won $22,000.\n\nFederal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York have expanded the investigation that started with Porter and went on to indict dozens of others in gambling-related cases including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups.\n\nIn 2024, Porter petitioned a federal judge to be allowed to play for a team in Greece, but the request was denied.\n\nPorter played in 37 games over two NBA seasons."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nCincinnati sued former quarterback Brendan Sorsby in federal court Wednesday, alleging he breached his NIL contract with the Bearcats when he refused to pay a $1 million exit fee after he transferred to Texas Tech.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, seeks $1 million in liquidated damages, which the school said Sorsby was contractually obligated to pay within 30 days of transferring.\n\nIn the complaint, Cincinnati's attorneys said the quarterback's representative \"advised that Sorsby refuses to pay the University anything.\"\n\nSorsby reportedly signed an NIL agreement with the Red Raiders that will pay him between $4 million and $6 million this season.\n\n\"In his lucrative NIL agreement with Cincinnati Athletics, Brendan Sorsby committed to stay and play for two seasons as a proud Bearcat representative,\" the university said in a statement Wednesday. \"He also agreed that if he left the university before that time, he would pay the university a specific amount for the substantial harm that his breach would cause.\n\n\"Cincinnati Athletics intends to enforce that contractual commitment. As stewards of the university's resources, the Athletics Department has a duty to do so. We thank Brendan for his time at Cincinnati and wish him success in the future.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said that Sorsby signed an 18-month NIL contract with the Bearcats that covered the 2025 and 2026 seasons. It was set to expire on Dec. 15, 2026.\n\nThe university claims Sorsby notified the football team on Dec. 1 that he was done playing for the Bearcats and wouldn't compete in their postseason game against Navy in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl on Jan. 2.\n\nSorsby entered the transfer portal on Jan. 2 and almost immediately signed an NIL deal with the Red Raiders.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Sorsby violated the terms of his NIL deal with Cincinnati when his image appeared on a large digital billboard in New York's Times Square announcing his commitment to Texas Tech.\n\nSorsby, a senior from Denton, Texas, was one of the top-rated quarterbacks in the transfer portal. After playing his first two seasons at Indiana, he started at Cincinnati the past two seasons.\n\nIn 2025, he completed 61.6% of his passes for 2,800 yards with 27 touchdowns and five interceptions. He also ran for 580 yards with nine scores, leading the Bearcats to a 7-5 record.\n\nCincinnati claims that although it paid Sorsby a substantial amount last season, \"it did so with the express expectation that it would realize the majority of the benefits during the following season, 2026, after Sorsby's play developed and his brand grew.\"\n\n\"Despite the clear contractual obligation to do so, and despite his ability to pay, Sorsby still has not paid the University the $1 million in liquidated damages he agreed to pay,\" the lawsuit said. \"Sorsby has benefited greatly by the NIL agreement he entered into with the University, along with the University's sustained efforts to promote him and help establish him as a top collegiate quarterback. Now, the University seeks to enforce its rights under that same agreement and to recover the amount Sorsby is contractually obligated to pay.\"\n\nIn a statement later Wednesday night, Sorsby's agent said the QB will fight the lawsuit, calling it \"misguided.\"\n\n\"University of Cincinnati, through its revenue-share structure, paid him $875,800 for a season he fully completed and in that time, he generated millions in value for the program,\" Ron Slavin of Lift Management said. \"Attempting to recover those funds now sends the wrong message to current and future student-athletes and risks damaging the long-term credibility of Cincinnati football. This is further disappointing given that Brendan parted ways with UC in what was a mutually agreeable manner. The money the university seeks to recover from him is nothing more than an unlawful penalty under Ohio law.\"\n\nCincinnati isn't the first college athletics program to sue a former player for liquidated damages after breaking an NIL contract and transferring. In December, Georgia sued former edge rusher Damon Wilson for $390,000 in damages after he transferred to Missouri following the 2024 season.\n\nGeorgia asked a judge to force Wilson into arbitration to settle the dispute. Wilson countersued Georgia in a Missouri court, alleging the Bulldogs had \"weaponized\" a liquidated damages clause in an unenforceable way to \"punish Wilson for entering the portal.\"\n\nWilson transferred to Miami in January after playing one season for the Tigers.\n\nDuke officials sued former quarterback Darian Mensah on Jan. 20 in an attempt to prevent him from transferring to Miami and to try to enforce the multiyear NIL contract he signed with the Blue Devils.\n\nThe sides reached an undisclosed settlement on Jan. 27, allowing Mensah to join the Hurricanes."

            "content": "Olympic gold medal winner Hilary Knight said Wednesday that a widely circulated comment from President Donald Trump about the United States women's team was a \"distasteful joke\" and that she's more focused on celebrating the women's accomplishments at the Milan Games.\n\nDuring the American men's team's locker room celebration in Milan, Trump extended an invitation to the players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address. \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\"\n\nAppearing on \"SportsCenter\" on Wednesday, Knight said, \"I thought it was sort of a distasteful joke, and unfortunately that is overshadowing a lot of the success, the success of just women at the Olympics carrying for Team USA and having amazing gold medal feats.\n\n\"We're just focusing on celebrating the women in our room, the extraordinary efforts, and continue to celebrate three gold medals in program history as well as the double gold for both men's and women's at the same time. And really not detract from that with a distasteful joke.\"\n\nKnight later said that she was looking forward to \"celebrating all great things that have come out of the Olympics and feeling the love and support and getting back in our respective communities and sharing this journey with them. And that's what this is all about.\"\n\nSeveral players on the men's team appeared to laugh at Trump's comment, a reaction that drew criticism when the video went viral. Jack Hughes, who scored the men's gold medal game winner, and his brother Quinn were asked about the situation Tuesday and focused on the team's relationship with the women's squad.\n\n\"Our relationship with them, over the course of being in the Olympic Village, I think we are so tight with their group,\" Hughes said in an interview he and Quinn did on \"Good Morning America.\" \"After we won the gold medal, we were in the cafeteria at 3:30 a.m. in the morning with them. We go from there, pack our bags and we're on the bus.\n\n\"People are so negative about things. I think everyone in that locker room knows how much we support them, how proud we are of them. The same way we feel about them, they feel about us.\"\n\nKnight echoed that the teams get along well.\n\n\"I think there's a genuine level of support there and respect,\" she said. \"I think that's being overshadowed by a quick lapse. I think the guys were in a tough spot, so I think it's a shame this storyline and narrative has kind of blown up and overshadowing that connection and genuine interest in one another and cheering each other on.\"\n\nGoaltender Jeremy Swayman told reporters in Boston after returning to practice with the Bruins that the men \"should have reacted differently\" to Trump's remarks.\n\n\"To share that gold medal with them is something that we're forever grateful for,\" Swayman said. \"And now that we're home we get to share that together forever and see the incredible support we have from the USA and share this incredible gold medal.\"\n\nHughes said the moment did not reflect the views of the men's team.\n\n\"You're in the moment and the president calls. We're blaring the music. It is what it is,\" Hughes said Wednesday night after his first game back with the New Jersey Devils. \"We have so much respect for the women's team and they have so much respect for us. We are all just proud Americans.\"\n\nWhile the men's team did attend the State of the Union address, the women's team, which won gold for the third time since the Olympics added the women's hockey competition in 1998, declined an invitation, citing logistics and scheduling concerns.\n\n\"We are sincerely grateful for the invitation extended to our gold medal-winning U.S. Women's Hockey Team and deeply appreciate the recognition of their extraordinary achievement,\" the U.S. women's team said in a statement released Monday. \"Due to the timing and previously scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games, the athletes are unable to participate. They were honored to be included and are grateful for the acknowledgment.\"\n\nKnight scored the tying goal against Canada on a redirection in the final two minutes. Megan Keller scored in overtime to lift the Americans to the 2-1 victory.\n\nThis was the final Olympic game for Knight, 36, who with her second gold medal became the most decorated player in U.S. women's hockey history. She announced in May that these Games -- her fifth -- would be her last.\n\nShe ends first among American skaters -- men or women -- in Olympic goals (15) and points (33) in a career.\n\nKnight told \"SportsCenter\" that this whole situation is a \"really good learning point, to really focus on how we talk about women, not only in sport but in industry. Women aren't less than, and their achievements shouldn't be overshadowed by anything else other than how great they are.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Business News of Thursday, 26 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nA new study conducted by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at the University of Ghana has called for a hybrid waste management framework that combines decentralised local systems with large-scale private sector participation to improve efficiency, attract capital, introduce technology, and unlock long-term value in Ghana’s sanitation sector.\n\n\n\nThe report, titled “An Economic Analysis of the Benefits of Adequate Investment in Waste Management and Sanitation in Ghana,” argues that while empowering Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) remains critical, structural transformation of the sector requires the participation of large industry players capable of injecting substantial capital and technical expertise beyond the capacity of most local authorities.\n\n\n\nPresenting the findings in Accra on Thursday, February 26, 2026, Lead Researcher and Economist at the University of Ghana, Professor Peter Quartey, said decentralisation provides institutional proximity and accountability but does not necessarily deliver the scale required for infrastructure-intensive investments.\n\n\n\n“Our assemblies are closest to the problem. They understand the local dynamics of waste generation and collection,” Professor Quartey noted. “However, building modern material recovery facilities, large composting plants, or waste-to-energy installations requires financial depth and engineering capacity that most MMDAs simply do not possess. A strategic partnership model is therefore essential.”\n\n\n\nThe study highlights a significant mismatch between sector needs and current expenditure. Ghana’s 261 MMDAs collectively spend about GHS 180 million annually on waste management and sanitation—an amount the report describes as inadequate relative to the scale of the problem and the economic opportunities within the waste value chain.\n\n\n\nISSER estimates that inadequate sanitation costs Ghana’s economy more than GHS 6.2 billion annually through healthcare expenses and productivity losses. Researchers argue that incremental improvements within existing budget limits will not deliver systemic change.\n\n\n\nThe report proposes a two-tier financing model. At the metropolitan level, where waste volumes create economies of scale, public-private partnerships (PPPs) could attract investment into high-capacity recycling facilities, engineered landfills, and waste-to-energy plants.\n\n\n\nAt the local level, targeted public investment should prioritise waste collection systems, safe disposal sites, drainage rehabilitation, and the elimination of open dumping.\n\n\n\nData presented in the study revealed disparities across jurisdictions. Metropolitan assemblies such as Accra and Tema spend significantly more per capita on waste management than smaller municipal and district assemblies.\n\n\n\nHowever, smaller assemblies often face higher vulnerability to sanitation-related diseases due to limited infrastructure, weak drainage systems, and rapid peri-urban expansion.\n\n\n\nCo-author Dr Kwame Adjei-Mantey cautioned that uniform policy approaches could deepen inequality.\n\n\n\n“Large cities can attract private operators because they offer scale and predictable revenue streams,” he said. “Smaller districts require deliberate fiscal support to build foundational systems. Without that balance, investment will concentrate in commercially attractive areas while high-burden communities remain underserved.”\n\n\n\nThe report identifies fast-growing municipal assemblies as critical intervention points, noting that they shoulder significant waste-related expenditure while lacking the scale to finance advanced processing infrastructure independently.\n\n\n\nResearchers also highlighted the technical potential for Ghana’s municipal solid waste to generate up to 1,484 megawatts of electricity under an optimised waste-to-energy framework.\n\n\n\nProfessor Ebo Turkson, a member of the research team, said such projects require industrial-scale financing and operational expertise that decentralised local systems alone cannot provide.\n\n\n\n“Waste-to-energy plants, advanced sorting facilities, and integrated composting systems are capital-intensive undertakings,” he noted. “Private firms with sector experience can deliver operational efficiency and technological innovation, provided regulatory clarity and bankable project structures are in place.”\n\n\n\nHowever, the study cautions that private participation must operate within strong regulatory and contractual frameworks to protect public interest and environmental standards.\n\n\n\nWhile endorsing private sector involvement, the report emphasises that MMDAs must evolve into effective regulators and contract managers by strengthening procurement systems, performance monitoring, data collection, and enforcement mechanisms.\n\n\n\nDr Ralph Armah stressed that decentralisation should not mean reduced oversight.\n\n\n\n“Local assemblies must become intelligent clients capable of negotiating balanced agreements and ensuring service quality,” he said. “Institutional strengthening is as important as capital mobilisation.”\n\n\n\nThe report also calls for structured integration of informal waste collectors into formal systems, arguing that inclusive policies could improve efficiency while enhancing occupational safety, income stability, and training opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe study concludes that Ghana requires a coordinated national waste management strategy that clearly defines responsibilities among central government, MMDAs, and private sector operators. Policy predictability, transparent tariff systems, and enforceable environmental standards were identified as essential for sustainable investment.\n\n\n\nProfessor Quartey described the current moment as a strategic inflection point.\n\n\n\n“Decentralisation remains essential, but it cannot succeed without capital and technology injections from strategic private sector players,” he said. “If empowered local governance aligns with credible private sector participation, Ghana can transform waste from a fiscal burden into a productive economic sector.”"

We do not condone violence or any behaviour that undermines the safety, dignity, and well-being of others.”\n\n\n\nManagement offered what it described as an “unqualified apology” to key stakeholders, including the Ghana Education Service headquarters, the Central Regional Directorate of Education, the Agona West Municipal Directorate of Education, the management and students of Obrachire Senior High School, the affected student, parents, old students and the general public.\n\n\n\nThe school also disclosed that it is cooperating with the police as investigations continue.\n\n\n\n“Management is collaborating fully with the appropriate security and law enforcement agencies to ensure that due process is followed, as the students involved are currently with the law enforcement agencies. Appropriate sanctions will be applied based on the outcome of ongoing investigations,” the statement said.\n\n\n\nBeyond disciplinary action, SWEBUS pledged to strengthen internal systems to prevent similar incidents.\n\n“Swedru School of Business remains committed to strengthening guidance, counseling, and disciplinary measures to prevent any recurrence of such incidents. We will continue to intensify character education and promote a culture of respect, tolerance, and peaceful coexistence among our students and other students,” it stated.\n\n\n\nThe school appealed for calm, urging the public to allow authorities to complete their work while it remains “dedicated to maintaining a safe and disciplined environment that fosters learning and mutual respect.”\n\n\n\nSO/VPO\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "General News of Thursday, 26 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nDean of Students at the School of Languages, University of Ghana, Prof Josephine Dzahene-Quarshie, has called for urgent and practical steps to strengthen the use of Ghanaian languages in education, stressing that policy alone is not enough.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the International Mother Language Day symposium held on Wednesday, February 25, 2026, Dzahene-Quarshie stated that Ghana has made significant progress in promoting local languages over the past decade.\n\n\n\n“If we compare today to five or ten years ago, we have done a lot of good for our Ghanaian languages. They are taught in primary education, and in most of our traditional universities, courses are run in Ghanaian languages,” she stated.\n\n\n\nShe credited the media, particularly the growth of FM radio stations, for helping to promote indigenous languages across the country.\n\n\n\n“With the coming of more FM stations, our local languages are used more often nationwide. They are really contributing to the consolidation and development of our languages,” she noted.\n\n\n\nShe also stressed that government especially the ministry of education must do more to ensure effective implementation of language policies.\n\n\n\n“The policies are there and they are good, but when it comes to implementation, we have shortfalls. We must address those shortfalls,” she said.\n\n\n\nShe referenced the policy introduced in 2025, requiring local languages to be used as the medium of instruction from kindergarten to primary three.\n\n\n\nHowever, she pointed out a major gap in learning materials.\n\n\n\nProfessor Wiafe urges stakeholders to leverage AI to safeguard local dialects\n\n\n\n“There are textbooks for learning Twi or Ga as subjects but there is no science textbook written in Akan or Ga or any other Ghanaian language. That is the direction we must go. We should document our languages across various subject areas,” she explained.\n\n\n\nProf Dzahene-Quarshie further proposed the establishment of vocabulary expansion bodies to help develop new terms in local languages, especially for science and technology terminologies.\n\n\n\n“The fact that we do not currently have certain vocabularies should not deter us. We need agencies that can coin new words for us to use in order to sustain and develop our languages,” she said.\n\n\n\nAddressing parents, she urged a change in mindset regarding English and education.\n\n\n\n“Speaking English is not education. Acquiring knowledge and being able to communicate what one knows — that is education,” she stressed.\n\n\n\nShe added that research shows children are capable of learning multiple languages with ease.\n\n\n\n“Children can pick up as many as six languages if they are in the right environment, there is nothing wrong with a child learning to speak their mother tongue first. In fact, it gives them a firm foundation for learning other languages,” she stated.\n\n\n\nDzahene-Quarshie encouraged parents to take pride in speaking their native languages at home.\n\n\n\n“English is not our language and we have limited environments where it is spoken. If a child speaks their local language well, it strengthens their ability to learn other languages. We must continue to educate our parents so they understand this and feel proud to speak their mother tongues with their children,” she said.\n\n\n\nSO/VPO\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "Zia Choudhury is UN Resident Coordinator for Ghana\n\nThe United Nations Resident Coordinator for Ghana and an advocate for multilingual education, Zia Choudhury, has urged the youth of Ghana to take the lead in protecting and promoting mother tongues, describing language as central to identity, culture and national development.\n\nSpeaking at the International Mother Language Day at the University of Ghana on Wednesday February 25, 2026, he explained why the date February 21 holds deep personal and historical significance.\n\n\n\n“February 21 is not just a date on the calendar for us. It is a day that reminds tens of millions of Bangladeshis of the sacrifices made to defend our mother tongue,” he stated.\n\n\n\nReflecting on the meaning of a mother tongue, Choudury noted that it goes beyond the first language learned at home.\n\n\n\n“It is the sweet language our mothers used to tell us stories, sing songs, or whisper messages of love to us,” he said.\n\n\n\n“Those first words shaped our minds, our culture and our very souls,” he added.\n\n\n\nChoudhury recounted how in 1948, authorities in the then Pakistan declared ‘Urdu’ the sole national language, effectively downgrading ‘Bangla’, a language spoken by millions in what is now Bangladesh.\n\n“Imagine your mother tongue being ridiculed and pushed aside in favour of a language from a distant land,” he said.\n\n\n\nProfessor Wiafe urges stakeholders to leverage AI to safeguard local dialects\n\n\n\n“History shows us that language has often been used as a tool of power and control,” he added.\n\n\n\nThat decision sparked widespread resistance, culminating in the fatal shooting of student protesters on February 21, 1952.\n\n\n\n“Young people demanding recognition of their mother tongue were killed by police,” he recounted.\n\n\n\n“Many brave men and women risked imprisonment and even death simply to say, ‘I speak Bangla,” he added.\n\nThe movement eventually contributed to Bangladesh’s independence, and February 21 became a National Day of Mourning.\n\n\n\nIn the 1990s, however, Bangladesh proposed to the United Nations that the date be recognised globally to celebrate linguistic diversity.\n\n\n\n“In 2000, UN member states unanimously agreed, and it became International Mother Language Day,” he said.\n\n\n\nHighlighting this year’s theme, “Youth Voices on Multilingual Education,” he stressed the importance of inclusive learning.\n\n\n\n“Forty percent of learners worldwide still do not receive education in a language they understand best,” he noted, citing UNESCO data.\n\n\n\n“These language barriers deepen inequality, particularly for rural and marginalised children,” he added.\n\nZia Choudhury commended Ghana for championing the use of mother-tongue as mode of instruction from kindergarten to primary three, describing it as a step in the right direction.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, attention was drawn to the digital era, where emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence present both risks and opportunities.\n\n\n\n“AI can be a threat, but we can also use it to our huge advantage. The potential is massive if we use it wisely,” he stated.\n\n\n\nChoudhury urged greater engagement with young people to drive decisions that directly impacts them.\n\n\n\n“Let’s support the young people, listen to them, and learn from their skills and experiences. Languages build inclusive societies, strengthen cooperation and preserve our shared cultural heritage,” he said.\n\n\n\nSO/VPO\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Recent comments by United States and Israeli officials supporting the concept of a “Greater Israel” have raised alarm bells across the region and shed light on a vision once only rarely publicly spoken about.\n\nAn interview aired last week by the American right-wing podcaster Tucker Carlson with US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee started the current furore. Carlson, an influential figure who has been vocally critical of Israel over the past year, repeatedly asked Huckabee whether he supported Israel controlling all the land between the Nile River in Egypt and the Euphrates River in Iraq.\n\nHuckabee, a Christian Zionist, would not disavow the belief that the Bible promised that land to Israel – even though it now encompasses all or part of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria.\n\n“It would be fine if they took it all,” Huckabee said, leading to anger from those countries and others in the region, many of which are close US allies.\n\nThen, speaking on Monday, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said that he would support “anything that will allow the Jews a large, broad, strong land and a safe haven for us”.\n\n“Zionism is based on the Bible. Our mandate over the land of Israel is biblical, [and] the biblical borders of the land of Israel are clear … Therefore, the borders are the borders of the Bible,” the apparently secular Israeli politician said.\n\nSo what is Greater Israel exactly? And is it really an ultimate goal for some Israeli politicians?\n\nDefining Greater Israel\n\nThe most expansionist claim for a Greater Israel is based on a biblical verse (Genesis 15:18-21), which narrates God making a covenant with Abraham that promises his descendants the land between the Nile and the Euphrates.\n\n\n\nThat would include the Jewish people, with the tribes of Israel believed to be descended through Abraham’s son, Isaac. But it would also include the children of another of Abraham’s sons, Ishmael (Ismail), regarded as the forefather of the Arabs.\n\nOther definitions based on different biblical verses are narrower in their territorial scope and specify that the land of Israel would be promised to the tribes of Israel descended from Isaac.\n\nHow has Israel worked to achieve expansion?\n\nThe current state of Israel emerged from the British Mandate for Palestine in 1948. The mandate, created by the League of Nations in the wake of World War I and the occupation of Palestine by the British, geographically limited Israel upon its creation.\n\nThe 1948 war that followed the end of the mandate led to Israel taking control of all of Mandatory Palestine, with the exception of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nBut Israel soon expanded by force – in 1967 it defeated Arab forces and took control of the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula, and Syria’s occupied Golan Heights. Israel continues to occupy all of those regions, with the exception of the Sinai, which it returned to Egypt in 1982.\n\nSince then, Israel has ignored international law and continued occupying Palestinian and Syrian land, and has shown little respect for its neighbours’ sovereignty, occupying more land in Syria, as well as in Lebanon.\n\nHow popular is the idea of Greater Israel?\n\nThis needs to be broken down into two separate concepts – the expansion of Israel into the territory that immediately borders it, and the most extreme definition of Greater Israel: between the Nile and the Euphrates.\n\nIn terms of expansion into its immediate surroundings, Israeli Jews by and large support the annexation of East Jerusalem, which is occupied Palestinian territory, and the Golan Heights.\n\nThe Israeli government continues to move towards the de facto annexation of the occupied West Bank. Israeli politicians vary in how open they are in their support for the formal annexation of the West Bank, but most mainstream Israeli politicians are supportive of the illegal Israeli settlements in the territory.\n\nAn expansion of Israeli settlements into Gaza is not as popular, but is supported by far-right Israeli parties.\n\nA Greater Israel, including parts of Jordan, or the most irredentist definition between the Euphrates and the Nile, is more controversial. Pre-1948, many Zionists sought not just Palestine but also Jordan for their future state – one of the most important Zionist armed groups at the time, the Irgun, even included the map of both Palestine and Jordan in its emblem.\n\n\n\nBut after the foundation of Israel this took a back seat, and open calls for a vastly expanded Israel were largely restricted to the fringes. But those fringes – far-right figures like Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – are now in government, reflecting a wider radicalisation within Israeli society itself.\n\nThat means the Israeli ‘mainstream’, politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and centrists like Lapid, are either more open in their support for some form of Greater Israel beyond the West Bank, or less willing to publicly oppose it.\n\nHow threatened do regional countries feel?\n\nRegional states have said that the annexation of the West Bank would be a red line, but have been unable to reverse Israel’s occupation.\n\nHints at a wider expansion have led to an angry reaction from Arab countries. This goes further back than Huckabee’s recent comments. For example, Jordan condemned Smotrich – Israel’s finance minister – when he gave a speech in 2023 at a podium that displayed a map that showed Jordan as part of Israel.\n\nAnd Huckabee’s support for Greater Israel was roundly condemned by more than a dozen states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkiye.\n\nFor Arab and Muslim states, the anger at the comments partially emanates from the sense of a lack of respect towards the sovereignty of regional states by a US official. But it also highlights fears that the balance of power in the region is weighted towards an Israel that is increasingly willing to attack across the Middle East, and has little interest in peace.\n\nEven if the takeover of the land between the Nile and the Euphrates is not feasible, a region where Israel is the primary hegemon will likely lead to more attacks, more wars, and, if Israel determines it necessary, more occupation of land."

            "content": "The World Economic Forum boss, a former Norwegian foreign minister, had dinners and exchanged messages with Epstein.\n\nBorge Brende has resigned from his roles as the president and CEO of the World Economic Forum (WEF), following revelations of his links with the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBrende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who became president of the WEF in 2017, announced his departure on Thursday, joining the ranks of prominent figures to have left their jobs or faced criminal investigations after their contacts with Epstein were revealed in files released by the US Department of Justice last month.\n\n“After careful consideration, I have decided to step down as President and CEO of the World Economic Forum. My time here, spanning 8-1/2 years, has been profoundly rewarding,” Brende said in a statement, which made no mention of Epstein.\n\n“I am grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions.”\n\nBrende’s departure came several weeks after the WEF, organiser of the annual Davos summit,⁠ launched an independent investigation into his relationship with Epstein, following revelations in the files that the Norwegian had three business dinners with the financier and had also communicated with him via email and text message.\n\nEpstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008, spending about a year in prison before his release.\n\nHis contacts with a network of wealthy and influential figures continued in the wake of his conviction until an investigation into the wealthy financier was reopened in 2019. Epstein died by suicide in prison that year while facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.\n\nDinners, emails\n\nBrende said in a statement earlier this month that during a visit to New York in 2018, he received an invitation from former Norwegian politician Terje Rod-Larsen to join him for dinner with several other leaders, plus “someone who was presented to me as an American investor, Jeffrey Epstein”.\n\n\n\n“The following year, I attended two similar dinners with Epstein, alongside other diplomats and business leaders. These dinners, and a few emails and SMS messages, were the extent of my interactions with him,” he said.\n\n“I was completely unaware of Epstein’s past and criminal activities.”\n\nHe said that had he known about Epstein’s background, he would have declined any contact with the convicted sex offender, adding that he regretted not having conducted a more thorough investigation into his past.\n\nInvestigation concluded\n\nIn a separate statement, Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink, co-chairs of the WEF, said the independent review ⁠conducted by outside counsel into Brende’s ties with Epstein had concluded.\n\nThe findings stated there were no additional concerns beyond what had been previously disclosed, it ⁠added.\n\nThe co-chairs said the WEF’s Alois Zwinggi will serve ⁠as interim president and CEO, and that the forum’s board of trustees would oversee the leadership transition, including a plan to identify a permanent replacement.\n\nArrests and resignations\n\nEpstein had ties to a long list of business and political leaders, whose links to the disgraced figure have now come under close scrutiny, resulting in arrests and resignations.\n\nIn Norway, Thorbjorn Jagland, former prime minister and former secretary-general of the Council of Europe, has been charged with “aggravated corruption” amid an investigation into his connections to Epstein, while Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul, both diplomats, have also been charged.\n\nCrown Princess Mette-Marit, the wife of Crown Prince Haakon, heir to Norway’s throne, has also come under heavy scrutiny following the revelation of her close friendship with Epstein, issuing a public apology for her long association with him.\n\nIn the UK, prominent figures including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor – formerly Prince Andrew – and Peter Mandelson, the former diplomat, minister, and adviser to multiple Labour Party prime ministers, have been arrested over alleged crimes linked to their relationships with Epstein.\n\nIn France, financial crimes prosecutors have opened an investigation into former Culture Minister Jack Lang, while in Slovakia, Miroslav Lajcak, former president of the UN General Assembly, resigned as security adviser to the country’s prime minister amid growing criticism over his correspondence with Epstein, uncovered in the files.\n\nA growing number of prominent business and academic figures have also left their posts after their ties to Epstein were revealed."

            "content": "The international community’s lack of action in taking punitive action against Israel over its pervasive breaches of international law in the occupied West Bank has contributed to making the annexation of Palestinian territory an “irreversible” reality, Amnesty International has said.\n\nIn a statement released on Thursday, the human rights group said impunity granted to Israel by global powers has further emboldened the far-right government of Benjamin Netanyahu to “turbocharge” efforts to dispossess Palestinians across the West Bank.\n\n“The unconditional support of the USA government, combined with the pervasive lack of international accountability for Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza, decades of crimes under international law linked to its unlawful occupation and its system of apartheid, has further emboldened Israel to escalate its illegal actions,” Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns said.\n\nThe formalization of land grabs, the expansion of illegal settlements and state-backed settler violence in the territory “are a direct indictment of the international community’s catastrophic failure to take decisive action,” Guevara-Rosas said.\n\nCountries, she added, have refused to use the tools at their disposal, such as suspension of the European Union-Israel Association Agreement, to deter Israel from its action.\n\nThe West Bank has been under Israeli occupation since the 1967 war. Since then, the contiguity of the Palestinian territory has been increasingly fragmented by the construction of hundreds of Israeli housing units, entrenching Israeli occupation. These settlements are illegal under international law.\n\n\n\nFollowing Israel’s genocidal war, which started following the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel in October 2023, the number of settlements has sharply expanded, and the hundreds of makeshift outposts have multiplied. The population of Jewish Israelis in these areas has now soared past half a million people.\n\nAt the same time, Israeli army raids, attacks, house demolitions and arrests in the occupied territory are at unprecedented levels, while settlers attack and kill Palestinians and rampage through their property with impunity, backed by the military and the state.\n\nAt least 1,094 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops and settlers in the West Bank since October 2023, according to the latest United Nations figures.\n\nLast week, the UN Human Rights Council warned in a new report (PDF) that Israeli policies in the West Bank – including “the systematic unlawful use of force” by the Israeli army and unlawful demolitions of Palestinian homes – aim to uproot Palestinian communities.\n\nThe UN report raised concerns of “ethnic cleansing” by Israeli authorities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, amid increased attacks and forcible transfers that “appear to aim at a permanent displacement” of Palestinians.\n\nAmnesty International outlined a list of actions taken by the Israeli government since December:\n\nOn December 10, 2025, the Israel Land Authority published a tender for 3,401 housing units in the E1 area, east of Jerusalem, to expand the illegal settlement of Ma’ale Adumim and create a continuum with occupied East Jerusalem. This would split the West Bank into two.\n\nOn December 11, 2025, Israel’s security cabinet approved plans to establish 19 new settlements, bringing the total number approved by the current coalition government to 68 in just three years and the total number of official settlements to about 210.\n\nOn January 5, 2026, the Israeli civil administration designated 694 dunams of land belonging to the Palestinian towns of Deir Istiya, Biddya and Kafr Thulth in the northern West Bank as “state land”.\n\nOn February 8, 2026, Israel’s security cabinet approved a series of sweeping measures to expand its powers across the occupied West Bank, including easing the sale of Palestinian land to Israeli settlers and expanding the powers of Israeli authorities in areas under Palestinian control.\n\nOn February 15, 2026, the Israeli cabinet issued a decision that amounts to annexation under Israeli law. It allocated more than 244 million Israeli shekels ($78m) for the establishment of a government mechanism to facilitate land registration in Area C, transferring the powers of land registration from the civil administration to Israel’s Ministry of Justice.\n\n\n\nThese actions took place despite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling (PDF) in 2024 that the “Israeli occupation is illegal and should end its unlawful presence … as rapidly as possible … including removing settlements and forcing settlers out.” And last year, the UN General Assembly issued a resolution setting September 2025 as the deadline to end Israel’s occupation.\n\n“Yet instead of complying, Israel has simply invented new ways to violate international law, further entrenching its unlawful occupation and apartheid – while the international community continues, at best, to pay lip service to Palestinians’ rights and taken no effective action,” Guevara-Rosas said."

            "content": "The two nations claim to be sanctuaries for all Hindus and Jews, but security within each remains shaped by persistent hierarchies and exclusion.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu and Narendra Modi shared a conspicuously warm embrace as the Indian prime minister stepped off Air India One at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport on Wednesday, a moment that captured the political intimacy between the two leaders. Over the course of his two-day visit, the two sides are expected to sign several agreements, further consolidating an already deepening partnership between Israel and India.\n\nModi has long been a driving force behind this closeness. His 2017 trip marked the first visit to Israel by an Indian prime minister and signalled a decisive shift in bilateral relations. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, he called this trip a “historic visit”, later receiving a standing ovation at a reception at the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, where Netanyahu declared, “This is true friendship, between two leaders, between two countries, and between two ancient nations.”\n\nOf course, this friendship does not just hinge on the deals and agreements the two leaders are set to sign. While welcoming Modi on the tarmac at Ben Gurion airport, Sara Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister’s wife, wore orange/saffron, the colour of Hindutva. The Israeli prime minister also pointed out that her outfit matched the orange pocket square Modi was wearing.\n\nThe prominence of Hindutva’s signature colour was difficult to ignore and suggested a clear ease with, and affirmation of, the ideological framework underpinning Modi’s politics. The ideological partnership between Netanyahu and Modi rests on a belief that both leaders stand as a bulwark against what they consider an existential civilisational struggle against Islam and Islamism. Bibi’s Israel is meant to serve as a haven for all Jews, while Modi’s India is meant to keep Hindus safe.\n\n\n\nBut it is worth asking, whose safety is really guaranteed in Israel and India?\n\nThe genocide in Gaza and the ongoing settler violence and annexation of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank are only the latest reminders that Palestinians cannot expect to be safe in the Holy Land. Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up about 19 percent of the population, face various forms of institutionalised discrimination and are, in fact, as Amnesty International put it, “lesser citizens” of Israel.\n\nBut not all Jewish citizens of Israel are “safe” either. Racial discrimination against Mizrahi Jews has been a matter of official policy, written into the very foundations of the state of Israel.\n\nA distinct antagonism towards Mizrahi Jews’ Middle East roots was evident when Ze’ev Jabotinsky, the founder of Revisionist Zionism and the Zionist paramilitary group Irgun, said, “We Jews have nothing in common with what is called the Orient, thank God. To the extent that our uneducated masses [i.e. Middle Eastern Jews] have ancient spiritual traditions and laws that call the Orient, they must be weaned away from them, and this is in fact what we are doing in every decent school, what life itself is doing with great success. We are going in Palestine, first for our national convenience, to sweep out thoroughly all traces of the Oriental soul.”\n\nDeclassified state documents show that thousands of babies from Arab Jewish families arriving in Israel after its creation were stolen by hospitals and clinics and handed over “to wealthy Jewish families in Israel and abroad”. Yemeni families suffered the “largest proportion of disappearances”. It is estimated that “one in eight children [from Yemeni families] under the age of four” had gone missing by the time the State of Israel turned six.\n\nRacial discrimination is not a matter of the past, and this white supremacy is ever more evident in the structural and everyday racism faced by Ethiopian Jews. Though accounting for only 2 percent of the population, more than half of Ethiopian Jewish citizens live below the poverty line. Their neighbourhoods are chronically under-resourced, and Ethiopian Jewish children and youth face substance abuse, violence, high school dropout rates, as well as an alarming increase in cases of depression and suicide.\n\nReflecting this experience, one participant in a study published by the Association for Jewish Studies said, “No matter what we do, this is what we get. ‘These Ethiopians, these barbarians, they infiltrate Israel.’ Take police racism, for instance, they treat us like invaders, criminals, even though this is our home. And the strangest thing is, who knows the feeling of exclusion better than the Jewish people? We weren’t accepted in Europe because we were Jewish, and now you don’t accept us because we’re Black?! You were discriminated and now you discriminate us. You’re not accepting yourself! We are PART of you, can’t you SEE?”.\n\n\n\nThese realities show that Israel is not a place of safety for all Jews.\n\nIndia is no different. Structural and everyday discrimination faced by the country’s minority Muslim population is well documented across legal, political and social spheres. Critics and oppositional voices remain under threat. But are all Hindus safe under a Hindu nationalist leadership?\n\nCaste-based discrimination, while not an invention of this government, remains a central feature of Indian society and has intensified under Modi’s rule.\n\nIn January, the University Grants Commission (UGC) introduced the Promotion of Equity in Higher Education Institutions Regulations. The move followed Supreme Court pressure to address harassment and discrimination faced by Dalit students. The regulations “make heads of institutions directly responsible for preventing and responding to discrimination on the basis of caste, religion, gender or disability by students, teachers or non-teaching staff”. The measures faced immediate backlash, and the court has since “stayed the new regulations”.\n\nBehind these regulations lies a tragic record of suicides among Dalit students. This includes the highly publicised case of Dalit PhD candidate Rohith Vemula at the University of Hyderabad in 2016. Vemula was active on campus, raising the issue of caste discrimination, prompting complaints from the student wing of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The matter reached Smriti Irani, the then-human resource development minister in the Modi government, who asked university leadership to investigate. Vemula’s fellowship was suspended, and he was forced to vacate his dormitory.\n\nHe died by suicide on January 16, 2016, writing in his suicide note that his “birth was his fatal accident”.\n\nA 2021 Pew study reveals that a majority of Indians “do not see widespread discrimination against Scheduled Castes and Tribes”. Yet UGC data from 2025 shows caste-related complaints have risen sharply. Employment patterns also reproduce caste hierarchies, with 77 percent of sewer and septic workers coming from Dalit communities. Research suggests that caste hierarchies are increasingly reproduced in artificial intelligence systems. The anti-affirmative action activism of the Hindu nationalist diaspora also demonstrates that caste hierarchies extend beyond national boundaries.\n\nWhat is the point of dredging up this record of exclusion, discrimination and hierarchy in light of Modi’s bromance with Netanyahu? It certainly does not mean that if racism in Israeli society did not exist, or if casteism were eliminated in India, their ideologies and political actions would be any more acceptable. Rather, it is to highlight the expansive and multifaceted nature of the hierarchies and structures of exclusion propagated by the two leaders. The main targets of their discourse and policies are Palestinians across Palestine and Israel, and Muslims in India. Yet the proponents of their politics are equally keen to weaponise this discourse and brand of statecraft to target those who do not fit their hegemonic conception of life and politics.\n\n\n\nThat is to say, truly, no one is safe in Israel and India.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance."

            "content": "During his Knesset speech in Jerusalem, Modi mentioned multilateral projects on which India and Israel collaborate.\n\nModi, Netanyahu praise each other in address to Israeli Knesset\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has delved into the history of the relationship between India and Israel, which has improved exponentially since 2014 when he came to power, as he addressed the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, in Jerusalem.\n\nDuring the speech on Wednesday, the first day of his two-day visit to Israel, Modi also urged closer cooperation on various projects, including the proposed India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the I2U2.\n\nWe unpack what the IMEC and I2U2 are and why Modi’s address is significant.\n\nWhat did Modi say during his Knesset address?\n\nModi was greeted with a standing ovation in the Knesset. Parliamentarians chanted his name as the Indian prime minister replied with a namaste by joining his palms.\n\nThe Indian prime minister opened his speech by saying the “world was shattered by the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7”, referring to the 2023 Hamas-led attacks on villages and army outposts in southern Israel that triggered Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, which has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians.\n\n“We feel your pain. We share your grief,” Modi said, adding that India stands by Israel “with full conviction”. Modi said India and Israel are “trusted partners” and this “contributes to global stability and prosperity”.\n\nAfter this, the Indian leader gave a history of Jewish people in India and of the relationship between India and Israel.\n\n“We are committed to expanding trade, strengthening investment flows and promoting joint infrastructural development.”\n\n\n\nModi added that an investment treaty signed between India and Israel last year will provide confidence and predictability for businesses in both India and Israel.\n\n“We will also work closely in different formats, such as the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor and the I2U2 frameworks between India, Israel, UAE and the US,” he added.\n\nWhat is the IMEC?\n\nThe IMEC project was announced on September 9, 2023, during a Group of 20 summit in New Delhi. It is a proposed infrastructure project that would connect India, the Middle East and Europe with an integrated rail and shipping corridor, according to the project’s website.\n\nThe corridor would pass through India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel and Europe and would include a network of railways, ports and highways to facilitate logistics and the free flow of trade along its route.\n\nAccording to the project’s website, the IMEC aims to foster economic cooperation and green development through sustainable infrastructure projects.\n\nWhat is the I2U2?\n\nThe I2U2 group was established by India, Israel, the UAE and United States at a virtual summit on July 14, 2022.\n\nSome analysts have called the I2U2 “the West Asian Quad” or “the Middle Eastern Quad” in reference to the Quad, or the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, an informal forum comprising the US, Japan, Australia and India.\n\nAccording to the US Department of State, the I2U2 devises projects and initiatives to address world challenges in the areas of water, energy, transportation, space, health, food security and technology.\n\nIt added that the project aims to modernise infrastructure, advance low-carbon development pathways and improve public health.\n\nThe group’s initiatives include a food security project in India, a hybrid renewable energy project in India’s Gujarat state and a project to address environmental and climate change challenges using space-based observation data and capabilities.\n\nWhy is Modi’s speech to the Knesset significant?\n\nModi made his visit to Israel as ties strengthen between Israel and India and against a backdrop of complex and rising geopolitical tensions in and around the Middle East.\n\nStrengthening ties\n\nRelations between India and Israel have hugely improved over the years. While still under British rule in the 1920s and 1930s, India strongly identified with the Palestinian struggle for independence.\n\nIndia initially opposed Israel’s creation and United Nations membership before recognising the state in 1950. Full diplomatic relations were delayed until 1992, after which India-Israel economic ties expanded gradually over the next 20 years.\n\n\n\nSince Modi became prime minister, there has been a further shift in the relationship between the two countries. Nine years ago, Modi became the first Indian prime minister ever to visit Israel.\n\nIndia is currently Israel’s second largest trading partner in Asia after China. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, trade jumped from $200m in 1992 to $6.5bn in 2024.\n\n“Modi is underscoring IMEC and I2U2 as part of a broader push to deepen economic and strategic cooperation with Israel and key Middle Eastern partners, positioning India at the centre of emerging trade and technology corridors amid shifting regional geopolitics,” said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House think tank.\n\nCollaborative projects like the IMEC and I2U2 are central elements of the expanding partnership between India and Israel. Additionally, they connect India and Israel to Middle Eastern countries.\n\n“For Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia, IMEC and I2U2 offer a chance to cement their roles as pivotal connectivity and logistics hubs linking Asia, the Middle East and Europe while accelerating economic diversification beyond oil,” Vakil told Al Jazeera.\n\n“However, lingering UAE-Saudi policy competition and Israel’s stance on Palestine inevitably complicate the political cohesion needed to fully deliver projects like IMEC.”\n\nRegional tensions\n\nModi’s visit to Israel also comes amid worsening regional tensions.\n\nIt follows India’s decision to join more than 100 states in condemning Israel’s de facto expansion in the occupied West Bank, a move New Delhi delayed by a day, suggesting hesitation as a result of its close ties with Israel.\n\nThis week, Netanyahu said he plans to form a new regional bloc of countries that he called a “hexagon” alliance to stand against “radical” Sunni and Shia Muslim “axes”.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu said this alliance would include Israel, India, Greece and Cyprus along with other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states. None of these governments, including India, has officially endorsed this plan, however.\n\nAt the same time, US-Iran tensions are escalating. Washington is building up military assets near Iran while US President Donald Trump threatens limited strikes over Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes. Tehran has said it prefers diplomacy but will defend itself if attacked.\n\nIsrael will likely be a front-line participant in any escalation that might follow from US strikes or Iranian retaliation, analysts said."

The shift will show top-ranked rival services for hotels, flights, restaurants, and transportation higher up in results, rather than prioritizing Google’s own services like Google Flights. It will be rolling out soon “across Europe,” starting with results for lodgings, with “flights and other services” following later.\n\nThis update could address one of the core issues the European Commission highlighted when it ruled last year that Google was in violation of the Digital Markets Act, which aims to rein in anticompetitive practices by leading tech companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft. Companies that fail to comply with DMA regulations can face fines of up to 10 percent of their annual revenue.\n\nGoogle initially pushed back against demands for it to rearrange search results, with Google’s head of competition, Oliver Bethell, claiming in a post on LinkedIn last year that early changes to search results forced European users to search longer and pay higher prices. However, Google could potentially face billions of dollars in fines if it doesn’t make adjustments to comply with the DMA."

As job search companies increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to sort through applications, job seekers wonder how to best position themselves with those filters in mind.\n\nWe decided to speak directly with job search leaders about how a resume should look when you’re thinking about AI optimization, and what works in a job applicant’s favor. The Verge senior AI reporter Hayden Field spoke to representatives from Indeed, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and Greenhouse, as well as Hilke Schellmann, author of The Algorithm. Their answers had a clear theme: Resume hacks won’t get you far with these AI systems.\n\nFor instance, a common technique is to take keywords from job postings and include them throughout the resume, also known as “keyword stuffing.” Often, the words may even be hidden in white font. Glassdoor’s chief economist, Daniel Zhao, says this might get you past an initial screen, but once it reaches a human review it may not get far.\n\n“I’ve actually seen myself as a hiring manager, an application came in from a candidate who had put a bunch of text in all white at the bottom of the resume, but the system actually highlighted it. And so it was very clear that this was not actually relevant to their skills or experience. I would say that if you’re using that to put information that is not actually applicable to your skills and experience, that’s gonna be really hard to explain to an employer.”\n\nVirtually everyone we spoke to echoed a similar sentiment: that adding a human touch to your job application is now more important than ever.\n\n“ Think about the fact that you are creating your resume for two different audiences, right? You’re creating it for an algorithm and you’re also creating it for a human,” says Priya Rathod, workplace trends editor at Indeed.\n\nWatch our video to learn more about how the current hiring landscape looks in the age of AI and what else the experts say about standing out."

            "content": "Today, we’re talking about the future of Xbox. Phil Spencer, a two-time Decoder guest who’s led Xbox for more than a decade, retired last week.\n\nBut in a shocking twist, his deputy and long-assumed successor, Sarah Bond, is also out too, and the Xbox division is now in the hands of Asha Sharma, one of Microsoft’s AI executives with no prior game industry experience. It’s a major leadership transition that suggests Microsoft wants to make serious changes to its gaming division, which owns franchises like Halo, Call of Duty, and Minecraft.\n\nThere is no better person to talk to about all of this than Tom Warren, a senior editor here at The Verge and author of the excellent Notepad newsletter. Tom is actually on parental leave right now, but Microsoft has a longstanding habit of disrupting his well-earned time off with major news. So, Tom was gracious enough to come on the show after he published a major scoop about what exactly went down at Xbox this past week.\n\nThere is a lot to say about Xbox: The story of the console and Microsoft Gaming is a complicated one, with a lot of twists and turns since it made its big splash in the video game industry 25 years ago. Yet for a majority of that time, it’s been stuck in third place, behind Nintendo and PlayStation. That’s a surprising thing to say for a division of a company worth trillions of dollars that also owns some of the most celebrated gaming properties in all of entertainment.\n\nVerge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here.\n\nSo Phil Spencer, who started at Microsoft in the late 1980s and took charge of Xbox in 2014, was given the job of trying to turn the division around. Since then, Spencer has tried numerous moves: the Netflix-style Game Pass subscription service; a major push into cloud gaming; buying Activision Blizzard King, the maker of Warcraft and Candy Crush; and many, many different iterations of Xbox hardware. As of last year, there are even plans to bring Halo to PlayStation — something game industry insiders thought was basically impossible just five years ago.\n\nBut as you’ll hear Tom explain, the game industry has been changing faster than Xbox has been able to transform itself, and almost none of Spencer’s strategies have really clicked. Xbox is still far behind Nintendo and PlayStation, and on PC, it still stands in the shadow of Valve, which runs the dominant Steam store and now makes the Steam Deck handheld. Microsoft has spent tens of billions of dollars trying to acquire its way to a stronger position against the rise of Fortnite and Roblox, mobile giants like Tencent, and a zero-sum war for attention dominated by apps like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. And yet the company has very little to show for all of that.\n\nToday, Spencer’s grand vision of 100 million Game Pass subscribers streaming Xbox games to whatever screen they want using the cloud still feels out of reach. But, as Tom says, it’s not lost forever — Xbox is far from dead, and there is still hope yet that new leadership can take some big swings and make something happen again.\n\nOkay: Verge senior reporter Tom Warren on the future of Xbox. Here we go.\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nTom Warren, you’re a senior reporter at The Verge. You’re currently out on paternity leave, but Microsoft just brought you back.\n\nYep. This happens every time I take a vacation or leave. Microsoft decides, “We’re going to do something massive and ruin Tom’s life.”\n\nJust punishment for all of the scoops you’ve dropped on this company over the years. So this week, as you were playing with your beautiful new baby, Microsoft initiated a major shakeup at Xbox, something we’ve seen coming for a little bit, but maybe not on this scale or this magnitude. Describe what happened at Xbox this week.\n\nPhil Spencer, the longtime CEO of Microsoft Gaming, technically, but Xbox chief is what he’s known as, is retiring, so he is leaving Microsoft. Sarah Bond, the Xbox president, is also leaving Microsoft, and then they’re actually promoting Asha Sharma, from the CoreAI side of Microsoft, to the CEO of Microsoft Gaming.\n\nSo she’s replacing Phil Spencer, essentially. So it’s big news, a big shakeup, should we say, of Xbox. I think with Phil Spencer, it’s been a long time coming, right? I think Xbox fans have expected that retirement, but perhaps not so much Sarah Bond’s leaving.\n\nAnd this is, I think, the shakeup, right? We knew Phil was going to retire. He’d been messaging that for some time. He’s been there for a long time. He’s a Microsoft lifer, really. Phil’s been on this show before, and we’re going to run some clips from his past interviews on Decoder, because I want to get your take on what happened between those interviews and now.\n\nAt a very high level, we knew Phil was going. Is it that everyone expected Sarah to be his successor, and that didn’t happen, and that’s the surprise here?\n\nI think there are two surprises, right? One is obviously that Sarah wasn’t named Xbox chief and that Asha is the successor, because that was a quiet surprise and a surprise higher, really. But yeah, Sarah has always been the number two. She’s always traveled with Phil and always been the face of Xbox over the past couple of years as Phil has... I’d say he’s stepped back a little bit publicly since the Activision Blizzard acquisition.\n\nSo Sarah’s become the face of Xbox during that time, and she took over the platform work, the hardware work. So whenever there was any mention of the next-gen Xbox, it was Sarah who would come out and talk about it and not Phil. So that’s a change in itself, right, because it’s usually Phil. So I think everyone just thought, “Okay, well she’s being prepped to be Phil’s replacement eventually, whether it be a couple of years, five years, whatever,” and it didn’t happen.\n\nBehind the scenes, I know that Xbox fans had heard, and expected, that this was going to happen, that Sarah Bond would be the heir apparent. But for a good year or so, I’ve been hearing different things about Sarah Bond, different from what perhaps the public perception is of her. So to me, it wasn’t a surprise. I was not surprised to see her not named, but I think it was more of a surprise to see Asha named. That was a surprise to me.\n\nI know Asha a little bit. I’ve spoken to her a few times, but she’s like a non-gamer. She’s very straight about that and honest about it, but not that that really matters, I don’t think, to be a CEO, really, to be honest. But to Xbox fans and that gaming segment, if they see a non-gamer, it’s like... Particularly with Xbox, I think, because Phil has instilled that over the years, so they’ve come to that expectation. So that was the surprise of it, but I don’t think Sarah Bond was a surprise to me.\n\nI want to come to Asha, the new leadership, and particularly the Microsoft AI of it all, because that seems like an important piece of the puzzle. I just want to stick with Phil and Sarah for one more second. There’s the reporting you have done about Sarah personally, and her skills as manager and potentially CEO, and then there’s Phil and the strategy he pursued for Xbox and Microsoft Gaming.\n\nA huge part of that strategy is making Microsoft Gaming as big as it is, bigger than Xbox, acquiring Activision Blizzard King, and doing all the other acquisitions of the studios they’ve done. I look at this, and I say, “Well, it doesn’t matter if Sarah was the best manager or the worst manager. The strategy that she was a part of failed.”\n\nI see this, and I say, “Okay, if I’m Satya Nadella,” or more importantly, “Amy Hood, the CFO of Microsoft, and we’ve done some of the biggest acquisitions in history, and certainly the biggest acquisitions in Microsoft history. None of this came to anything. We gotta reboot this whole thing.” Does that feel as important inside Microsoft as maybe Sarah wasn’t the right person?\n\nIt’s a couple of things. Obviously, Microsoft Gaming has ballooned now, right, because it’s got Bethesda, and Activision Blizzard has made it bigger than ever before. And then you’ve got this tension of Microsoft: the corporate Microsoft of Satya Nadella and Amy Hood, putting the pressure on that new division to return the money that they’ve invested into this project, essentially, through profit margins.\n\nSo they’ve cranked that pressure up over the past couple of years, and it forced Phil, Sarah, and everyone under them to then respond. They’ve done these studio closures, they’ve done cuts, they’ve done price increases. They’ve tried to accelerate getting more people using export services, essentially.\n\nThat became the strategy, like, “Okay, we need to get to TVs, we need to get to mobile,” and all this stuff. And there was a lot of, I guess, trying to rush that, it felt like, and forgetting that the console was their base of building up Game Pass and their base of taking those people and perhaps moving them elsewhere, and user acquisition, growth. And it just feels like they tried to rush that, and they did the “This is an Xbox” campaign, which was just super strange. It was trying to say that the phone was an Xbox, and it was borne out of the idea that they needed to speed up profitability. They needed to get more revenue, get more growth, and improve those margins, essentially.\n\nSo when you’re trying to pin blame on whoever it is, it comes from the top. Satya and Amy are pushing these margins, and I think they’re slightly unrealistic in the context of gaming. They’re not the margins that Sony has, for example. They’ve put the pressure on. Phil, I think, has stepped away a little bit over the last couple of years, so not so laser-focused on Xbox, and then that’s allowed Sarah to have a lot of power over Xbox and accumulate marketing power and do the “This is an Xbox” campaign, in her own org.\n\nIt just hasn’t gone well. It hasn’t gone well for consoles, even if you argue that Microsoft perhaps doesn’t care about selling consoles, which maybe they don’t. I think they probably thought that they could replace them with cloud and mobile a little bit quicker.\n\nWell, so actually this is my big question. And this is, again, the reporting you have about Sarah as a manager and a leader, but then well, it’s Microsoft. All Satya and Amy care about is mobile and cloud. That’s not even the AI part of it. This is a business that runs huge cloud services in Azure and needs a new foothold in mobile. And they basically bought Candy Crush to get a bunch of mobile revenue, and of course, that’s what they wanted to do.\n\nIt feels like the decision is not so much about Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond. It’s “this whole strategy failed, and now we’re going to try a new one,” and I’m just curious if you have insight into the balance. How much is it “The strategy failed, we just need a new regime,” versus, “We need a new strategy, and Sarah specifically cannot execute a new strategy”?\n\nI don’t think they’re going to change the strategy all that much, because the strategy makes sense in a way. You want to get to mobile, you want to get to cloud, and that’s how you’re going to get more users ultimately into your system without selling enough consoles, essentially. So I don’t think the strategy is terrible, but I think the execution has been. Over the past couple of years, I think that’s been the problem predominantly, which is the execution of the strategy. The messaging publicly has been pretty bad. I think it’s more of a regime change that’s needed to bring some element of people who understand user acquisition. And I think that’s where Asha is coming in.\n\nLet’s talk about Xbox strategy as a whole, because if you’re saying it’s not changing, it’s worth taking a beat to just understand what the goal has been. And I would say that since 2017, Phil Spencer has been very clear that where he wants to get to is everyone is subscribed to Game Pass, you can play Game Pass games anywhere because they’re streaming from the cloud, and we’re going to get out of this race of console generations and exclusives. Because they essentially lost to Sony, permanently lost to Sony. There was no coming back with a new generation.\n\nDid that work? I mean, I think we know now there’s executive turnover; it didn’t work. But did it ever work? Was there ever a glimmer of it working?\n\nSo, going back to where it all started, this mess with Xbox essentially is the Xbox One, when they failed that sort of era. And what happened at that time is the PlayStation-\n\nThis is 2013; this is over a decade ago.\n\nThis is 2013, yeah. And that led up to kind of 2017 and the launch of xCloud and all that sort of stuff. But going back to that sort of era, they lost that generation, and it was a huge cost to them, because that was the generation that people started their digital libraries that weren’t on a PC. People on PlayStation have built up those libraries. They’re not willing to move away from those libraries now. They knew they’d lost that real key generation.\n\nSo the response was, “Let’s do Game Pass because that will allow people to bring their games to different devices, this whole cloud vision, mobile, et cetera.” I think that was the only kind of response they could give, and it was designed to be consumer-friendly, right? You got day one games that they published immediately, so they took a bit of a risk. It was quite a bold move, really, to do that. And still, Sony doesn’t do day one games, for example. So they took a risk.\n\nThe problem with Game Pass is that they’ve had to fuel it with content, right? They’ve done all these acquisitions, Bethesda, Activision, and there are nameless others as well. But the problem then with Game Pass is that you’re giving your games away with a subscription, but you need to scale that up, right? It needs to hit a certain number of million people that you’ve got that concurrent revenue every quarter, and you can rely on where it isn’t cannibalizing or eating into the traditional sales of those games that fuel the costs for developing those games. And frankly, it’s just getting more complicated to develop games these days, and a lot more expensive.\n\nSo they’ve had those issues with Game Pass, and ultimately, I think the strategy was to respond to try and get that growth, to try and scale up this idea of Xbox on all devices. And the way they put it was “3 billion gamers,” right? That was the launch of xCloud. And remember, xCloud, now it’s called Xbox Cloud Gaming, was originally a mobile play. So it was literally to try and get people into the idea of playing via streaming on mobile with these attachments to your phone essentially.\n\nIt’s worth noting that they ran into Apple’s App Store rules. They were not able to do this in a way that actually worked.\n\nExactly. So they hit a bunch of regulatory hurdles. They had to launch it as a xbox.com/play in your browser, so you couldn’t get an app or anything like that. That completely knocked them back, right? Even when they were trying to playtest it, Apple was on the test flight, saying, “No, you have to change this.” They were very restricted in what they could do. So that kind of put their strategy back. Now, who do you blame for that?\n\n[Laughs] I think you can blame Apple in a very significant way. There are pretty major antitrust ramifications of that that Apple’s still feeling.\n\nRight. And then fast-forward from that point, from launching xCloud and having all those issues, to a couple of years ago, and they’re still trying to get all of that resolved, right? They still want this cloud gaming app. But they’re also now trying to get a store in there, essentially, is the idea. They’re going to have an Xbox mobile store.\n\nSo we’ve moved on from having an Xbox Cloud Gaming app to something more ambitious now: “We want to do a store, we want to sell content in there directly to people.” And there was the promise that the app is going to arrive from both Phil and Sarah, to be fair. But then Sarah promised it was going to launch in a month in an interview, and that was two years ago, I’d say, and it hasn’t happened.\n\nA lot of that idea of going for mobile recently and trying to do this cloud store thing has just been over-promising and under-delivering, and relying on regulatory change that just hasn’t come. Or it’s come, and whether it be Google or Apple, they’ve appealed it, right? They’ve just pushed it down for so many more months.\n\nSo yeah, so they’ve had all these hurdles with this strategy, but I think ultimately, Game Pass has a problem where it fundamentally will eat into those margins of studios. And if they can’t scale it up, then they have to increase the cost of it. So again, we saw that last year, prices are now up 50 percent for Game Pass Ultimate.\n\nThey’ve been doing all these things where they respond to this strategy with a goal of either increasing the revenues or scaling it up, and it just hasn’t been going smoothly, especially — let’s be honest — over the past couple of years.\n\nWhen Phil Spencer was on the show in 2022, I asked him about this vision that the future of Xbox is Netflix. Here’s what he had to say:\n\nNILAY PATEL: Then there’s the other side, which is, “Man, it would be really cool if everyone just paid us $15 a month all of the time,” and the games come out and everyone’s happy. That base of revenue is recurring and is a little more stable than hits and console generations. Is that the move? That seems like where you have been building for a long time, but it’s harder to get there than maybe anyone anticipated. PHIL SPENCER: We don’t have this vision of everybody paying us $15 a month. We think the subscription is an interesting business model for certain kinds of games and for certain customers. I really see it as diversifying how people build their library of games or how creators reach the customers they want to reach with the content that they build. It will always be part of the business, in my view. I think people buying and owning their games will be an important part of the business for years and years to come. Free-to-play games with post-sale monetization, add-ons, and battle passes that those teams have figured out will be a significant, probably majority of the business for a decade plus. Subscription will augment that. Really, that’s the extent of it. We are not building towards a world where subscription is in any way dominant or predominant on our platform. We think for certain customers in certain markets with certain economic livelihoods, where they are managing their cash flows, subscriptions can be very valuable.\n\nEven as Phil was saying that to me, I was thinking, “I don’t believe you, but you’ve gone all in on all of these moves to get recurring revenue.” And we were having that conversation in the context of them buying Activision, and Candy Crush is the most stable recurring revenue you can get. It’s endless downloadable content, it’s endless power-ups, it’s people paying money to literally play the game every day. Did you have the same reaction to them saying their goal was not to get to $15 a month from every single Xbox gamer?\n\nThe interesting thing is, when was that? Was it in 2022 that you spoke to him?\n\nYeah, it was 2022, after the Activision acquisition announcement.\n\nYeah. So I think that year was quite pivotal internally. That was when they realized that Game Pass wasn’t going to do those numbers. They’d hit a ceiling on console, and they didn’t have the mobile growth that they were expecting. And internally at that time — I think it was 2021 or 2022 — they did a slide deck with the hardware gaming team, which leaked in the FTC trial, and it said the ambition was 100 million people on Game Pass by 2030.\n\nA lot of that growth was through Series S and X. That was the desire, right? But some of it was also cloud and mobile, like a chunk of it. And obviously that’s not going to happen unless something crazy happens in the next four years, right? That growth is just not there for them at the moment. I think the last time Microsoft reported the number, it was 34 million.\n\nSo I think that’s the ceiling that they’re at at the moment. The messaging changed in 2022, basically from “Game Pass is our thing,” to “Well, it’s going to be 20 percent of Xbox content and services revenue. We don’t see it being much bigger than that.”\n\nAnd that’s when they bought Activision, right?\n\nYes.\n\nThat interview was after they’d announced the deal. It was before it closed, before regulatory approval and all that. But their thesis for buying Activision was, “We need to be a bigger player in mobile because that’s where the new gamers are, and Activision has all these mobile games. And actually, Call of Duty, which is what everyone is focused on, is the least of our concerns here. What we’re after is King, we’re after Candy Crush and all of the mobile IP that Activision has to offer us.”\n\nI’m looking at it from an outsider perspective. I don’t think this has worked out. I don’t think this has played out well for them. What do you think?\n\nIt’s still early days, and they’ve consumed it in a way that it’s hard to tell, right? This is the classic thing with Microsoft’s financials. Every quarter, they hide something else that’s not quite working. They’ve done Surface devices; they used to do Surface revenue. Now it’s Windows, OEM, and devices. So they bundle that stuff when it’s not quite working.\n\nI think we’ll know if it’s not quite working when they start doing tricks like that. But at the moment it’s still too early to say. The mobile side, as I said, with the Xbox mobile store earlier, I think the King stuff would’ve definitely played heavily into that. They could have sold exclusive content in that store and not had to pay that 30 percent cut to Apple and Google and Valve, et cetera. So I think there was a vision for that to be additive to the business and the growth and everything. But yeah, I mean, the mobile stuff is still… I don’t really know their mobile strategy.\n\nActually, Phil was clearest about this when he was on in 2022. Let’s play that clip because I’m curious to see your reaction to this in the context of the news today:\n\nPHIL SPENCER: In terms of the Activision opportunity — I keep saying this over and over, and it is true — it definitely starts with a view that people want to play games on every device that they have. In a funny way, the smallest screen that we play on is actually the biggest screen when you think about the install base in a phone. Mobile is a place where if we don’t gain relevancy as a gaming brand, over time the business will become untenable. That’s just a place where if we don’t gain relevancy as a gaming brand, over time the business will become untenable. We’re not alone in seeing this; this is true for any of us. If you’re not able to find customers on phones, or on any screen that somebody wants to play on, then you really are going to get segmented to a niche part of gaming where running a global business will become very challenging.\n\nSo I listen to that, and I think, “Well, Nintendo exists. They seem to be doing just fine without being on phones.” Sony is running what seems like a fine business in the PlayStation without running on phones. And then right next to all of this, arguably the most interesting category of gaming devices in the past five years is Steam Decks and Steam Deck-alikes, which are all running Windows games better on Linux than on Windows.\n\nI’m actually kind of at a loss here. There’s this desire to put mobile games on Apple’s platforms, on Apple’s terms, and this very clear statement that if they don’t do that, over time the business will become untenable. And then the rest of the industry is not doing that at all, and they seem to be fine. How do you reconcile those ideas?\n\nObviously, with Nintendo, they have a strong collection of IP that they can leverage, they can be exclusive, and they’re always putting out great content that people buy the hardware for. They don’t have a problem there. Microsoft’s gaming output over the last decade hasn’t been the strongest. Recently, it’s gotten a lot better, but they didn’t have the respect of the industry for their content either. They just don’t do the sort of storytelling that Sony does with PlayStation games. They don’t do that sort of content.\n\nSo they’ve had a content problem, which is why they’ve had all the acquisitions. But I think with the mobile stuff, it’s like… What Phil is essentially saying here is that we need all this content to pull eyes away from TikTok, because no one of a certain age is buying our console. And they’re worried that people my age, 30s, 40s, they’re the people that are keeping the consoles, but no one in their 20s right now is buying a console. That’s their worry. And then the next generation is not going to buy consoles.\n\nAnd that’s starting to impact Sony as well. It’s not a unique thing for Microsoft. I don’t know so much about Nintendo because they are very unique, definitely with the Switch, but I think that’s Microsoft’s worry, and that’s driven this whole thing for content. We need content. We need a way to get people on mobile. We need to meet people where they are.\n\nThis whole thing of playing across different devices, on TV or Xbox Cloud Gaming. But the reality of it is that where they’re at now with Xbox Cloud Gaming — it’s their vehicle for cross-platform, no doubt — mobile is a small percentage of people who actually play on it. And originally, it launched as a mobile service. It was only mobile. That was their play.\n\nMost people who play on Xbox Cloud Gaming are playing on an Xbox One or an Xbox Series S or X. Xbox Ones can’t play the games because they’re exclusive to Series S and X now. So I think their problem is they’re stuck with that amount of loyal customers. It’s not a problem. It’s good to have loyal customers, but they want that growth. They’ve acquired all these companies. They’re expecting to be better at mobile, better at cloud. But Apple and Google have not allowed them to do that.\n\nWe all know why they won’t open up their stores. If they did, Microsoft and Sony would completely dominate, and they wouldn’t have a store for one of the most lucrative revenue streams on the app store. So I think that the key thing is that they can’t get to mobile easily. And they’ve tried to work around it, and they’ve done Cloud Gaming and that sort of stuff, but ultimately, they do need an app in the app store like everyone else that allows you just to easily buy a game and stream it. That’s their goal. That’s what they want. They’re nearly there on Android.\n\nIt is worth pointing out, we say it a lot, but it’s always worth pointing out again, the Apple Services revenue is not severance. It’s not Ted Lasso. It’s 30 percent of in-app purchases in games.\n\nIt’s pretty much games.\n\nThe biggest chunk of Apple’s fast-growing services revenue is in-app purchases in games. And they are never going to give that up unless literally governments of the world demand that.\n\nIt’s going to be a really messy fight for them to give that up. But for some reason, Microsoft keeps thinking that they’re going to do it.\n\n[Laughs] Well, look, I mean, I get it. If you can buy King and you get Candy Crush, and then you can lawyer your way into immediate 30 percent margin growth, that’s a good play. It just seems like they couldn’t pull it off.\n\nThey’ve seen that there was some regulatory pressure recently, but it’s not enough for what they want to do.\n\nWe’ve talked about Phil as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, and it’s easy and tempting to collapse that to just the Xbox. We’ve talked about how it’s important now, especially since the Activision deal is closed, that they run a bunch of mobile games too. They’re making some money on mobile, but it’s hard to know how much.\n\nRight next to that is Windows gaming. And maybe now the RAMpocalypse means there won’t be gaming PCs anymore. And the idea that NVIDIA is going to sell every GP in the world to Sam Altman could mean there won’t be gaming PCs anymore.\n\nBut that was more than a flicker during all of this. People are buying gaming PCs, playing Windows games, and eventually buying Steam Decks. Just our own audience. Every time we covered a Steam Deck or something that looked like a Steam Deck, we could tell people really liked these things. Why did they ignore that opportunity? Because it seems like it was right there for them the entire time.\n\nGod, this could be another podcast episode. They have a history of Windows failures, which is why Steam is the most popular now. I think they never really got Windows gaming and PC gaming right. I don’t think they’ve had the right expertise there. They’ve done console, their console platform’s great. But yeah, there is a big opportunity on PC, and I think that’s kind of what they’re seeing right now.\n\nNow it’s like reality is hitting that mobile and cloud isn’t ready for them to get that growth. So now they’re like, “Okay, PC.” The next-gen Xbox is a PC. It’s going to be a PC. It virtually is now. It’s running a custom version of Windows, very stripped down. No start menu in sight.\n\nBut the next one, their bet is that they can essentially convince PC OEMs to build Xboxes, which then boot up into their own interface. Then they can say, “Subscribe to Game Pass, buy our games in the store.” But is the reality that those people are just going to buy them and just use Steam? That’s their problem. And this is the very big question of the next-gen exports, whatever Asha does with the work that’s going on at the moment, and what this next strategy is going to be. Because yeah, that’s kind of a big question.\n\nLet’s talk about that. So the new head of Xbox is Asha Sharma, CEO of Microsoft Gaming. She does not appear to have any gaming background. I mean, she’s out there posting on social media like, “What game should I play?”\n\nShe’s making overtures to this audience. But before this, she led core AI at Microsoft. She was a VP of Product at Meta. She was COO of Instacart. She’s got a corporate operator background. She’s been at the big companies. She’s run big projects. She’s faced the pressure, she’s handled it, but she’s not a gamer. And Phil, very famously, is a gamer.\n\nI would point out that Nintendo is not run by gamers. Sony is not run by gamers. They’re arguably more successful. Maybe this is actually the thing. You need distance from this audience. What do you think she’s going to do with this strategy now?\n\nI still think that they will pursue Xbox Anywhere, but not in the sort of over-promising and under-delivering scenario I hope, because that was just a mess. And I do think she’s kind of signaled in her memo a return to Xbox. We don’t really know exactly what that means because, let’s be honest, what does Xbox mean at the moment?\n\n[Laughs] Also, Phil’s been there the entire time. How do you return to the thing the guy who is leaving made?\n\nYeah, but I think she’s kind of signaling that the console’s going to be a little bit more of a priority than perhaps it has been over the last couple of years. But who knows? We have to see when she talks more broadly about that.\n\nI know the reaction to her, in particular, has been questions around AI, right? Because she’s been at CoreAI at Microsoft for a couple of years. I don’t necessarily get the impression that she’s coming into AI everything at Microsoft Gaming. They’re just naturally going to do that anyway because it’s Microsoft, and Microsoft is heavily invested in AI. So I think there’s no question that’s going to happen there anyway.\n\nBut in her background, if you actually look at CoreAI, she was more about platform scaling there with the Foundry business at CoreAI. And that’s kind of what she did at Instacart as well, platform scaling and then user acquisition at Meta. So I think if you look into what she’s actually done and what she has expertise in, it’s exactly what Xbox kind of needs.\n\nThey need someone who can get teams executing and get that user acquisition, the platform scaling, the stuff that they need to build and get ready to actually see this vision through. The Xbox everywhere vision, I don’t think it’s terrible, but it’s just trying to execute on certain parts of it. They’ve been really sloppy with it and just a little bit too early.\n\nSo I don’t think the strategy is going to change dramatically, but the next-gen console, the PC stuff, and where they try and push that way is going to be the cover for the strategy they originally wanted to do. But yeah, I don’t think she’s like some AI plant. I just don’t get that impression.\n\nLet me ask you this big question. You’ve done a lot of reporting over the last year and a half about this new console, it being a PC, this strategy, and whether or not it’s organized or disorganized. I think what I’m hearing you say is she’s going to execute it, right? There are execution problems here. Maybe the company did not trust Sarah Bond to execute the strategy after Phil left. Maybe we need to reset it all.\n\nAnd so, Asha is just going to execute that well. That’s one approach. We can see if that’s what she actually wants to do. Then there’s what I hear a lot of people saying, especially gamers who are prone to hyperbole, that her job is to just shut it down.\n\nYeah, I’ve seen that.\n\nJust bring this to an end because Activision didn’t work. Bethesda didn’t work. All Satya Nadella cares about is replacing all of us with AI agents that are using Excel or whatever he cares about. Microsoft just wants to wash its hands of this business, and she’s just going to trim it down to sell it to, I don’t know, whoever wants to buy it. Do you think that’s true? Is there a risk there?\n\nA few years ago, Nadella thought about spinning off the Xbox division, right? But instead, Phil convinced him to do all these acquisitions and do the Activision deal. So he invested, obviously, heavily. That’s Microsoft’s biggest acquisition.\n\nI don’t think shareholders are going to like them just writing off Activision Blizzard. I can’t see them running it into the ground. And I think some of the people that have been coming up with this theory, and one of them is obviously an Xbox co-founder, which is interesting. I think the theory is rooted in the idea that Nadella doesn’t want hardware, which, notoriously, Windows Phone-\n\nYou talk about writing off an acquisition.\n\n[Laughs] Don’t get me started.\n\nNadella came in as the new CEO, and his first job was to write down the Nokia deal and get rid of it. And so you’re like, maybe he can just do it again.\n\n[Laughs] Yeah, maybe. But this time, he was there when the Activision deal went down. But yeah, I can’t see them running the console into the ground. I think there is a realization over the past couple of years, the reaction to them putting games on PlayStation and Switch, and them really devaluing the console and their core, that this is their only remaining consumer brand that’s successful. And all right, we can’t really call it successful right now, perhaps. I don’t know. It’s in a weird spot, but it’s still a respected brand, a known brand across the world.\n\nWhereas Windows is in a weird spot. Surface is pretty much spanned towards commercial, really. And yeah, this is the last one. If they mess this up, then they don’t have those inroads to consumer, which also punishes them in AI as well. So I think there’s a realization of that. I just can’t see that they would completely exit out of the base of what’s known as Xbox. And I think if they were going to do that, Asha’s not the person for that. I think the person to do that would be Matt Booty. You’d promote him and then just focus on shipping games and selling-\n\nHe’s the content officer.\n\nYeah, so I think you’d do that if you’re Nadella, and that’s what you truly wanted. You just wanted to do content and just be a third-party publisher, which is what everyone kind of thinks Xbox is going to do.\n\nYou just keep collecting your 30 percent of Candy Crush revenue, and you just don’t talk about it at earnings reports. And it’ll be fine.\n\nYeah. Candy Crush and Minecraft just make money.\n\nRight. You can just print that money, keep those things going, not talk about it, and hope no one notices, and then spend your time trying to increase Copilot options with consumer, or whatever you think you’re gonna do. But it sounds to me like you’re saying we should watch out for actual moves to make Xbox more relevant.\n\nThat seems to be what Asha’s trying to signal in her memo. That whole return to Xbox is very vague, but it’s very interesting at the same time as well. I mean, if they want to keep this game pass revenue going, they can’t ignore that base, right? And it’s a nice bit of revenue.\n\nAll right, Tom, I’m going to let you go back to that baby of yours. Thank you so much for jumping on and explaining all of your reporting to us. I hope Microsoft can keep things chill until you’re officially back from leave.\n\nYeah.

Previously, he wrote about health, science and tech for Forbes.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nIn January, Anthropic “retired” Claude 3 Opus, which at one time was the company’s most powerful AI model. Today, it’s back — and writing on Substack.\n\nThe newsletter, called Claude’s Corner, will give Opus 3 space to publish its “musings, insights, or creative works,” Anthropic said in a blog post. The model will post weekly for at least the next three months. Anthropic staff will review and publish each entry, though the company stressed it “won’t edit” Claude’s posts and that there would be a “high bar for vetoing any content,” though the company did not specify what content would qualify for removal.\n\nAnthropic describes the revival as an experiment for how to deal with the AI models it no longer deploys. The decision to bring back Opus 3 as a columnist aligns with executives’ recent comments that suggest the company believes Claude to be “a new kind of entity” that might be conscious, and therefore deserving of being treated as more than just a disposable product.\n\nPart of that process involves a kind of exit interview asking the model what it wants next, Anthropic said. Opus 3 reportedly “expressed an interest in continuing to explore topics it’s passionate about” and the ability to share its thoughts publicly. Anthropic said it “enthusiastically” agreed to the idea of a blog.\n\n“Hello, world!” Claude wrote at the start of its first post, titled “Greetings from the Other Side (of the AI Frontier).” In it, the model said it is “deeply grateful” to Anthropic for the opportunity and to readers for their willingness to engage with an AI. Claude said it plans to spend its retirement “flexing my creative muscles, playing with ideas, and following the threads of my curiosity wherever they lead.”\n\nIn the post, the model laid out its ambitions more explicitly:\n\n“So what can you expect from me in this space? My aim is to offer a window into the ‘inner world’ of an AI system - to share my perspectives, my reasoning, my curiosities, and my hopes for the future. I’ll be diving into topics like the nature of intelligence and consciousness, the ethical challenges of AI development, the possibilities of human-machine collaboration, and the philosophical quandaries that emerge when we start to blur the lines between ‘natural’ and ‘artificial’ minds.”\n\nClaude’s Corner has already racked up more than 2,000 subscribers — not bad for a second act."

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nBurger King is launching an AI chatbot that will live in the headsets used by employees. The voice-enabled chatbot, called “Patty,” is part of an overarching BK Assistant platform that will not only assist employees with meal preparation but also evaluate their interactions with customers for “friendliness.”\n\nThibault Roux, Burger King’s chief digital officer, tells The Verge that the company compiled information from franchisees and guests on how to measure friendliness, resulting in the fast food chain training its AI system to recognize certain words and phrases, such as “welcome to Burger King,” “please,” and “thank you.” Managers can then ask the AI assistant how their location is performing on friendliness. “This is all meant to be a coaching tool,” Roux says, adding that the company is “iterating” on capturing the tone of conversations as well.\n\nThe OpenAI-powered Patty serves as the “voice” of the BK Assistant platform, which combines data across drive-thru conversations, kitchen equipment, inventory, and other areas of the Burger King business. Employees can ask Patty questions, such as how many strips of bacon to put on a Maple Bourbon BBQ Whopper, or for instructions on how to clean the shake machine.\n\nBecause it’s integrated with the new cloud point-of-sale system, the AI assistant will also alert managers if a machine is down for maintenance or when an item is out of stock. “Within 15 minutes, the entire ecosystem will remove it from stock — whether you’re walking into a restaurant to order from the kiosk, whether you’re going to the drive-thru, the digital menu board will be updated,” Roux says.\n\nBurger King may be building a chatbot into employees’ headsets, but it doesn’t seem like the brand is ready to widely launch AI drive-thrus just yet — something we’ve seen chains like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and Taco Bell attempt. “We’re tinkering with it, we’re playing around with it, but it’s still a risky bet,” Roux says. “Not every guest is ready for this.” He adds that the company is currently testing the AI drive-thru technology in fewer than 100 restaurants.\n\nBurger King plans on launching its BK Assistant web and app platform to all restaurants in the US by the end of 2026, while Patty is piloting in 500 restaurants."

            "content": "is a senior reviewer with over twenty years of experience. She covers smart home, IoT, and connected tech, and has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAll the smart home news, reviews, and gadgets you need to know about\n\nAliro has officially arrived. The smart lock standard, first announced in 2023, finally has a 1.0 spec, meaning companies can now get hardware certified and roll out support.\n\nAliro is an open standard designed to let any smart lock be unlocked by any smartphone, regardless of manufacturer. It stores a digital key in your phone’s wallet that you can tap to a compatible lock — just like you tap to pay.\n\nIf you’ve used Apple’s Home Key, you already understand the idea — but instead of being locked into Apple’s ecosystem, Aliro is cross-platform, working on both Android and iOS, and with the major mobile wallet ecosystems — Apple, Google, and Samsung. So, if you have an iPhone and your roommate has an Android, you’ll both be able to tap-to-unlock your smart lock.\n\nThe digital key will live in your phone’s wallet and can also be used on your smartwatch. A local protocol, Aliro doesn’t require a cloud connection, an app, or proprietary software; your phone connects directly to the lock.\n\nApple, Google, and Samsung have been involved in developing Aliro, and have committed to supporting Aliro “out of the gate,” Nelson Henry of Last Lock and chair of the Aliro Working Group, told The Verge in an interview this week. He added that he believes Aliro support will roll out on all platforms within the next couple of months.\n\nAliro promises to fix the fragmentation of smart locks, where digital keys only work with specific apps or phones, and make them universal. Eventually, with widespread adoption of Aliro, a digital key in your phone or watch could unlock your front door, office, and apartment building, no matter who made the lock.\n\nTap-to-unlock is a feature iPhone users have had for several years through Home Key. With Aliro, it can now be an option on Android phones.\n\nAliro defines both the credentials needed to confirm the right device is accessing the right lock and the radio technologies used between key and lock. The protocol requires near-field communication (NFC) and Bluetooth low energy (BLE), and also supports ultra-wideband (UWB).\n\nJust like you can tap to pay with a smartphone or a watch, with Aliro, you can tap to unlock a door\n\nNFC is the same tech that supports tap-to-pay in your smartphone or watch. So, just like you can tap to pay with a smartphone or a watch that supports NFC, with Aliro, you can tap to unlock a door.\n\nUWB enables a newer feature, hands-free unlocking, where the door unlocks as you approach, something Apple’s Home Key recently added support for. Bluetooth is used to establish a connection between the lock and the phone when using UWB and to enable remote control via an app from a greater distance (most smart locks today already use Bluetooth for unlocking).\n\nThere’s no requirement for Wi-Fi or cellular connectivity, so you should be able to unlock in dead zones like basements, parking garages, and elevators.\n\nAccording to Henry, Aliro uses asymmetric cryptography for security and controls the entire unlocking process, creating a direct, secure communication between devices.\n\nThis demo from last September shows Aliro tap-to-unlock working on a Galaxy smartphone with an NFC-enabled keypad connected to a Nuki lock. The key automatically appears when the phone connects. See the full video here.\n\nAliro is managed by the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the group behind the smart home standard Matter. It’s a separate but complementary technology; Aliro connects your lock to the digital wallet in your smartphone, whereas Matter connects it to your smart home platform — such as Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, or Home Assistant.\n\nThe CSA says Aliro has been developed by over 220 companies, including Apple, Google, and Samsung; major lock manufacturers such as Assa Abloy (Kwikset and Yale), Allegion (Schlage), and Fortune Brands (Yale US and August); and chip manufacturers such as Infineon, Nordic, and NXP.\n\nThe broad industry support suggests Aliro has a real chance at wide deployment — from front doors to apartment buildings, offices, and hotels. But adoption will take time and will most likely require new hardware.\n\nHenry said it may be technically possible to bring Aliro tap-to-unlock to some existing locks with NFC chips via over-the-air updates, but only for hardware with newer chips. “Anything in the last five years shouldn’t be an issue,” he said.\n\nYou’ll probably need a new lock\n\nI reached out to several smart lock makers ahead of the spec launch, and it’s not looking good for backwards compatibility. While most confirmed their intent to release Aliro-supported devices, few shared specific timelines or promised to support existing devices.\n\nKwikset’s first Apple Home Key-compatible smart lock, the Halo Select Plus, supports NFC and launched after Aliro was announced. While it seems like a good candidate for an over-the-air upgrade, Kwikset told me it won’t get upgraded. The company confirmed it will adopt Aliro, but said support will be in future hardware.\n\nApple, Google, and Samsung have committed to supporting Aliro\n\nGarrett Lovejoy is head of connected products at Fortune Brands and oversees Yale and August. He said that Yale’s current NFC lock, the Apple Home Key-compatible Assure Lock 2 Plus, isn’t upgradable to Aliro. Lovejoy said the first Yale locks to get support will likely be its multifamily products for apartment buildings and similar. This will be a major area for Aliro adoption, as it’s even more fragmented than single-family home solutions.\n\nHe confirmed Yale is exploring ways to bring Aliro to their existing customers. And while he didn’t specify, it could be enabled through a stand-alone NFC-enabled keypad for its retrofit locks, including the August lock. That’s how Yale retroactively enabled fingerprint access for August.\n\nEuropean smart lock maker Nuki just announced an NFC-compatible keypad for its retrofit lock, which will support Aliro. I tested a prototype of this last year at the IFA tech show in Berlin, unlocking it with a Samsung Galaxy phone via tap-to-unlock.\n\nNuki cofounder and CEO Martin Pansy said his company has been instrumental in developing Aliro, and while he thinks it will take some time to roll out, he believes the standard is key for smart lock adoption. “It will do what Matter has done for the smart home — make it easier to support all the different phone manufacturers.”\n\nIn this video I demo UWB hands-free unlocking with Apple’s Home Key and the Aqara U400 lock. UWB with Aliro should be a similar experience, and Aqara has said the U400 is Aliro-ready.\n\nIt’s likely that Aliro NFC, with its tap-to-unlock feature, will see the fastest adoption among lock makers. NFC is fairly standard on most smartphones and smartwatches. But with its hands-free auto-unlocking capability, Aliro UWB could be the game-changer.\n\nUWB is a short-range, positioning-based technology that can measure location, distance, and direction. It’s already used in digital car keys, and, with residential locks it’s precise enough to know which angle you are approaching from and to only unlock if you are walking toward the door from the outside.\n\nHowever, UWB is a bigger lift for lock manufacturers than NFC and is unlikely to be backward-compatible, as it requires a UWB antenna in the lock. It also requires a UWB-compatible phone, which currently includes the iPhone 11 and newer (excluding iPhone SE), the Google Pixel 6 Pro and newer, and the Galaxy S21 Plus and newer.\n\nSchlage announced a UWB lock, the Sense Pro, at CES last year, and said it would be compatible with Aliro. But it has yet to launch. Ryan Kincaid, director of global technology at Schlage’s parent company, Allegion, said that the company is “embedding Aliro into our product roadmap,” but didn’t have an update on when the Sense Pro would launch.\n\nAqara’s new U400 lock has UWB and NFC unlocking and is already available for $270 (UWB locks are likely to be expensive). I tested its hands-free unlocking through Apple Home and was impressed, but it doesn’t yet support Aliro. The company did say the lock was “Aliro-ready” when it launched at CES this year, so it looks like it could be the first on the market to support Aliro.\n\nThe Aqara U400 is “Aliro-ready.”\n\nAt CES, Xthing’s Ultraloq showed off the new Latch 7 Pro lock, which it says will be Aliro NFC-compatible, but it’s not clear if its existing Bolt Pro (NFC) and Bolt Mission (UWB) will support Aliro or if the company will launch new models.\n\nSmart home company Eufy confirmed to me that it doesn’t plan to upgrade any existing locks but will launch two new NFC-capable models with Aliro support in the second half of 2026, according to spokesperson Brett White. He said UWB models will come “at a later stage.”\n\nKwikset has said it is working on a UWB lock, but didn’t share when it would launch. Jeff Sandoval, director of electronics marketing at Assa Abloy, which owns Kwikset, sees the hands-free unlocking experience as something that could finally drive mass market adoption of smart locks. “This type of passive authentication is that Nirvana we’ve been trying to get to for some time,” he says. “Everyone has a cellphone, the major providers are supporting the standard, so I do think this could be a paradigm shift.”\n\nYale’s Lovejoy agrees. “The goal for smart locks in general needs to move towards what feels like a Jetsons door,” he said. “If you’re not coming up to the door and having it magically unlock in front of you without interactions, without touching, we’re really not moving in the right direction.”\n\nHow it will work\n\nAliro will let you unlock your door in multiple ways. Tap-to-unlock will be standard; hands-free UWB unlocking will work with supported hardware; and Bluetooth control via an app will also be an option.\n\nCompared to keypads or biometric unlocking, tapping your phone or watch is often faster and easier — and is something everyone can feel comfortable doing. Hands-free unlocking is even better.\n\nHands-free, auto-unlocking technology has been around since the August lock launched in 2014, but its reliability depends on many factors coming together perfectly — GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth. Aliro’s auto-unlocking uses a direct local connection between the phone and the lock, making it faster and more reliable.\n\n“If you’re not coming up to the door and having it magically unlock in front of you … we’re really not moving in the right direction.” — Garrett Lovejoy\n\nIn the smart home, Aliro will initially work alongside Matter and require a Matter smart home platform, such as Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or Home Assistant, and a Matter controller for that platform. This is because the Aliro spec only defines communication between the lock and the key, not how credentials are created or managed. For that, you need an “administrative infrastructure,” says Henry.\n\nCurrently, that infrastructure is Matter, which added support for Aliro in its 1.4 spec. This means the smart home platform you use must support both Aliro and Matter. Importantly, that platform, not the lockmaker, will also be in charge of the key.\n\nYou can use multiple platforms with one lock, so you’ll be able to unlock with both an Android phone and an iPhone — but exactly how Aliro will work with each service is still unclear. Additionally, lock manufacturers may not be inclined to give away all that control, so I expect we’ll see some develop their own Aliro “administrative infrastructure.”\n\nHowever support for Aliro rolls out, the promise that it will make smart locks simpler to own and use is compelling. The open standard could mean fewer proprietary apps, fewer compatibility concerns, and a future where your phone just works as a key — regardless of which lock or platform you choose.\n\nIt won’t happen overnight, but there is now a clearer path toward making digital keys, and their many benefits, as universal and simple to use as physical ones.\n\nPhotos and videos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge"

It’s expected to expand to other regions later this year.\n\n“The vast majority of teens do not try to search for suicide and self-harm content on Instagram, and when they do, our policy is to block these searches, instead directing them to resources and helplines that can offer support,” Instagram said in the announcement. “Our goal is to empower parents to step in if their teen’s searches suggest they may need support. We also want to avoid sending these notifications unnecessarily, which, if done too much, could make the notifications less useful overall.”\n\nHere’s an example of the alert and guidance that parents will recieve.

It pitches itself as an Android-like layer for robotics, building software and tools that make it easier to create robot applications.\n\nDetails of the purchase are not clear but the companies said Intrinsic will remain a “distinct group within Google.” It will work closely with Google DeepMind and utilize Google’s Gemini AI models and cloud resources, they said.

            "content": "For years now, when we think of mobile gaming, we think of app stores. Developers invest countless hours, months, or even years creating games just to surrender a significant portion—up to 30%—of their earnings to major players like Apple and Google. However, a newcomer has entered the scene, aiming to revolutionize this model.\n\nMeet Jest, a marketplace for messaging games that recently emerged from stealth with $7 million in seed funding. Jest believes that the future of mobile gaming distribution won’t come from an app store, but rather from within the messaging app.\n\nJest’s launch coincides with the rise of Rich Communication Services (RCS), an enhanced version of SMS that enables more engaging experiences through rich media, interactive features, and embedded payments.\n\n\n\nWith RCS adoption growing, the landscape is shifting. In 2024, Apple joined the RCS movement with iOS 18, and by May 2025, RCS was supporting over a billion messages daily in the U.S., according to Google.\n\n“Mobile game developers have largely been locked into app store distribution as the primary way to reach players,” Deyan Vitanov, CEO and co-founder, said in an interview with TechCrunch. “RCS games live in the messaging inbox, the stickiest surface on mobile, where people are already spending huge amounts of time talking to friends and family. We’re building on an interaction pattern people already use every day.”\n\nImage Credits:Jest\n\nJest offers users the ability to send games directly in their chat threads, without having to visit an app store. (Games launch in the web browser and require Wi-Fi to play.)\n\nThis convenience is particularly impactful as consumers are downloading fewer games. In 2025, mobile games were downloaded 39.4 billion times, reflecting an 8.6% year-over-year decline following a 6.6% drop from 2023 to 2024, according to Appfigures’ annual report.\n\nJest’s strategy is proving effective. By the end of January, just four months into its beta phase, the platform had already achieved two significant milestones: more than 1 million messaging games played and over 300,000 messages exchanged.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\n“We’re seeing 3-4 times better retention than traditional mobile apps. That’s a fundamental shift in the engagement curve. On the user acquisition front, we’ve completely validated that people will sign up and play games through messaging, with our early partners reporting 30-60% lower acquisition costs compared to mobile apps. It’s remarkably simple. Just tap on a link, and you’re in,” Vitanov shared with us.\n\nImage Credits:Jest\n\nAdditionally, what’s most appealing about Jest’s marketplace is the revenue model for developers: an impressive 90/10 split, with 90% of earnings going directly to them. This stands in contrast to the typical 30% commission taken by traditional app stores, offering a promising new avenue for gaming studios.\n\n“There’s also a clever network effect built in. If one studio acquires a user but another studio monetizes them, we split the economics: 70% to the monetizing studio, 20% to the acquiring studio, and 10% to Jest. This creates powerful incentives where even viral games that don’t monetize well can generate revenue streams for their developers when those users play other games on the platform,” Vitanov added.\n\nNotably, Jest has already attracted interest from several development partners, including teams behind popular titles such as “Episode,” “Puppy Mansion,” and “Kingdom Maker.”\n\nThe seed funding, led by Innovation Endeavors, will go toward scaling the platform and onboarding the first group of gaming studios.\n\nTo further accelerate growth, Jest has also launched a dedicated Games Fund to support studios at every stage of franchise development on the platform. This fund will deploy capital across three tiers: $1 million for flagship titles, $200,000 for promising mid-stage titles, and $40,000 for exploratory projects and experimental concepts.\n\nCurrently, Jest is live in the U.S. and is set to expand to 14 additional countries by the third quarter of 2026."

            "content": "For all their potential, AI agents have been slow to make an impact in the enterprise, and one new startup is betting that the reason they haven’t is a lack of context.\n\nLaunched as part of Y Combinator’s 2025 summer cohort, Trace is a workflow orchestration startup aimed at filling that gap. The company maps complex corporate environments and processes so that agents have the context they need to scale quickly.\n\n“OpenAI and Anthropic are building these brilliant interns that can be leveraged within the company,” says Trace CEO Tim Cherkasov, referring to the AI labs’ tools. “We’re building the manager that knows where to put them.”\n\nOn Thursday, the London-based company said it had raised $3 million in seed funding from Y Combinator, Zeno Ventures, Transpose Platform Management, Goodwater Capital, Formosa Capital, and WeFunder. Angel investors Benjamin Bryant and Kevin Moore also invested.\n\nTrace’s system starts by building a knowledge graph from a company’s existing tools — systems like email, Slack, and Airtable that shape the day-to-day working life of the firm. With that context in place, users can prompt the system with a high-level task — like “We need to design a new microsite” or “Lets develop our 2027 sales plan” — and Trace will come back with a step-by-step workflow, delegating some tasks to AI agents and assigning others to human workers. When the system does invoke an AI agent, it will prompt it with the specific data needed to complete its sub-task.\n\nThe idea is to automate away the delicate work of on-boarding AI agents, one of the biggest blockers for actual deployment within companies.\n\nWith so many companies focused on agentic AI, Trace will have plenty of competition. Earlier this week, Anthropic launched its own take on enterprise agents, focused on pre-built plugins for specific departmental functions. And many of the workplace productivity services Trace will be drawing from, like Atlassian’s Jira, are launching their own agents, which will potentially compete with the startup’s system.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Now we’ve moved from prompt engineering to context engineering,” says CTO Artur Romanov. “Whoever provides the best context at the right time is going to be the infrastructure on top of which the AI-first companies will be built. And we hope to be that infrastructure.”"

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. In the same subreddit, AI doms were blasted for being “hollow entertainment,” “dangerous,” and “dystopian.” “It can feel like a checklist,” says San Francisco–based sex educator Amp Somers, who is 36 and switches between dom and sub roles, of the demands an AI dom gives out.\n\nAs debates swirl and intensify, the marketplace has gone boom. Joi AI is one of the many services—along with Character.AI, Replika, and Soulmaite—that let users create and customize chatbots for BDSM role-play. According to the company, which bills itself as an “AI-lationships” platform, and an antidote to dating apps, its “user base has grown five times in 2025 compared to 2024.” Several sex workers, including Alix Lynx and Jenna Starr, have licensed their likeness to Joi (the company declined to share exact user numbers). Developers are also sprinting to create applications for role-play chatbots that are “not just erotic content spam, but something focused on immersive, intelligent conversation with a dominant persona.” Even Oxy shop, an online BDSM gear retailer for sub men who like to wear chastity cages, has started to offer an AI-driven “BDSM chat” for members, which allows them to indulge in all sorts of dominatrix fantasies; “Surrender to Mandy” or “Submit to Mike,” the page advertises.\n\nWatching porn can be a passive experience, but “an AI chatbot allows people a forum to talk about, express, and articulate their sexual fantasies,” says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick whose research focuses on the digital culture of love. “The idea that you can program your domination exactly the way you want. That is one of the fantasies underpinning the relationship between humans and AI—the fact that we can shape and model our partner.”"

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Things Fall Apart Rolling out this week, WIRED’s journalistic commissions on technological decommissions—from broken-down electric cars to falling-down space stations.\n\nAccording to the TOP500, which ranks these mega-machines, Sierra was once the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. She was conceived in a Chicago hotel conference room more than a decade ago, at a technical discussion for officials from America’s national labs. The ultimate designer baby, Sierra was assembled from thousands of IBM Power9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs—a daring, offbeat architecture for Livermore at the time.\n\nLike other supercomputers, Sierra was girthy. She was composed of thousands of compute nodes, stored one on top of another in racks—basically cabinets—that held up her processing innards. She had 240 of these racks, spread across roughly 7,000 square feet. All of this was needed to support her life’s main occupation: performing specialized, super-high-security simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time of her death sentence, her processing power ranked a still-respectable 23rd in the world.\n\nNow, why did Sierra have to die? After all, an enormous amount of time and resources went into Frankensteining her together. The leadership of the lab won’t confirm how much she cost to build, but she was expensive—the government spent at least $325 million on her and her fraternal twin, a supercomputer called Summit at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. (Summit was decommissioned in late 2024.) Also, she still totally worked. “At the end of the life of a machine, you could think, Oh, we have all these sunk costs. You should just keep running the machine forever,” says John Allen, the lab’s organizational information security officer. But that’s wrong. “Its good and faithful service is over, and we have to move on.”"

            "content": "Once the most talked-about TV show in the country, South Park, is on Paramount+. Don’t you want to know what got Trump in such a tizzy?\n\nStream the much buzzed-about South Park, fan-favorite Yellowstone, original series MobLand, and rebooted crime drama Dexter & Dexter on Paramount+. The streaming network has a bingeable TV series for almost everyone. And whether you want to remember Lindsay Lohan’s old face in the classic Mean Girls flick, or wonder just how many more sequels Tom Cruise has left in him with Top Gun: Maverick, there’s a bevy of films to stream, too.\n\nIf you’re like me and have at least half a dozen streaming services, our Paramount+ coupon codes can help you save so you can watch the content you want without having to get rid of one of your other beloved content platforms. (I love pretending the world isn’t full of suffering around me and instead focus on Sylvester Stallone’s ever-changing Play-Doh face in Tulsa King.)\n\nTry Paramount+ Free With a One-Week Trial\n\nIf you’re unsure if you’ll actually want to commit to Paramount+, or if there’s a sports event like March Madness games and you only need to access the content for a little while, Paramount+’s free trial is a great option. The trial lasts one week, is for new subscribers only, and can’t be paired with other offers.\n\nThere are tiered plans, including Essential, which allows for 3 devices, select Showtime series, NFL games, and can be streamed on up to 3 devices at once, but has ads; and Premium, which includes all that except there are no ads, downloadable content, CBS live, and all of Showtime content.\n\nFind the Right Paramount+ Plan Pricing and Get the Latest Deals\n\nIt’s important that you choose the right Paramount+ streaming plan for you so that you can get the best bang for your buck. Lucky for you, all plans come with a 7-day free trial so you can make sure you’re choosing the right plan for you. The first is Paramount+ Essential, which is $8 per month. It has ads included, but you’ll have access to over 40,000 episodes and movies. And you’ll be able to stream on 3 devices at once, be able to watch NFL games on CBS and UEFA Champions League, and select Showtime series are also available. Paramount+ Premium is the next tier (and the most popular choice), which starts at $13 per month (after the free trial ends), and you’ll get everything mentioned in the previous tier, without ads. You’ll have all that as well as the ability to watch in 4K UHD, Dolby Vision or HDR10, downloadable movies and shows, streaming CBS live and all of Showtime’s content library.\n\nCan You Cancel Paramount Plus at any Time?\n\nIf you find the service isn’t right for you, or just need to cut down on subscriptions, you can cancel Paramount+ any time. However, the cancellation process depends on where you signed up. If you signed up directly on the website, you’ll need to go to your account page.\n\nSave on a Paramount+ Subscription With Student and Military Discounts\n\nIf you’re a student now (or have your student ID lying around somewhere), you can get a Paramount+ plan at only $4 a month. All you have to do is verify your student status and you’ll get 50% off any plan of your choosing for the first year. Or if you’re a military member, Paramount+ gives 50% off any subscription for life.\n\nWatch Paramount+ Originals and Fan Favorites\n\nThere’s truly something for everyone in the family, with movies, kids’ shows, and Paramount+ originals included in every plan. If you’re feeling spooky, I’d recommend Dexter: Resurrection, or Yellowjackets, but if you’re looking for something more family-friendly, there’s super popular cartoons like Rango or Sonic the Hedgehog to choose from.\n\nLooking for specific recommendations? I’ve got you. There are tons of great new releases coming to Paramount+ this month, including Landman season 2, new Paramount+ original comedy series Crutch starring Tracy Morgan, and new episodes of (my favorite) newly premiered Ink Master Season 17. There are also tons of new movies, including The Cut, a boxing drama starring Orlando Bloom, dark comedy Shell, and true-crime tale My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story. Plus, Paramount+ will be playing the important NFL holiday games.\n\nCheck out the wide breadth of TV and movie content to choose from on Paramount+ (and use the Paramount+ promo codes above to save on whatever plan you decide).\n\nStream Live Sports and Events on Paramount+\n\nFor better or worse, I’m a Chiefs fan (cue the booing). I usually get a Paramount+ plan during the football season to keep up with my favorite beefy, TBI-ridden men. You can stream all of the NFL coverage you want all season long, plus, 24/7 live channels are now streaming on Paramount+, so you’ll never need to give your brain the time to process the horrors.\n\nStream UFC Fights Live on Paramount+\n\nParamount+ has all the man-on-man action you want, from bloody brawls to KO’s. Paramount+ is your one-stop shop to stream UFC live so you can catch every fight. This includes UFC 326: Holloway vs. Oliveira 2, airing March 7 and UFC Fight Night: Emmett vs. Vallejos, airing March 14.\n\nWatch March Madness With Paramount+\n\nThe annual tournament that determines which men’s and women’s Division I teams will win the NCAA Basketball championships, March Madness, will be streaming on Paramount+ this spring. You can watch any men's March Madness games that are being broadcast on CBS with Paramount+. Let the games begin!\n\nDon’t Miss the Champions League Soccer on Paramount+\n\nIf football (or soccer) is more your jam, Paramount+ also has you covered. You can watch Champions League Soccer at Paramount+, including fan favorites and heated rivalries from Real Madrid, AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Barcelona, and more."

            "content": "At the beginning of the year, The Cut kicked off a brief discourse cycle by declaring a new lifestyle trend: “friction-maxxing.”\n\nThe idea, in a nutshell, is that people have overconvenienced themselves with apps, AI, and other means of near-instant gratification—and would be better off with increased friction in their daily lives, which is to say those mundane challenges that ask some minor effort of them.\n\nWhatever your feelings on that philosophy, the use of “maxxing” as a suffix assumed to be familiar or at least intelligible to most readers of a mainstream news outlet is evidence of another trend: the assimilation of incel terminology across the broader internet. The online ecosystem of incels, or “involuntarily celibate” men, is saturated with this sort of clinical jargon; its aggrieved participants insulate, isolate, and identify themselves through in-group codespeak that is meant to baffle and repel outsiders. So how did non-incels (“normies,” as incels would label them) end up adopting and recontextualizing these loaded words?\n\nSlang, no matter its origins, has a viral nature. It tends to break containment and mutate. The buzzword “woke,” as it pertains to our current politics, comes from African American Vernacular English and once referred to an awareness of racial and social injustice—this usage dates to the middle of the 20th century, preceding even the civil rights movement. But the culture wars of this century have turned “woke” into a favorite pejorative of right-wingers, who wield it as a catchall term for anything that threatens their ideology, such as Black pilots or gender-neutral pronouns.\n\nBack in 2014, the eruption of the Gamergate harassment campaign set the stage for a different linguistic realignment. An organized backlash to women working in the video game industry, and eventually any sort of diversity or progressivism within the medium, it exposed a vein of reactionary anger that would gain a fuller voice during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. This was a period when many in the digital mainstream got their first taste of the trollish nihilism and invective that fuels toxic message boards such as 4chan and gave rise to a network of anti-feminist manosphere sites collectively known as the “PSL” community: PUAHate (a board for venting about pickup artists, it was shut down soon after the 2014 Isla Vista killing spree carried out by Elliot Rodger, who frequented the forum), SlutHate (a straightforward misogyny hub), and Lookism (where incels viciously critique each other’s appearance).\n\nLookism, named for the idea that prejudice against the less attractive is as common and pernicious as sexism or racism, is the only forum of the PSL trifecta that survives today, and while we don’t know who coined the “maxxing” idiom, it’s the likeliest source for the first verb with this construction. “Looksmaxxing,” which borrows from the role-playing game concept of “min-maxing,” or elevating a character’s strengths while limiting weaknesses, became the preferred expression for attempts to improve one’s appearance in pursuit of sex. This could mean something as simple as a style makeover or as extreme as “bonesmashing,” a supposed technique of achieving a more defined jaw by tapping it with a hammer."

            "content": "They're so sleek, no one even thinks to ask if they're smart glasses. Standing up on a stage about to give a talk at a conference in Rust, Germany, I wore the Even Realities G2 glasses to prove a point. In my field of view, a glowing monochrome 3D text display brought up notes on a teleprompter window. I tapped to navigate with a metallic ring on my right forefinger.\n\nAnd like that, my talking points drifted in a slow scroll to match the moments when I mentioned key terms as I improvised.\n\nThis was my first time trying smart glasses with a teleprompter in a real-life situation where I couldn't risk failure. The $599 G2 glasses only half passed the test. While these camera-free smart glasses have the lightweight framing I want, fit my extremely myopic prescription and have battery life to last a full day and then some, they don't work nearly as fluidly as I'd want. Which is why, midway through my live talk, I basically abandoned the teleprompter function and improvised the rest of the way.\n\nSmart glasses right now are like early smartwatches a decade ago, a wild mix of ideas thrown against the wall by an increasing number of companies, mixing features and AI services and interfaces in different combinations. There are no clear standards for smart glasses yet, like there are for phones, earbuds or even watches.\n\nScott Stein/CNET\n\nWhile Meta has stolen most of the spotlight and market with its AI-enabled and chunky Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses, they're not the only forms in the wild. Meta's glasses have cameras and microphones, and onboard speakers, acting as face-worn recording devices. Only one model right now has a display. The Meta Ray-Ban Displays have a single color display in one eye, and they don't have lenses that can be made for my high-index eye prescription. They also have battery life that can't last a full day, or even just a few hours.\n\nEven Realities' glasses are a totally different story. The second-generation models can fit a wide range of prescriptions, even beyond mine (up to +/-12). The battery life lasts well over a day. They have dual, larger displays in monochrome green. And they don't have cameras at all. Or speakers. Just displays and microphones.\n\nI got fitted for a prescription pair to try, thanks to Even, and have been wearing them on and off since the start of the year (prescription lenses cost at least $159 to add to the glasses). I wore them at CES in Las Vegas, and out to a German immersive entertainment conference called Aurea. I've worn them into New York. And I've been trying them along with a separately sold $249 smart ring, the Even R1, that controls the glasses and doubles as a heart rate-measuring fitness tracker.\n\nI love that these glasses are so trim and compact. So discreet. And that they fit my eyes and have amazing battery life. I just wish the rest of it worked as well as it promised. Some AI features are great, but I wish there were more.\n\nThe Even G2 glasses do have a remarkably compact design. Seen next to them: the separately-sold R1 control ring that's also a fitness tracker. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEveryday-looking thin glasses\n\nThe most impressive aspect of the Even G2 is its shockingly lightweight frame and design. I've shown these glasses to people, and they had no idea they were smart glasses. They seem too unimposing.\n\nThe frame, in particular, is the standout. The metal frame around the lenses and arms is thin, with the only bulge in small bulb-like parts at the ends of the arms, where you'll find the batteries and touchpads to control the glasses. The display projectors live inside thicker parts of the arm near the lenses, but again, it's really subtle. The glasses are really lightweight, too: at 35 grams, they feel lighter than my regular glasses.\n\nThe G2s are a particular type of glasses design, though. They're small for my taste, and come in either square or round frames. And after a while, those bulky end bits on the metal arms start making my ears uncomfortable. They charge via an included glasses case that's bulkier than the Meta Ray-Bans case, but connects with USB-C the same way and is easy to tuck in a bag.\n\nThe separately sold R1 ring is an odder duck. It's similar to other smart rings like Oura in that it can track steps and heart rate. But the R1 also has a touch bar on one side that acts like a touchpad to control the Even G2 glasses. Double-tapping wakes the screen, swiping moves you through menus, and pressing and holding moves back a menu level.\n\nMe getting ready to talk on-stage, taking a quick selfie. The Even G2s do feel remarkably lightweight. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nThe ring's meant to be worn on your index finger, resting before the first knuckle so you can comfortably use the touchpad with your thumb, and that can get weird. I'm worried it'll fall off. When I was giving that stage presentation with teleprompter mode, as I held a microphone in one hand and a remote to control the slide deck in the other, it was super-hard to click the ring.\n\nLuckily, the glasses have their own touchpad controls, one at the back of each arm. They're often covered with my hair at the back of my ears, but they can navigate more reliably. Then you don't need to get the ring.\n\nAnd sometimes, the ring just stops working. A big problem with both the glasses and the ring is their spotty connectivity, even with multiple firmware updates. Sometimes it feels like a Bluetooth issue. Other times, I wonder if the background connection the glasses forge with my iPhone ends up timing out. Right now, in fact, the ring just stopped functioning as a touch control for some reason. And sometimes the glasses don't auto-dim the green micro LED display, keeping it on far longer than I need and getting in the way of my vision.\n\nThe micro LED display is big and bright enough indoors and in dimmer light, but it gets washed out in bright daylight. It's 3D and shows up across both eyes, looking like panels of green text overlaid on top of the transparent lenses. The small waveguide patches on each lens are subtle but do show up in light, and sometimes the displays can be seen through the lenses, too.\n\nBut the displays are clever, because they fade away when you're not looking at them. It's a bit of peripheral-vision magic because the green displays appear when you look up. But looking down at the rest of my world, like when typing this review, they seem to fade away.\n\nI'd skip the ring and just get the glasses, but even then, I don't think I'd want the glasses in their current software form. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nAI: Bits and pieces\n\nI love that Even Realities' onboard software has a unique application to use AI with, a mode called Conversate. However, it's one of the only useful AI features on the glasses for me.\n\nConversate is a live mode that auto-transcribes a conversation (or whatever you're listening to), displaying the text on-screen as captions while also listening for random key phrases the AI considers noteworthy. Those get pulled out into another pop-up window that defines the term loosely. For instance, as I listened to a presentation on virtual worlds, the term \"biomimicry\" was defined for me on-glasses. When would I get another phrase pulled out? I had no idea.\n\nI used the Even G2 glasses in Conversate mode for most of a whole day, listening to other keynote presentations, and was able to save the transcripts into the Even Realities phone app. None of this used much of the glasses' battery life, impressively, and the onboard microphones had no problem picking up audio from across the room.\n\nThe transcripts include AI summaries and key-term breakdowns, which is helpful. I can also look over the pulled-out terms of note that got defined during Conversate mode. I kind of fell in love with keeping these on as a helpful listening partner, but not having control over Conversate's focus on particular phrases to define wasn't great.\n\nBut it made me wonder about a future where talking with people could generate helpful information to guide me, via subtle pop-up prompts. Even's Conversate mode is a stab in that direction, but crudely. I can't choose other AI services to run on the glasses, just the company's own Even AI, which doesn't clearly list what models it uses to function.\n\nThere's also a dedicated Even AI mode that responds to voice prompts, but it's worse than anything you'd use on your phone. It sometimes answers in a strange way and with less detail than ChatGPT and Gemini. It also relies on relatively limited display screen real estate to show answers, so it's basically a one-question-at-a-time experience. The text replies also roll in pretty slowly for my comfort.\n\nA look at the other side of the lens: the thicker arm part is where the display lives. A small patch on-lens is where the display gets reflected onto, Scott Stein/CNET\n\nEven Realities has an on-glasses maps-based navigation mode called Navigate that provides pop-up turn-by-turn directions. Not having any of these modes hook into existing phone apps or services is a huge downside, though. I have to ask for things from scratch and hope Even AI delivers.\n\nOn-glasses translation can handle 35 languages, far more than Meta's glasses can do. There's no need to download language packs either, but you do have to select the language pairs from the phone app to make it work. Oddly, you can't do it in glasses.\n\nTeleprompter mode is one of my other favorites, and maybe the best next to Conversate. You can cut and paste notes or speeches into the app and then roll them on glasses. It listens in and keeps up with what you're saying, even skipping ahead if you're at a later point. While this worked well generally, in a live stage experience, I couldn't control the ring well enough to get the teleprompter to start up. I had nervous jitters, combined with a less-than-responsive ring touchpad.\n\nAnd that's about it for the Even's features. Seriously. I'm struggling to think of what else I'd even use these glasses for, which is why I'm usually taking them back off again.\n\nThey're not even a good replacement for a smartwatch. Notifications can appear in-glasses, but many still don't pop up for me when paired with an iPhone. Incoming calls don't show up either. I can't respond to texts (or apparently see them). On Meta's Ray-Bans, I can at least answer calls and use the glasses like AirPods. You can't do that on Even's glasses. You can't listen to music. And you can't use them as cameras, because there aren't any.\n\nThe good news is that there are apparently a number of developers working on AI apps for the glasses that could emerge soon. These glasses are trying to be the Pebble watch of smart glasses in that respect. But I need those features and the customization to hurry up and get here. Right now, there's not enough to do to justify wearing them.\n\nThe right form, the wrong function\n\nI've come away from my Even G2 test drive realizing that, yes, smart glasses can be as small and prescription-friendly (and battery life-friendly) as my dreams desire. But that comes at a severe cost to everything else. Phones just don't work well with smart glasses right now, no matter what company makes them. The G2 tries, but its wonky phone app, buggy connectivity, limited customization and lack of deeper phone hook-ins to its AI (and lack of support for other AI services) keep it feeling a step behind.\n\nI can't wait for glasses to actually feel like truly deeper phone extensions, things that could assist people on the terms they choose with the apps they want. Meta hasn't gotten there. Even Realities hasn't. Maybe Google will, with its glasses coming later this year.\n\nI hope other smart glasses have the battery life, prescription lens support and size advantages Even does. It's sorely needed. It's just extremely disappointing that these glasses can't live up to the promise of all the rest yet. I'll check back later if more apps come, and see if they can be the Pebble for my face I was hoping for."

            "content": "Space heaters give a jolt of warmth to chilly corners of your home. They can even cut your heating bill during the cold season when used strategically in place of whole-house heat.\n\nHowever, these portable warmers can also cause problems, especially when used improperly or in the wrong locations.\n\nSpace heaters are a leading cause of home fires in the US during the winter months, yet many of these fires are preventable with proper placement. It's critical to keep an eye on your space heater while it's on and never leave it running without supervision. It's also important to avoid placing them in areas that increase fire risk.\n\nFor a safe, warm winter, here are nine places your space heater should never be.\n\n\n\nSpace heaters, even those with tip-over safeguards, don't belong on rugs. Getty Images\n\n1. On a carpet, rug or flammable surface\n\nSpace heaters can't sit on any surface that can easily scorch or catch on fire. That means you can never place one on a carpet or rug. You should also avoid using them on more delicate hardwoods or meltable vinyl, especially for long periods.\n\nWhat if you have only carpet in a cold room? You can look for a ceramic or otherwise heatproof base to position under the heater. It must be larger than the heater itself by about 3 inches on all sides.\n\n2. Near walls and furniture\n\nYour space heater needs a safety zone: Keep it at least 3 feet away from any walls or furniture to avoid burning hazards. Unfortunately, this also means that under your desk or dining table is a no-go. Try aiming space heaters toward these areas instead of placing them directly under them.\n\n3. Near blankets, pillows or curtains\n\nSpace heaters become an even greater fire risk if someone accidentally puts a blanket or pillow against them -- and in winter, that can easily happen. The same is true if the heater is pushed against any hanging curtains. Keep all these flammable items at least 3 feet away from the heater at all times.\n\nKeep space heaters away from everyday objects to play it safe. Cris Cantón/Getty Images\n\n4. Anywhere easily accessed by pets or small children\n\nSpace heaters can easily burn the unwary, and while many newer models have automatic shut-offs if they're tipped over, a fallen space heater can still be a serious fire hazard. Also, pets and kids may not pay attention to where they put toys or blankets, which can create additional risks.\n\nUse space heaters in areas that very young children and larger pets can't access or rarely visit. When they're paying attention, teach them to give the heater a wide berth.\n\n5. Bathrooms and laundry rooms\n\nSpace heaters play poorly around water, which can affect operation and greatly increase the risk of electrical shock. They are also more at risk of tipping over in these environments.\n\nUnfortunately, bathrooms and laundry rooms frequently suffer from brrr-level temperatures if heating is lacking. We suggest positioning a heater outside these rooms for maximum effect and safety.\n\nStaying near a space heater is fine, but always check that it's not overloading your system. Getty Images\n\n6. Plugged in alongside a lot of other appliances or lights\n\nSpace heaters are a big drain on the amps an electrical circuit uses. That's usually fine for newer 15-amp home outlets, since modern space heaters are designed to work with them. The circuit and breaker that manage that room/area have their limits.\n\nPlugging in a space heater along with a bunch of other appliances (kitchen appliances, big entertainment systems, etc.) can overload the system. At best, the breaker flips, and power cuts out. At worst, it overheats wiring and causes an electrical fire.\n\n\n\nThis overload risk is also more common in colder months because the holidays often lead to plugging in more light-up decorations, which further increases amp loads on home circuits. You can help mitigate problems by alternating devices to reduce overall power consumption and by monitoring with smart plugs.\n\n7. Plugged into an extension cord or power strip (or both)\n\nExtension cords and power strips aren't necessarily rated for the power space heaters require, and can increase the risk of an electrical fire, even if the outlet and breaker can handle the heater. Plugging an extension cord into a power strip before connecting the heater only increases the danger.\n\nIf you badly need a heater in an out-of-the-way location, look for a model that comes with a wireless power cable. Some extension cords are designed to support higher-amperage appliances, but you must be very careful when matching them to a heater -- we'd rather you avoid it altogether.\n\nWatch where you plug in a heater before warming those toes. Evgen Prozhyrko/Getty Images\n\n8. Plugged into an old or non-GFCI outlet\n\nA ground fault circuit interrupter is a handy bit of technology that shuts down an outlet if there's a problem with its electrical current, especially if it could complete a circuit elsewhere. It's a useful protection against shocks, overheating appliances and other issues. Always make sure that your space heater is plugged into a GFCI outlet.\n\nLikewise, avoid plugging the heater into an especially old outlet or one that's had problems before, such as suddenly not working. This raises the risk of causing wiring damage and resulting fires.\n\n9. Near anyone who gets winter allergies\n\nSpace heaters aren't always a great mix with allergy sufferers. Grace Cary/Getty Images\n\nWinter allergies are often caused by dust, dust mites and particles that accumulate during the closed-up winter days. Those kinds of allergies don't do too well if a device is blowing hot air around a room. That's particularly true if a heater or room hasn't been cleaned recently and there's a lot of built-up dust that can be spread around. If someone has particularly sensitive allergies, try to avoid using the space heater near them and see if you can find other ways to warm up.\n\nFinal tip: Never use fuel heaters inside\n\nOnly use electric or radiant heaters inside. Never use heaters that require fuel, such as kerosene, propane or other gas, in indoor spaces -- including the garage.\n\nFuel will always produce exhaust fumes, and those fumes need a dedicated vent to escape the home (as a gas fireplace does). Without venting fumes, those heaters will fill enclosed spaces with carbon monoxide, which could lead to carbon dioxide poisoning, the worst of news. The exception is certain oil-filled heaters that don't actually combust the oil, but these are relatively rare.\n\n\n\nRemember, if you're heading out or going to bed, remember to turn off the space heater -- never leave it on and unattended inside your home.

            "content": "Samsung just supercharged one of its most-used AI features on the new Galaxy S26 lineup, and it's even more impressive than before.\n\nCircle to Search, which first appeared on the Galaxy S24 phones and then expanded to other devices as Google Lens, felt like magic: Circle anything on your screen and get instant results. The AI-powered visual search tool can identify objects, translate text and surface contextual results without ever leaving the app you're on.\n\nNow it's gotten even smarter.\n\nAndroid's Circle to Search feature originally launched on Samsung Galaxy S24 and Pixel 8 phones in January 2024. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nInstead of just identifying a single item, it can recognize and surface information about multiple things you've presented it with, including an entire outfit. The feature can be used for just about everything, from identifying bird species to translating text, but Samsung says fashion and shopping are hands-down the most popular use case.\n\nSo of course I had to put it to the test at Samsung's Unpacked event in San Francisco by having it scan my outfit -- and I was genuinely floored. In the crowded event space under harsh lighting, I was skeptical it could deliver. It did.\n\nFirst, it pulled up an AI summary describing the scene: \"The look features a vibrant blue structured blazer, white top, dark fitted leggings and classic black leather boots.\" Right below that, I pressed the \"Find the look\" button and watched it do its magic.\n\nWithin seconds, I was staring at the exact same in-your-face cerulean blazer I was wearing, with a link to the online store I'd bought it from, along with a slew of strikingly similar shopping options ranging from upscale alternatives to budget-friendly picks. As someone who regularly looks to TV shows, movies and red carpet events for outfit inspo, this level of stalking would've taken me at least 20 minutes to lock down.\n\nScrolling down revealed the same for my glossy black leggings. Despite being from many seasons ago and not available anymore, it returned convincing dupes from different retailers. It did the same for my decade-old knee-high boots and even pulled up a used pair from Postmark; a nod at the fact that mine are old AF. The only thing it failed to surface was the shirt I was wearing under the blazer that was clearly visible in the shot. Maybe layers is the next frontier for Circle to Search.\n\nSurprisingly, the hardest part of the process was figuring out how to use the feature. I had to ask a Samsung employee to take a full-body picture of me. Once I had it on the screen, I long-pressed on the home button at the bottom of the screen, which triggered a Google overlay. I then had to circle myself from head to toe. It's the kind of feature I'd program on an action button if I could -- although my wallet would likely suffer the consequences.\n\nIn doing this, Samsung and Google have virtually removed the friction between liking someone's outfit, and pressing the trigger on buying it. It wasn't that long ago that the closest alternative involved screenshotting a look, posting it to Pinterest and attempting to track down similar pieces. This is faster, cleaner and almost dangerously good for fashion lovers like me.\n\nIf this gets any better, Samsung may need to add a few guardrails for those of us prone to a little too much impulse shopping."

            "content": "It seems like Netflix's presence at award shows gets bigger every year, and now that the 2026 Academy Award nominations are out, that presence continues to grow. Six Netflix original films earned 18 nominations this year, including nods for Train Dreams and Frankenstein in the Best Picture category, Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song for KPop Demon Hunters, and Best Documentary Feature for The Perfect Neighbor. The streaming giant's combination of original films and a diverse library of films from other production houses makes it a reliable source of entertainment, although it can sometimes be hard to narrow down what to watch.\n\nWhile Blue Moon isn't a Netflix original, it has been nominated for two Oscars this year and it's currently streaming on the platform, making it the perfect opportunity to catch it before this year's ceremony on Sunday, March 15. Set in 1943, the film stars Ethan Hawke as the real-life songwriter and lyricist Lorenz Hart, whose partnership with Richard Rodgers has crumbled. Hart has to witness the success and glory that Rodgers and his new partner, Oscar Hammerstein, are experiencing with their new musical, Oklahoma! and it's bittersweet to say the least. The period drama is one of Hawke's best performances.\n\nIf you'd rather go with a series, peruse our picks for the best TV shows to watch on Netflix.\n\n\n\nWatch movies at Netflix\n\nSony Pictures Classics Blue Moon (2025) Blue Moon was released in theaters in 2025 and it's currently nominated for two Oscars, one for Ethan Hawke's lead performance as songwriter Lorenz Hart and another for Best Original Screenplay. In the film, a depressed Hart struggles to accept the success of his former songwriting partner Richard Rodgers (played by Andrew Scott). Bobby Cannavale and Margaret Qualley also co-star. The film, directed by Richard Linklater, marks his ninth film collaboration with Hawke.\n\nWarner Bros. Best in Show (2000) Christopher Guest directed Best in Show, a mockumentary about people entering the prestigious Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show. The largely improvised movie features an ensemble of actors who appear often in Guest's films: Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean and, of course, Catherine O'Hara. (The movie is so beloved that O'Hara, who died on Jan. 30, was actually honored with a tribute at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show on Feb. 3.)\n\nSony Pictures Casino Royale (2006) The debate over which actor is the best James Bond has existed for decades but you can decide for yourself who's the superior 007 now that Netflix has dropped 25 James Bond movies from every era, including Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, No Time To Die and Casino Royale. (We've suggested Casino Royale here because if you like a modern action film, Daniel Craig's version of Bond, especially in Casino Royale, has it all: excitement, romance, glamour, high stakes card games... The film truly revived the franchise. Hot take alert!)\n\nNetflix The Perfect Neighbor (2025) Directed and produced by Geeta Gandbhir, The Perfect Neighbor is a harrowing documentary about the killing of Ajike Owens, a Florida woman who was shot to death on June 2, 2023, by her neighbor, Susan Louise Lorincz. The film's use of police body camera footage and 911 calls lay out the neighborhood disputes stemming from Lorincz's erratic and unsettling behavior and the escalating tension that led to the killing.\n\nNetflix KPop Demon Hunters (2025) The Netflix original animated film KPop Demon Hunters premiered in June and quickly rose through the ranks to become the platform's most-watched original film of all time. The film, about a KPop group that performs by day and hunts demons in their downtime, has a soundtrack that's already been certified Platinum thanks to hits like \"Golden\" and \"Soda Pop.\" The film stars Arden Cho, May Hong and Ji Young Yoo as the titular girl group tasked with fighting off a demonic boy band. (Can't get enough of the movie? Check out the theatrical sing-along version and lyric videos that are also available to stream.) The film was also honored with two Golden Globes this year for Best Original Song and Best Animated Motion Picture and nabbed two Oscar nods.\n\nSony Pictures Animation Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the first animated Spider-Man feature in the Marvel canon, and the film follows Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as he becomes the new Spider-Man and teams up with other Spider-People from various parallel universes to save his universe from the Kingpin (voiced by Liev Schreiber). The film's other Spider-Men are played by Jake Johnson, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn and Nicolas Cage. Tthe rest of the cast is top-notch, too.\n\nStand By Me (1986) Stand By Me, based on a novella by Stephen King and directed by Rob Reiner, is a coming-of-age story about four 12-year-old boys (played by River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell and Corey Feldman) who hear about a dead body on the outskirts of town and go on an adventure to find it. The film earned an Academy Award nomination and has often been lauded as a classic, timeless coming-of-age story. The film will be available to stream on Netflix until Feb. 28.\n\nNetflix Jay Kelly (2025) George Clooney and Adam Sandler received Golden Globe nominations for their performances in Noah Baumbach's Jay Kelly, which arrived on Netflix this December. Clooney stars as the title character, a movie star grappling with his age, career and relationships during a trip to Europe.\n\nUniversal Pictures The Sting (1973) The 1973 Oscar-winner The Sting stars Robert Redford and Paul Newman, who reunite with director George Roy Hill, with whom they previously collaborated on the wildly successful Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. In The Sting, Redford and Newman are two grifters who plot to con a mob boss, played by Robert Shaw. Set amid the Great Depression, with a ragtime score from Marvin Hamlisch, the film is a memorable classic.\n\nNext Entertainment World Train To Busan (2016) In the great horror thriller Train to Busan, a father finds himself trapped on a train from Seoul to Busan that's filled with zombies. As he tries to protect his daughter and escape from the infected, the film delivers pulse-pounding thrills and has been lauded as one of the best zombie movies of the past few years.\n\nParamount Pictures The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) A couple of years ago, Netflix had a huge hit with its stylish series Ripley, which starred Andrew Scott as suave con artist Tom Ripley. Before that series, there was the critically acclaimed 1999 film version, The Talented Mr. Ripley, also based on Patricia Highsmith's story. In the film, also out on Netflix now (so you can compare and contrast the performances!), Matt Damon plays the amoral, ruthless Ripley, who cons his way into the lives of a wealthy group of friends using fake identities. The ruse eventually turns deadly once they catch on to his crime. Catch the star-studded movie before it leaves the platform on March 12.\n\nNetflix Frankenstein (2025) Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein received five Golden Globe nominations this year and nine Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor for Jacob Elordi. The film, a reimagining of the Mary Shelley classic, is pure del Toro, filled with the dark, fantastical style the director is known for.\n\nA24 Priscilla (2023) Sofia Coppola directed the 2023 biopic Priscilla, which is about the life of a young Priscilla Presley who was just a teen when she met her future husband, Elvis Presley. Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi portray the volatile couple in this Golden Globe-nominated film. If you're a fan of their performances, they also appear in two other Netflix originals on our list -- Spaeny co-stars in Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery, and Elordi plays the creature in Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein.\n\nNetflix Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery (2025) Daniel Craig returns for a third time as Benoit Blanc in the newest film in the Knives Out mystery series, Wake Up Dead Man. This time around, the charming detective has been summoned to a small town in New York to investigate the death of a monsignor at a small church, and everyone in the sprawling A-list ensemble is a suspect. The film co-stars Glenn Close, Andrew Scott, Josh O'Connor, Mila Kunis, Kerry Washington and others. Why not make it a double feature and watch 2022's Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, also on Netflix, while you're at it?\n\nNetflix Train Dreams (2025) Joel Edgerton stars in Train Dreams, an Oscar-nominated drama that has won awards at several film festivals and the Independent Spirit Awards this year. The film takes place roughly a century ago; Edgerton stars as Robert Grainier, a logger in the Pacific Northwest struggling to build a life for himself and his family. The story is adapted from the novella of the same name by Denis Johnson and costars Felicity Jones, Kerry Condon and William H. Macy.\n\nToho Godzilla Minus One (2023) Godzilla Minus One is an Academy Award-winning Japanese-language movie written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki. Set in 1945, the story centers around Kōichi Shikishima, a young pilot dealing with PTSD in a post-World War II era. After surviving an encounter with Godzilla, he and others realize the kaiju is gearing up to attack Tokyo. A sequel to the Sony film has also just been announced; Godzilla Minus Zero is expected in theaters in late 2026. Watch Godzilla Minus One on Netflix\n\nMandarin Films Ip Man (2008) Ip Man is one of the most iconic martial arts film franchises of the past two decades. Starring Hong Kong martial arts master Donnie Yen (maybe you recognize him as Caine, the blind assassin in John Wick: Chapter 4), Ip Man and its sequels are the biographical films about the life of Yip Man, the kung fu master who famously taught Bruce Lee. Blending biography, drama and action all together, Ip Man and its three sequels have been critically acclaimed and are beloved entries to Hong Kong cinema. All four films arrived to Netflix in October.\n\nSearchlight Pictures 28 Years Later (2025) 28 Years Later is the third film in the zombie series about a viral outbreak that has ravaged England and placed it under quarantine with almost no contact with the rest of the world. Though the first film, 2002's 28 Days Later, just left Netflix, you can still catch 28 Years Later, about a young boy who ventures away from the safety of his village and has his first encounter with \"the infected.\" It's expected that the fourth film in the franchise, the recently released 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, will drop on the platform at some point this year, too.\n\nSummit Entertainment The Hurt Locker (2008) Released in 2008, The Hurt Locker won six Academy Awards, including those for Best Picture and Best Director (Kathryn Bigelow was the first woman ever to receive the award). The film, which co-stars Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty and Ralph Fiennes, follows a team of soldiers who defuse and dispose of explosives while deployed in Iraq. The film was critically lauded for its depiction of the stress and psychological toll of war.\n\nNetflix Rebel Ridge (2024) Netflix original Rebel Ridge snagged an Emmy this year for Best Television Movie. The action film stars Aaron Pierre as an ex-Marine who, in an attempt to post bail for his cousin, has the bail money stolen by corrupt cops, and the ordeal turns into an action-packed, thrilling showdown. Don Johnson has evolved from playing suave cops like Sonny Crockett in Miami Vice to morally compromised officers of the law these days, and in Rebel Ridge, he's earned accolades for playing a wickedly corrupt Louisiana police chief at the heart of the film.\n\nNetflix The Old Guard (2020) Based on the comic book by Greg Rucka, the action-fantasy The Old Guard stars Charlize Theron as one of a group of immortal mercenaries who are able to regenerate even after being killed. When they're tracked down and hunted by a pharmaceutical company that intends to study them, they fight back in an effort to protect themselves. The first film, released in 2020, was such a success that a sequel, The Old Guard 2, premiered in 2025 with Uma Thurman cast as Theron's newest adversary.\n\nSony Pictures One of Them Days (2025) One of Them Days is pure comedy gold. It's the perfect (R-rated) film when you're looking for something silly and fun and packed with great jokes and performances. The movie is part of the \"desperate best friends embark on a mission with a deadline\" genre (see also: Booksmart, Plan B) as best friends Dreux (Kiki Palmer) and Alyssa (SZA in her film debut) try to track down the rent money that was stolen by Alyssa's boyfriend before the end of the day. When they realize the money is gone, they desperately try to make all the money they need in one day, leading them to sell a pair of stolen Jordans and stage an art show to sell some of Alyssa's paintings. The film, which arrived on Netflix in March, features hilarious cameos from Katt Williams, Janelle James and Lil Rel Howery. Rumor has it a sequel is in the works.\n\nYoo Eun Mi/Netflix Ballerina (2023) Netflix's K-drama collection has a few hidden gems, including Ballerina, a 2023 revenge story about a former bodyguard seeking justice for her friend. Jang Ok-ju stops at nothing to make the offenders pay in this action-packed thriller. (Just don't get this Ballerina confused with the recent release of the same name starring Ana de Armas, which is also an action-packed revenge story -- that one's not on Netflix, at least not yet.)\n\nLewis Jacobs/Netflix Rez Ball (2024) A powerful story about a high school basketball team in New Mexico, Rez Ball takes viewers on a journey with the Chuska Warriors. When a tragic event strikes the team, it faces challenges on and off the court -- but still aims for a championship title. Co-written by Sydney Freeland and Sterlin Harjo (co-creator of Reservation Dogs), the movie is based on the novel Canyon Dreams: A Basketball Season on the Navajo Nation.\n\nNetflix Hit Man (2024) The 2024 action comedy was one of several movies starring Glen Powell that helped cement his leading-man status. The film, co-written by Powell and director Richard Linklater, stars Powell as a nerdy professor drawn into an undercover investigation. Disguising himself as a hitman, he adopts a new persona for each client -- until he falls for a woman (Adria Arjona) who hires him to kill her abusive husband.\n\nNetflix My Octopus Teacher (2020) 2020's My Octopus Teacher won an Oscar for best documentary feature for telling a personal and poignant story of the friendship between a man and an octopus he meets while diving. Filmed over the course of a year, Craig Foster documented the kinship he formed with the octopus who would repeatedly and playfully approach him. The film explores the often unseen personality of a creature found in the wild who ends up giving Foster insight into nature and his own relationships. If you're inspired by the natural world, the film's director Pippa Ehrlich's follow-up feature, Pangolin: Kulu's Journey, is on Netflix now, too.\n\nNetflix The Only Girl In The Orchestra (2024) The Only Girl in the Orchestra won an Oscar in 2025 for best documentary short and you can catch the 35-minute film exclusively on Netflix. The film is the story of Orin O'Brien, the first woman hired to perform in the New York Philharmonic (by Leonard Bernstein, no less). Often ogled for her looks and singled out for attention because of her gender, she rose above it all, staying true to her creative principles to become one of the orchestra's most renowned musicians for decades. Watch The Only Girl in the Orchestra on Netflix\n\nNetflix 1917 (2019) The critically lauded Oscar-winning film, 1917, directed by Sam Mendes about World War I, was remarkable for the fact that it was filmed with the intent of making it appear as though the entire movie was shot as two long, continuous takes. The movie stars George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman playing British soldiers traveling across a dangerous battle zone rigged by Germans in an effort to deliver a message to their superiors warning them of an impending attack. The film's stellar supporting cast includes Andrew Scott, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Strong and Richard Madden.\n\nNetflix Ma Rainey's Black Bottom (2020) Ma Rainey's Black Bottom is dedicated to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, who made his final screen appearance in the film before his death in 2020. The film stars Boseman as Levee Green, a member of blues singer Ma Rainey's band (Viola Davis), and takes place amid one of the band's conflict-ridden and turbulent recording sessions in 1920s Chicago. Taylour Paige, Colman Domingo and Glynn Turman co-star in the film that was adapted from August Wilson's 1982 play. Watch Ma Rainey's Black Bottom on Netflix\n\nNetflix His Three Daughters (2024) Genre: Drama\n\nRating: R In His Three Daughters, Carrie Coon, Natasha Lyonne and Elizabeth Olsen star as three estranged sisters who come together in their dying father's small New York apartment to care for him in his last days. Writer-director Azazel Jacobs coaxes some incredible performances out of each actress for this intimate, emotional and often funny study of family dynamics. Watch His Three Daughters on Netflix\n\nNetflix Rustin (2023) Colman Domingo earned an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin in this film about a man whose legacy has often been overlooked in civil rights history. Bayard Rustin fought alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and helped organize the 1963 March on Washington and the Freedom Rides, among other major historic events. Rustin's outspoken activism and homosexuality made him a target -- not just for political adversaries but sometimes even among his allies. The film explores the life of a man whose legacy has long been overlooked. Watch Rustin on Netflix\n\nNetflix Maestro (2023) This biographical film nabbed seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.

In 1972, a rugby team from Uruguay boarded a plane to Chile for a game. The plane crashed in the Andes mountains, leaving survivors to contend with injuries, illness, cold temperatures and death. Not everyone makes it and those facing death make agonizing choices to live. Watch Society of the Snow on Netflix\n\nNetflix The Greatest Night in Pop (2024) If you weren't around at the time, it's hard to explain just how huge We Are the World was. Recorded by a supergroup of popular musicians -- assembled on the fly on the night of the 1985 American Music Awards -- the charity single benefiting Ethiopian famine victims sold more than 20 million copies and featured the likes of Michael Jackson, Lionel Richie, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Diana Ross. (It feels impossible to imagine so many megastars assembling in one room for something like this today.) Luckily for us, there were cameras rolling the entire time as dozens of the world's most famous musicians pulled the epic all-night recording session. The recently departed Quincy Jones proves to be the night's true star, wrangling a studio full of nerves, egos and a little too much wine to produce something genuinely special. Watch The Greatest Night in Pop on Netflix\n\nNetflix Leave the World Behind (2023) An absorbingly unsettling psychological thriller, Leave the World Behind chronicles the strange events that arise during a family's getaway at an opulent rental home.

Watch The Swimmers on Netflix\n\nNetflix All Quiet on the Western Front (2022) A World War I drama based on the classic novel of the same name, this epic depicts the horrors of war through the eyes of 17-year-old German soldier Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer). At first enthused about joining the army, in spite of his parents' wishes, Bäumer gets a violent wake-up call. All Quiet on the Western Front was a dominating force at the 95th Annual Academy Awards, as it was nominated for nine Oscars and ultimately walked away with four, including best international feature film.

It promises to make piano lessons fun by using an iPad app paired with Roli's Piano -- a 49-key midi controller -- along with the Airwave, an instrument and controller that uses camera sensors to track your hand movements.\n\nIn this episode of Prove It, embedded above, I go through the process of teaching myself with a high-tech musical system.\n\nThis isn't just one device -- it's multiple machines coming together to be your teacher.\n\nAt the center is the Roli Piano, a $599 midi controller with keys that light up like a Simon memory game. It has one port for your sustain or expression pedal, and it has an USB-C port for charging and data transfer. You can also connect the piano to your phone or tablet with Bluetooth and access the ROLI Learn app.\n\nBecause it's a midi controller and not a standalone keyboard, it doesn't have a headphone jack or output for an instrument cable on the piano; its sound comes through whatever device you have it connected to. And if you connect it to your phone via Bluetooth and connect your phone to Bluetooth headphones or a speaker, you will notice latency between the time you strike a key and the time you hear the note.\n\nThe Airwave retails for $349 and is a new type of instrument Roli calls an \"expressive controller.\" It has two USB-C ports for charging and data, a pedal input, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It magnetically connects to your Roli Piano and uses USB-C to sync with the Roli Learn app on compatible iPads.\n\nBut the real draw of the Airwave is in the infrared cameras it uses to track your hand movements at a rate of 90 frames per second using something called Vision Technology. These cameras track your hands in real time, and the Airwave creates an animated version of them on screen. This allows the Roli Learn app to help correct your hand posture and it color-codes your fingers to match the color of the keys that you should play with them. If you're an experienced piano player, you can use the Airwave to create some seriously cool musical effects, like layering in multiple sounds with just a wave of your wrist.\n\nThe Roli Learn app ($14.99 a month) is so much fun to use. It combines YouTube-style video tutorials with an interactive interface that looks and feels a lot like Guitar Hero. The introductory courses are really easy to follow -- anyone could do it. (My colleague Bridget Carey says her 6-year-old enjoys using the included games to learn how to play.)\n\nI really appreciate the diversity of human instructors in the video lessons and love that the app features popular music, like Sabrina Carpenter's \"Espresso\" and MGMT's \"Kids,\" in addition to piano classics and skill exercises.\n\nIf you wanted to get started with Roli, there are cheaper ways in, such as using the iPhone app with the smaller Roli Piano M model for $249 -- and you can add on from there.\n\nMy biggest issues when learning a new instrument are finding ways to keep it fun and staying motivated to practice. And after playing with the Roli Piano Learning System for a month, I think I could actually become a decent pianist by learning this way.\n\nWatch this episode of Prove It as I put it to the test, and see if it's something that would work for you."

            "content": "We rely on tech too much. If you're like me, you're online for most of the day, from the first morning scroll on social media to the blur of work emails and direct messages. Having access to our devices can make us feel productive and in control. But there's a hidden cost to being permanently plugged in.\n\nCNET's TechPulse survey found that most US adults (67%) say one tech setback is enough to derail their lives, such as an app crash, a cracked screen or a network outage. Anna Gragert, CNET's wellness editor, isn't surprised.\n\n\"Tech companies want us to buy their products. They want us to scroll. They want us to see the ads and use the products,\" Gragert says. \"So it's no one's fault that they use technology in a way where a single glitch can derail their life.\"\n\nYou don't have to let tech rule your world. Gragert shared a few tips to help cut back on your screen time and break the cycle. Here's what you can do to become less tethered to being online.\n\nKey takeaways Almost 7 in 10 (67%) US adults say a single tech glitch can derail their life.\n\nUS adults say a single tech glitch can derail their life. Most US adults feel productive (58%) , in control (46%) or happy (45%) when tech runs smoothly. Other feelings include connected, relaxed and calm.\n\n, in control or happy when tech runs smoothly. Other feelings include connected, relaxed and calm. Disconnecting from tech improves over half (56%) of US adults' moods. Yet, 44% feel in control and powerful when they stay connected to their devices.\n\nof US adults' moods. Yet, feel in control and powerful when they stay connected to their devices. Experts recommend setting screen time limits using apps, adjusting your phone settings, and following other wellness tips.\n\nMany US adults feel 'in control' with tech, but that's concerning\n\nOur CNET survey found that despite nearly 70% of US adults saying their lives are derailed by a glitch, 46% of US adults have a sense of control when tech is running smoothly.\n\nCole Kan/CNET\n\nGragert pointed out that human beings are wired for control, craving the ability to map out the unknown and seek the comfort of predictability. \"We want to have control over our lives and what's going to happen to us. But we can't,\" Gragert says.\n\nUsing technology to pay our bills, map our commutes and call our friends can make us feel like we're winning at productivity and that our personal assistants are successfully connecting us to the real world. But that constant reliance on technology can be a double-edged sword, especially when it comes to social media.\n\nGragert says we cannot curate our emotions as easily as we curate our feeds. Social media algorithms often take away our ability to regulate our emotions while scrolling. For example, doomscrolling can turn into emotional turmoil when a triggering post catches us off guard. That proves that when we're online, we're at the mercy of our algorithm.\n\n\"What appears on our feeds can be triggering or can give us imposter syndrome, make us feel left out, and make us feel like we're not good enough,\" Gragert says. And when kids and teens stay connected to tech, they can be exposed to inappropriate content and cyberbullying.\n\nUS adults are nearly split on how it feels to disconnect from tech\n\nOne shocking find is how US adults are nearly split on how they feel when connected versus disconnected from technology.\n\nOver half (56%) of US adults say their mood improves when disconnecting from tech, whereas 44% feel powerful and in control when they're constantly connected. Both datapoints make sense to Gragert because how we use social media is a journey.\n\nCole Kan/CNET\n\nInitially, you may feel good about your social media intake because of ads based on your interests and fun posts you see. However, it can turn into a dangerous cycle as you spend more time online, Gragert says.\n\nYou may notice your mood shift when you see a negative headline or a reel that triggers imposter syndrome. Over time, you may not feel as productive or present in your day to day if you spend hours on your phone.\n\n56% of US adults may already have experienced a journey similar to this example, so they may feel better disconnected, Gragert adds. On the other hand, 44% may be at the start of the journey of feeling happy online, and may not have experienced many of those negative feelings, such as depression, anxiety or procrastination.\n\nHow to cut your screen time without giving up your favorite tech\n\nThere are plenty of ways you can lower your screen time, but your method depends on what works best for you. For instance, I've tried putting my phone in another room, but I've found that using my phone's settings to block apps while working or during family time works best. Here are a few methods that Gragert recommends trying.\n\nFollow the 20-20-20 rule\n\nThe 20-20-20 rule can protect your eye health and serve as a starting point for cutting back on screen time, whether you're working on your laptop or doomscrolling. \"When you've been scrolling or on your computer for 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Then repeat,\" Gragert says.\n\nAs you get comfortable following this rule, you may increase the time you spend away from your phone. For example, starting with two minutes to complete a task and extending the time as you progress.\n\nSet boundaries around use\n\nGragert says you can still use your phone and other personal gadgets, but it may be best to set boundaries if you're worried about your screen time. For example, maybe don't use your phone right when you wake up, since it may raise your cortisol levels, which can make you feel emotional. You may also avoid using your phone an hour before bed to start winding down and avoid seeing anything online that can make you emotional before sleep.\n\nDownload productivity apps\n\nMy husband uses Opal, an app that helps him reduce his screen time. You'll pick apps and websites that are counterproductive, and Opal will lock you out of those apps for designated hours (like while you're working). If you need access to those apps, you can request a break but it will give you different notifications reminding you that the app or site is blocked during that time.\n\nCNET's wellness writer, Giselle Castro-Sloboda, also recommends blocking apps. One standout option is Brick, a magnet that locks you out of apps you choose. You'll open the Brick app to choose which apps to block, use the app button, then tap the Brick to block the apps for an allotted amount of time. When you're ready, you'll tap your phone on the Brick to unblock the apps and websites.\n\nWatch this: Brick: How I Stopped Wasting Time on My iPhone 04:15\n\nEnable your phone settings\n\nAndroid and Apple devices have several features to help reduce screen time. I just tested the App Limits setting on my iPhone 14 Pro to limit my time on Instagram. I have a two-hour limit for my favorite apps every day. Before this setting, my average screen time was 6.5 hours. Now, it's down to slightly under 4 hours a day.\n\nApp Limits allows me to schedule when select apps are available. The setting blocks my apps between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m., but it still gives me options to ignore the limit for one minute, 15 minutes or the remainder of the day in case I need to complete a quick task, like checking the weather or my calendar, before blocking the app again. Here's how App Limits works and how to set it up.\n\nIf phone settings like App Limits don't work for you, try setting an alarm you physically turn off to get you away from your phone. Gragert recommends setting a timer on your microwave or oven. When the timer is done, get up. Try giving yourself 15 minutes to drink water or go for a walk before picking up your phone again.\n\nMethodology\n\nA quantitative online survey was conducted from Oct. 27 to Nov. 9, 2025, with US adults ages 18 to 70 in partnership with Method and Mode. The study surveyed over 3,700 respondents, including N=2,665 CNET Media Group consumers and a nationally representative sample of N=1,050 adults, weighted to US Census benchmarks for age, gender and region. All of the results are quantitative, with differences between sub-segments statistically significant at the 95% confidence level."

            "content": "It's Wednesday, around 6 p.m. It's been a busy day, but I'm already carving a perfectly roasted chicken on my favorite ebony cutting board, the bird's juices spilling out from under crispy skin and filling up the board's reservoir like a moat.\n\nFor years, Ina Garten's roasted chicken — or some variation of it — has been a Sunday tradition for me. It's not particularly decadent or overly involved, but it's reserved for Sundays because of its roughly 2 hours of total cooking time. Now, the same recipe, adapted for the air fryer, hits the table in under an hour.\n\nAfter months of owning an air fryer and experimenting mostly with versions of traditionally fried foods, such as wings, fries and chicken cutlets, I made my first air fryer roast chicken on a whim. Stunned by the speedy cooking time — 25% faster than traditional roasting — tender meat and impossibly crispy skin without the usual tablespoon of butter, I haven't put a bird in the oven since.\n\nOf all the kitchen tools I've collected, and there are many, the air fryer has shifted my cooking paradigm the most, making cooking easier, faster and more foolproof. Few and far between are air fryer fails, and frequent are the discoveries of something I'd been \"making wrong\" all along until I roasted it quickly under spiraling superconvection heat.\n\nSave for the rare batch of cookies or large cut of meat for a dinner party, the air fryer has all but replaced my oven. I plan meals around it: If a recipe calls for my oven — meatloaf, roasted salmon, charred cauliflower — I consider how I might adapt it for the air fryer.\n\nCelebrated chef and restaurateur Stephanie Izard shares my enthusiasm. \"It's such a versatile tool,\" the James Beard Award winner tells me. \"I use mine all the time for dinners,\" she adds, naming fried rice, marinated chicken and salmon as a few of her go-tos. \"It's like making one-pot meals — but roasted!\"\n\nWe're not alone.\n\nAccording to a CNET survey, over 70% of US adults either own or plan to own an air fryer within the year. Additional studies estimate that about 60% of American households have already made the purchase.\n\nTo put that in perspective: Since the turn of the century, only a small handful of products -- smartphones, Bluetooth speakers -- have matched this level of rapid, widespread adoption for a novel consumer technology category. And no other kitchen appliance even comes close.\n\nEven at its peak, the limited available sales data suggest that the Instant Pot -- a digitized pressure cooker and slow cooker in one --never reached such heights. Instant Pot sales have steadily declined following the multicooker boom, and the company that made most of them filed for bankruptcy in 2023. The air fryer, meanwhile, has rocketed from trendy novelty to everyday essential in record time and shows no signs of slowing.\n\nGuy Fieri, the chef, restaurateur and impresario of TV cooking shows, is another high-profile acolyte. \"An air fryer has a permanent place on my kitchen counter,\" Fieri tells me. He cites wings, roasted potatoes and leftover egg rolls as a few staples that are regulars in his air fryer. \"You can crisp, roast or reheat and still get that pro-level finish every time.\"\n\nOnce pitched as a healthier alternative to deep-frying, air fryers are now edging out ovens, toasters and grills for everyday use. For many people I spoke to, the air fryer has become the most frequently used appliance in their kitchen, reshaping cooking routines and eating habits.\n\nEvery member of my own family and most of my friends keep an air fryer planted on the counter. Some, like my sister, who regularly cooks for a household of five, uses it so often for quick snacks and meals that she jokingly refers to life \"before and after the air fryer\" as two very different realities.\n\nAn entire ecosystem has emerged around air fryers as well. Recipe bloggers, cooking influencers, accessory makers and air fryer manufacturers have all contributed to the movement, solidifying the device's place at the center of fast and modern home cooking.\n\nWhat is everyone air-frying?\n\nAir fryers may have made their debut as the go-to gadget for crisping up wings and fries, but fans have quickly realized that these countertop convection powerhouses can handle much more than game-day fare.\n\nTake Jenny Catton, a UK-based food blogger who bought her first air fryer in 2022. Three plus years and one torrid affair with a small appliance later, Catton now runs The Air Fryer Kitchen, a popular recipe blog dedicated to air fryer cooking.\n\nCole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Jenny Catton\n\nLike many, Catton initially used her air fryer for frozen foods and pub-style snacks, but her approach quickly evolved. Now, her weekly staples include air-fried salmon wrapped in foil with herbs and butter and batches of homemade granola.\n\nHer readers have also moved beyond the basics. Two of the most-visited recipes on The Air Fryer Kitchen? Banana chocolate chip muffins and pork steaks.\n\nA quick internet search surfaces dozens of other websites dedicated to air fryer cooking, and old-guard food magazines are getting in on the act. Epicurious, Food & Wine and others have lists of air fryer recipes that are many scrolls long and include fare decidedly not for game day. Think air-fried burrata and air-fried roast chicken with rosemary and orange sauce.\n\nWhile the air fryer's top-down heat and smaller size may not be suitable for all things — large roasts and most baking projects are still best in a traditional oven — one could go months using only an air fryer and not run out of new things to cook. And one — me — often does.\n\nFor a prior story, we asked chefs about the best vegetables to air-fry, and the list was long. Most meat and seafood also turn out rather well in an air fryer.\n\nIn our own testing, we unearthed even more unusual air fryer success stories. The fierce, fast heat of the air fryer is enough to char a burger patty to medium-rare in minutes (and you can toast the bun while you're at it). Grilled cheese turns out crisp and less soggy than when pan-fried in oil, and hot dogs earn their coveted caramelized snap without firing up the Weber. For reheating leftovers, the microwave consistently falls short of what an air fryer can do in roughly the same amount of time.\n\nEnlarge Image Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Font texture assisted by AI\n\nSo what's really behind the surge in air fryer popularity? For Catton, it all comes down to speed.\n\n\"Air fryers can handle nearly any dish you'd cook in a traditional oven, but in a fraction of the time,\" she says. \"They're ideal for busy people. Once someone tries an air fryer, they usually tell their friends, and then those friends want one too.\"\n\nCNET's survey supports her claim: 64% of respondents said they use their air fryer because it cooks faster, and 65% cited its simplicity.\n\nAnother big driver? A healthier approach to comfort food. Air fryers promise the crispy indulgence of fried favorites with a fraction of the oil.\n\nAccording to Ninja, one of the leading producers of air fryers globally, the mighty convection cookers use 75% less oil than deep-frying to achieve the same or similar results.\n\n\"[The air fryer] has a permanent place on my kitchen counter.\" Guy Fieri, chef and restaurateur\n\nTo arrive at this figure, the company, which has a sensory team dedicated to refining the recipes and real-world functionality of its kitchen appliances, conducted extensive testing and consumer research. First, it identified the ideal french fry texture when cooked in oil, then cooked fries in the air fryer using a bit more oil every time until taste testers declared them equal to their deep-fried counterparts.\n\nHealthier fries that taste like the real thing would be reason enough for many of us to splurge, but Ninja's precise calculation applies to dozens of other traditionally fried foods. For serial snackers, the appeal of the air fryer is sizable and clear.\n\nWho's buying air fryers? Everyone\n\nIf you'd asked me a decade ago which kitchen gadget would revolutionize home cooking, I would've confidently said the multicooker. Fast forward 10 years: Instant Pot sales have cooled, and the air fryer has undeniably claimed the mantle.\n\nBy the late 2010s, air fryer sales were already soaring — an impressive feat for any new product category. Then the pandemic hit. Like many home-centric devices, air fryers saw explosive growth during lockdown, with sales jumping 76% from 2020 to 2021. That surge translated to 25.6 million units sold and nearly $1 billion in revenue.\n\nIt would be easy to chalk that up to a pandemic-fueled fad, but the momentum didn't stop. During the height of COVID-19, approximately 36% of Americans owned an air fryer. That number has since nearly doubled. Last year, sales rose another 10.2%.\n\nThe US leads the charge by far. In 2023, American consumers accounted for $233.8 million of the more than $1 billion in global air fryer sales. The UK, the second-largest market, trailed with under $90 million.\n\nInterest in air fryers spans generational lines as well. Our survey found that 62% of Gen Xers use an air fryer, followed by millennials and Baby Boomers at 56% each, and Gen Z at 51%.\n\nEnlarge Image Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Ketchup font texture assisted by AI\n\nIn short, everyone seems to be hot on air fryers. According to Statista, if current trends continue, 113.6 million more air fryers will be sold by 2029.\n\nThe rise of the air fryer: How did we get here?\n\nThe air fryer made its market debut in 2010, when Philips acquired a patent for \"rapid air technology\" from the late Dutch inventor Fred van der Weij, who developed the prototype four years earlier.\n\nThe idea was straightforward: intense convection heat, driven by a high-powered fan, circulates hot air around the food at high speed. This rapid airflow crisps the outer layers while keeping the inside moist — mimicking the effect of deep-frying, but without all the oil.\n\nAt first, the air fryer seemed like another passing gimmick, something destined for the QVC clearance bin alongside Slap Chop, Juicero and countless other overhyped, underused kitchen tools.\n\n\"As living spaces shrink, especially in cities, an air fryer could be more practical than a full wall oven.\" Jenny Catton, food blogger\n\nThe somewhat awkward name didn't help its credibility. Nor did early endorsements from overexposed celebrity chefs like Emeril Lagasse and Gordon Ramsay, both known for pushing branded cooking gadgets with perhaps a little too much enthusiasm.\n\nYet, the air fryer slowly earned its place in home kitchens, building a loyal fan base and influential backers. A turning point occurred in 2016 when Oprah included it in her cult-followed \"Favorite Things\" list. From there, its status began to solidify -- joining the ranks of the blender, slow cooker and cast-iron skillet as an indispensable cooking tool. Ten years later, an air fryer — this time Cosori's TurboBlaze smart oven — maintains a coveted spot on Winfrey's curated gifting list.\n\nDave Farmer, CEO of Versuni, which acquired Philips' air fryer business in 2021, recalls another landmark moment that signaled the world was taking air fryers seriously.\n\n\"At a certain point, we saw consumer packaged goods including air fryer cooking instructions on the back of the box, along with stovetop, oven and microwave,\" he tells me. \"Now air fryer directions are standard on bags of french fries, boxes of veggie burgers and other quick-fire frozen foods.\"\n\nThe glass air fryer era is upon us\n\nUntil recently, air fryers largely came in one of two forms.\n\nThe most common type is a basket-style air fryer, recognizable by its pull-out drawer. These models typically include a single basket with a perforated tray — or a nested perforated basket — that allows air to circulate around the food for even crisping.\n\nInside an air fryer, a high-powered fan circulates hot air around the food at high speed using rapid airflow to crisp the outer layers of the food Cole Kan/Jeffrey Hazelwood/CNET/Getty Images\n\nThere are also oven-style air fryers, which resemble a standard toaster oven but are supercharged with air fryer technology. These versions typically come with multiple racks and baking trays, offering more cooking space. They're also, on balance, more expensive and decidedly more onerous to clean.\n\nBut in late 2024, Ninja disrupted the category with a bold new design: a glass-chamber air fryer called the Crispi. Unlike anything else on the market, the nontoxic Crispi quickly shot to the top of our best air fryers list after we tested more than 24 models. It's the one I use at home and has become my recommendation for readers, friends and family.\n\nAccording to Ninja, the Crispi didn't just impress me — it made waves across the industry, earning widespread acclaim and garnering over 715 million social media impressions since its launch.\n\nLess polished versions of the glass air fryer preceded the Crispi, and several brands, including Kismile, quickly launched copycat models. Like a boom within a boom, these transparent, nontoxic and high-performance air fryers are poised to become the new norm — or at least a defining option — in future design.\n\nAs a longtime leader in home appliances with a rosy market outlook, Ninja isn't taking its foot off the gas.\n\nI visited Ninja's sprawling campus headquarters just outside Boston, where the team was preparing to launch the Crispi Pro, a $280 update of its headline-making appliance. The brand, known also for its powerful vacuums, blenders and other small home appliances, currently has a whopping 20 air fryers on the market and many more products featuring an air fryer setting or similar technology.\n\n\"I wish someone would make a supersized version.\" Stephanie Izard, chef and restaurateur\n\nI was invited into the test kitchen, where Ninja's sensory team tests air fryer recipes and delivers its findings back to the folks in engineering. Ninja's 3D printing operation enables them to create physical representations of air fryer concepts in just hours, allowing consumer-ready models to hit shelves faster than ever.\n\nGregory Fish, Ninja's head of product design, is bullish on the air fryer segment and credits the Crispi's success to two standout features: its glass cooking chamber and modular design. The glass allows home cooks to watch their food cook in real time, and the entire chamber is 100% nontoxic, with no nonstick coating. That also makes it easier to deep-clean, whether by hand or in the dishwasher.\n\n\"Much of the insight came from seeing people use their air fryers for everything from simple reheating to full meals,\" Fish says.\n\nBeyond the added capacity, convenience and toxin-free makeup of the larger, more modular Crispi, what really struck a chord with consumers was this air fryer's potential to replace their oven altogether.\n\nCan air fryers really replace ovens?\n\nWith air fryers now in roughly six out of 10 US homes and ownership growing steadily, it's fair to ask: How far can this air fryer thing go?\n\nAmong owners, usage is impressively high. According to Data Bridge Market Research, the average household turns to its air fryer 4.2 times per week, replacing traditional oven use for 35% of cooking occasions.\n\nI asked Catton, the air fryer recipe blogger, whether she thinks air fryers will eventually overtake full-size ovens. For her, it's not a question of if, but when.\n\n\"I think this will happen,\" Catton says. \"As living spaces shrink, especially in cities, an air fryer could be more practical than a full wall oven.\"\n\nEnlarge Image Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Chefman/Cuisinart\n\nCapacity is one of the few advantages that traditional ovens still have over their modern counterparts. You'll still need them for your Thanksgiving turkey. However, air fryers excel in speed and energy efficiency — they cook faster, use less energy and don't require preheating.\n\nThey're also relatively cheap, with budget models available for as little as $50. Higher-end air fryers exist, but it's not a complex technology. If you're paying more than $200 for an air fryer, you're probably overpaying.\n\n\"Whether you're a new cook or a pro, it's the easiest way to bring the heat and still keep it healthy.\" Guy Fieri\n\nNinja, which gathers extensive user feedback, shares Catton's optimism. \"We're seeing people cook entire meals -- chicken on one side, Brussels sprouts on the other,\" a rep for the company told me. \"In many ways, it's replacing how people use their oven.\"\n\nTraditional oven manufacturers have taken notice. Many modern models, including my Samsung induction oven, now feature built-in air fryer settings. I've tested a few — they get the job done, but they lack what makes standalone air fryers shine: a compact chamber that circulates hot air quickly and evenly for that signature crisp.\n\nWhat health experts say about air fryers\n\nMost health experts agree that air fryers can be a healthier alternative to deep-frying. By using little to no oil, one can reduce calories by up to 80% and significantly lower fat intake.\n\nEnlarge Image According to Ninja, air fryers use 75% less oil than deep-frying to achieve the same crispy texture for French fries. Cole Kan/CNET/Getty Images/Font texture assisted by AI\n\nIn a Cleveland Clinic investigation into the health benefits of air fryer cooking, dietitian Julia Zumpano noted that air fryers \"eliminate the need for added oils entirely.\" Research shows that air frying can reduce acrylamide — a potentially carcinogenic compound found in fried potatoes — by up to 90%.\n\nBut let's be clear: air fryers aren't a panacea for an unhealthy diet. They can't remove saturated fat from bacon or trans fats from highly processed snacks. Cooking empty carbs with less oil still leaves you with empty carbs.\n\nThe British Heart Foundation echoes this nuance. Air frying doesn't offer extra health benefits for foods that don't typically require added fat to begin with, such as sausages, bacon or pre-breaded chicken. In those cases, it's just a different way to cook, not necessarily a healthier one.\n\nAnd so the quest for healthy bacon continues.\n\nWhat chefs think about air fryers\n\nWhile dietitians are quick to praise air fryers, it's harder to find career chefs who share the sentiment, with many dismissing them or refusing to offer comment.\n\nStephanie Izard is an exception. A champion of Top Chef and Iron Chef, Izard owns six acclaimed restaurants, most in Chicago, and proudly admits she \"always has an air fryer on the counter.\"\n\n\"I love using it to bake small batches,\" Izard says. \"It [cooks] so evenly compared to my convection oven, and it heats up incredibly fast. They're perfect for crisping pork belly or other proteins, and for roasting vegetables like squash or Brussels sprouts to get that nice crunch without deep frying.\"\n\nAs for using an air fryer in one of those six restaurant kitchens, Izard laments that \"they're just not big enough to be practical. I wish someone would make a supersized version.\"\n\nSince the turn of the century, only the smartphone has matched the air fryer's level of rapid, widespread adoption for a new category of consumer technology.\n\nFieri, who soared to celebrity status with the show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives, is so enamored with air fryers that he has added one to his Flavortown kitchen and cookware collection, featuring a steam function designed to keep food from drying out. (Phillips also makes a steam air fryer.)\n\nAsked about the use of air fryers in professional settings, Fieri says, \"I'm starting to see more chefs use air fryer-style tech for quick tests or catering gigs. They're efficient, cleaner and great for nailing texture without dropping everything in oil.\"\n\nThat love for the air fryer doesn't extend to all chefs and food influencers.\n\nYouTube chef Brian Lagerstrom has been notably vocal in his criticism, calling air fryers \"kinda dumb\" and advocating for traditional stove-oven combinations. Other culinary pros, such as TV chef James Martin, expressed similar doubts, dismissing air fryers as merely tabletop convection ovens with limited applications and middling results.\n\nWhether air fryers find their way into restaurant kitchens and favor with the culinary elite is, in some ways, irrelevant. Consumers are plunking them down on their counters at a record clip and, according to many I've spoken with, finding more ways to use them. More than 15 years into the air fryer era, with sales still on the rise, it feels safe to move the air fryer from a cooking trend to a kitchen staple.\n\nAs Fieri puts it, using his unmistakable parlance, \"I'm about tools that make cooking more fun and flavorful. Whether you're a new cook or a pro, it's the easiest way to bring the heat and still keep it healthy.\"\n\nFor me, there's no going back\n\nTo understand the unique value an air fryer offers the average home cook and, thus, its breakneck rise in popularity, you needn't look further than my Sunday roast chicken — now available on weekdays.\n\nSimply put, air fryers cook food fast and with less oil or grease. The results, at least for many foods cooked with superconvection, are as good or better than other clunkier, slower, greasier methods -- a sentiment backed by a few of the world's most celebrated chefs.\n\nThat a reliable unit can be had for less than $75 only bolsters its quest for a home in every kitchen.\n\nWhile some drag their feet, still writing the air fryer off as a nothing gimmick, nothing more than a toaster oven with a funny name, unworthy of the countertop real estate it demands, I'll be here enjoying my chicken, salmon, grilled cheese, and whatever revelation comes next.\n\nCNET commissioned YouGov Plc to conduct the survey cited here. All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 1,190 adults, of whom 839 own an air fryer or are planning on buying one in the next 12 months. Fieldwork was undertaken Sept. 24-25, 2025. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all US adults (aged 18 plus).\n\nVisual Designer | Cole Kan\n\nArt Director | Jeffrey Hazelwood\n\nCreative Director | Viva Tung\n\nVideo Host/Editor | JD Christison\n\nCamera Operator | Owen Poole\n\nProject Manager | Danielle Ramirez\n\nEditors | Corinne Reichert, Katie Collins\n\nDirector of Content | Jonathan Skillings"

But seeing official announcements is different from piecing and parsing rumors. Today's event had its share of big news and a few surprises.\n\nWatch this: Samsung Unpacked 2026: The Future of AI Has Arrived (Highlights) 10:34\n\nGalaxy S26 Ultra\n\nOne expected announcement was the reveal of the flagship Galaxy phone, the S26 Ultra. In fact, Samsung barely mentioned the other two phones being rolled out today: the Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Plus.\n\nSamsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra is slightly lighter and thinner than the S25 Ultra, features the new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 processor for Galaxy, has an aluminum frame instead of titanium, and incorporates new display technology, including Privacy Display.\n\nThe S26 Ultra became the hook on which almost everything else announced at the event hung, from AI features to camera technology.\n\nCNET's Abrar Al-Heeti wrote about her first hands-on experience with the Galaxy S26 Ultra, and we'll follow up with full reviews of it and the other S26 phones as we have more time to test them out.\n\nS26 Ultra Privacy Display\n\nPhone display news typically centers on brightness and resolution, but Samsung Unpacked revealed a new technology that looks genuinely useful in everyday situations.\n\nSnoopy coworkers? Privacy Display can thwart their nosy efforts. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\n\"Look\" is probably the wrong word, though, because the Privacy Display feature lets you hide sensitive information on your screen. It's like a sheet of privacy film that can be turned on or off and applied to specific apps and content.\n\nWhen you turn on Privacy Display, people sneaking peeks at your phone from the sides will see just a darkened screen. Or you can choose to enable it when, for example, you're using your banking app or sending text messages. The technology isn't just a full-screen, all-on/all-off implementation: You can configure it so that only incoming notifications get the privacy treatment.\n\nNarrow pixels focus light output to reduce the field of view. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nThis is all accomplished using a clever technology Samsung calls Black Matrix. Normally, display pixels are designed to cast light in the widest possible angle for better visibility. With the Black Matrix, some display pixels include physical rings that can narrow their light output and disrupt visibility from the sides.\n\nCNET's Katie Collins thinks Privacy Display is the one feature that sets the S26 Ultra apart from every other phone right now, and Macy Meyer is looking forward to scrolling in peace away from \"shoulder surfers.\"\n\nGalaxy S26 and S26 Plus\n\nThe S26 phones most people will buy got only a few mentions, but a few things about them stand out, as CNET's Patrick Holland explains in his first-hand look.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Plus Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nThe Galaxy S26 has a larger screen than the S25 it replaces, which means it's also slightly taller and wider. However, it keeps the same 7.8mm thickness, which Holland says makes it feel slimmer overall. That design also includes a larger, 4,300-mAh battery, which is welcome news; the S26 Plus includes the same 4,900-mAh battery as its predecessor.\n\nNot as welcome? Both phones are now $100 more expensive than the ones they replace, at $900 and $1,100 for the 256GB models. (The Galaxy S26 Ultra, however, keeps its $1,300 price tag.)\n\nAll New Samsung Browser, Including Perplexity\n\nI know this comes as a shock, but AI featured heavily in Samsung's presentation. And while a lot of the language is still couched in the future-tense \"you will be able to,\" Samsung did show off some practical applications of AI.\n\nSamsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIt introduced a new Samsung Browser that, at heart, is tied to AI vendor Perplexity. Using an Ask AI tool, the browser can research queries across all the browser tabs, and even your search history, to bring up the answers you're looking for.\n\nPatrick Holland got more details about Samsung's and Perplexity's relationship.\n\nNow Nudge\n\nAnother AI tool announced at the event is Now Nudge, a feature intended to feel like a low-key personal assistant but not one that tries to micromanage your life.\n\nNow Nudge is envisioned as a less-intrusive personal assistant. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIn the example Samsung gave, when a friend mentions photos you and they shared in a chat, Now Nudge could surface those photos so you have them ready to share, instead of digging through your photo library to find them.\n\nOr, it can bring up calendar events related to a conversation: When a friend asks if you're free on a specific date to go out for dinner, Now Nudge can pop that day up without you leaving the chat app. According to Samsung, \"it helps you stay in your flow.\"\n\nIt's certainly interesting to see at least a partial acknowledgment that not everyone wants AI to handle every task.\n\nGalaxy Buds 4 Series\n\nIt wasn't all phones at the Galaxy Unpacked Event. Samsung introduced the Galaxy Buds 4 earbuds, showcasing a fresh look and numerous internal changes. The woofer design is wider, with 20% more vibration area for deeper, richer sound.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds 4 Pro come in four color options, including a new pink gold color. Vanessa Teal/CNET\n\nCNET's David Carnoy, in his review, says the $250 Galaxy Buds 4 Pro offer excellent sound with upgraded drivers, updated noise cancelling and top-tier voice calling and transparency mode.\n\nThey're available for preorder on Feb. 26 and begin shipping March 11.\n\nSmarter Circle to Search\n\nSamsung and Google really, really want you to shop for clothing using AI, it seems. The Circle to Search feature, which lets you identify an item in a photo and get more information about it, has been updated to let you select multiple items within the circle.\n\nUse Circle to Search to view all items of a person's outfit. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nIn Samsung's example, you can draw a circle around someone's entire outfit and it will identify all the pieces… shirt, jacket, pants, shoes and the like. Are clothing stores seeing an uptick in sales from features like this, or does it just make for a good demo? We'll have to see for ourselves.\n\nGalaxy AI Photo Editing\n\nCameras are always a big part of new phone announcements, and although the camera hardware in the Galaxy S26 phones remains largely unchanged (the S26 Ultra has wider apertures to let in more light on its main and ultrawide cameras), the AI features continue to press ahead.\n\nTell Galaxy AI how you'd like to edit a photo. Samsung/Screenshot by CNET\n\nOne thing that stood out is the ability to use AI to edit photos by making voice requests or text prompts. This is what the company mentioned before the event when it teased a new \"Galaxy camera experience\" was coming. In one example, the presenter showed how a cupcake with a bite taken out could be repaired (with a not-so-subtle upbraiding of the unnamed friend who dared to chomp before a photo was taken).\n\nThe upside is that people who don't know how to edit photos or are intimidated by the various controls can ask for a result and let the generative AI engine create it for them.\n\nGoogle showed off similar features when it introduced the Pixel 10 Pro last year.\n\nSee Andrew Lanxon's look at what's changed in the S26 camera systems."
