            "content": "OXFORD UNITED have reached a “significant milestone” in their journey towards a new £130million stadium which will boost capacity by thousands.\n\nThe Championship strugglers currently ply their trade at the Kassam Stadium, named after former owner Firoz Kassam.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpened in 2001 after a lengthy £15m construction, it holds 12,500 supporters and has bore witness to a host of memorable events — including an Elton John concert in 2006.\n\nHowever, Oxford confirmed in 2023 that they will build a new 16,000-seater stadium in Kidlington — a year on after their secret plans were leaked.\n\n\n\nThe EFL outfit announced it would be opened in 2026.\n\nBut it’s only now that Oxford have reached a “significant milestone” after finally getting planning permission from Oxfordshire and Cherwell’s respective Councils.\n\nThe new stadium will boost capacity by 3,5000 seats while also creating a thriving local hub.\n\nThere are plans to build a “180-bedroom hotel, restaurant, conference centre, health and wellbeing space, gym and community plaza” around the arena.\n\n\n\nA hefty £5m will also be “invested into infrastructure and local projects”, with reports claiming Oxford will also pay £930,000 towards the reopening of the Cowley Branch Line — which includes two brand new stations in Cowley and Littlemore.\n\nIn total, the project is expected to cost £130m.\n\nBEST FREE BETS AND BETTING SIGN UP OFFERS\n\n\n\nBut it comes at a time Oxford face potential relegation to League One.\n\nThey have won just six games all season and are six points off safety, having finished 17th last term following promotion the year before that.\n\nHowever, Oxford United Chairman, Grant Ferguson, believes the future is exciting with a new stadium now green-lit.\n\nHe said: “Signing the Section 106 Agreement and receiving formal planning approval brings us one step closer to delivering a new home for our Club. It also underlines the commitment of our owners to make a significant investment into the UK and Oxfordshire.\n\n\n\n“The new stadium is designed not only as a home for men’s and women’s football, but as a major community and business hub that supports local and regional economic growth, sustainability objectives and long‑term wellbeing across the county.\n\n“I’d like to thank Oxfordshire County Council, Cherwell District Council, our project team and the many community groups, supporters and stakeholders who have contributed constructively throughout this process.\n\n“While important steps remain, this milestone gives us the platform to move forward with confidence as we focus on the next stages of this once-in-a-generation opportunity.”"

It’s been a painful season for supporters to endure, with just one victory in 28 games and only 18 league goals scored, leaving them 17 points from safety with ten matches remaining.\n\nThere was more agony last weekend as they slipped to a 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace following Tolu Arokodare’s missed penalty. But there would be at least some satisfaction in seeing off their rivals — and avoiding the ignominy of being labelled the worst side in Premier League history.\n\nRob Edwards’ side need just two more points to surpass Derby’s record-low tally of 11 from the 2007-08 season, and their reasonable record in this fixture could yet help them get there.\n\nWolves have won four of their last six Premier League home games against Aston Villa (D1 L1) and are unbeaten in the last four at Molineux since a 1-0 defeat in December 2020.\n\nAston Villa won’t want that happening on their watch, but denting their rivals’ hopes is probably the least of their worries after a difficult stretch.\n\nUnai Emery’s side have managed just one Premier League win in their last four outings and now find themselves looking over their shoulder. They sit just three points clear of fourth-placed Manchester United and only six ahead of Champions League-chasing Chelsea and Liverpool.\n\nA return to winning ways is needed.\n\nThe good news for the Villans is their recent record in this fixture. They’ve won three of their last four Premier League meetings with Wolves – as many as they managed in the previous 15 combined.\n\n\n\nThey’ve also taken 22 points from their 13 away league matches this season, a record bettered only by leaders Arsenal.\n\nWolves vs Aston Villa preview betting odds\n\nWolves 29/10 with Spreadex – CLAIM HERE\n\nDraw 27/10 with Midnite – CLAIM HERE\n\nAston Villa 9/10 with BetMGM – CLAIM HERE\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publication and are subject to change.\n\nHow to claim £30 welcome bonus Midnite offer Download the Midnite app or create an account online HERE*\n\nRegister using the code: BETGET30\n\nDeposit a minimum of £10\n\nPlace a £10 sportsbook bet at minimum odds of 1/1\n\nFree Bets will be credited upon settlement of your qualifying bet Midnite: Get £30 in football free bets\n\nWolves vs Aston Villa preview betting tips and predictions\n\nHow’s stat\n\nWe’re backing Wolves-destroyer Tammy Abraham to get on the scoresheet this Friday, available at 8/5 with Betfair.\n\nAbraham – who has netted in each of his last two – has scored more league goals against Wolves than any other opponent in his career, netting six times. That includes a hat-trick in his first Premier League meeting with them for Chelsea back in September 2019.\n\nTo put it simply: three starts, six goals.

            "content": "ARSENAL host Chelsea this weekend in a huge clash which could be pivotal for both the title and Champions League races.\n\nThe Gunners are five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League as they face the Blues.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam Rosenior‘s top five-chasing visitors represent the most significant test at the Emirates between now and the end of the season.\n\nAnd if there are any naysayers over the importance of tactics, take it from Declan Rice.\n\nThe £105million star told SunSport it was “impossible” to go into a game without being tactically sound.\n\nRice, 27, reserved particular praise for Mikel Arteta, admitting it took him a while to grasp the manager’s impressive sessions.\n\n\n\nAnd Arsenal versus Chelsea will come down to them being able to beat the low block Rosenior is likely to set up with, particularly given the history of recent clashes seen in the League Cup at the last game in north London.\n\nChelsea have something of a selection headache with no Marc Cucurella at left-back, leaving a choice of Jorrel Hato or Malo Gusto. Wesley Fofana is also out after his suspension earned at Burnley.\n\nStrangely enough, the way the Gunners could counter the low block is by throwing fewer players forward.\n\nThe idea behind this would be to use Chelsea’s own shape against them to lure them forwards into a higher-press shape, which would then potentially free up space for attacking options such as Bukayo Saka.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nThere is also an argument for Ben White to be selected over Jurrien Timber, who has looked tired due to an extraordinary amount of games.\n\nWhite’s ability to overlap and hold width could be the best way to create additional space between the lines for Saka to exploit, as once again he will be at the heart of everything Arsenal do well.\n\nThe Full Arsenal on YouTube SunSport have launched a dedicated Arsenal channel on YouTube! The Full Arsenal Podcast is your home for everything about the Gunners. From match reactions and tactical breakdowns to transfer talk, match previews, tactical analysis and honest fan debate… The Full Arsenal covers it all. Subscribe to The Full Arsenal here\n\nHowever, Arteta also has a selection headache over Martin Odegaard.\n\nOdegaard is the captain, but Eberechi Eze showed his class with a stunning display in last week’s north London derby, second only to Man of the Match Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nBoth provide key attributes for Arsenal, emphasising the strength in depth they have.\n\n\n\nBut it is very much a case of ‘horses for courses’. That indecision in the Arsenal camp will be playing on Chelsea’s mind in their pre-match prep.\n\nOdegaard, when he plays, is the leader of the Arsenal press, and with Chelsea possessing a number of press-resistant players, that will put pressure on the visitors in dangerous areas.\n\nThe Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube Calling all Chelsea fans - we have a brand new YouTube channel! The Sun’s Chelsea YouTube channel will be your go-to destination for the latest news, transfer updates, match previews, post-match analysis, exclusive interviews, fan reactions, and breaking stories from Stamford Bridge. Subscribe to The Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube now\n\nIf Arsenal get their press right, they will win the ball back with Chelsea off-balance, which will free up the Gunners’ firepower going forward.\n\nEveryone who has watched Arsenal this season is well aware of their proficiency at set-pieces.\n\nRosenior used an interesting counter-move the last time the two teams met by placing players high up the field at corners, meaning Arsenal had to sacrifice some of their own numbers in the box to mark them.\n\n\n\nIt is a move that is becoming more popular, and it’s easy to imagine it will be the same again on Sunday.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThat being said, Arsenal are the best team in the league, possibly the world at set-pieces, so this cat-and-mouse tactic may not be used at every single corner.\n\nThe likes of Reece James or Joao Pedro may see fit to make the decision depending on the flow of the game."

            "content": "FORMER Chelsea star Jody Morris has revealed Frank Lampard did not have a single discussion with owner Roman Abramovich while manager.\n\nThe revelation stunned Premier League icon Joleon Lescott, who labelled the lack of contact “insane”.\n\n\n\n\n\nLampard, 46, boasts the second most Premier League appearances ever for Chelsea, behind John Terry.\n\nBut his certified legend status did not help him break the ice when he was brought back to the club years after his retirement in a new role as head coach.\n\nLampard stepped away from the club in 2014, but was hired half a decade later to steady the ship after Maurizio Sarri departed as manager.\n\nBut according to the former England man’s assistant coach Morris, 47, Lampard had no contact with club chairman Abramovich during his 18-months in charge between 2019 and early 2021.\n\n\n\nInstead the assistant and former Blues midfielder claimed that club director Marina Granovskaia was the one running show.\n\nMorris, who followed Lampard when he made the switch from Derby County to Stamford Bridge, opened up on their communication issues on the All Out Football podcast.\n\nHe said: “(Lampard) never had one conversation with Roman (Abramovich) the whole time he was there.\n\n“The whole time when we went back there, Marina was running the club.\n\n\n\nSUN VEGAS WELCOME OFFER: GET £50 BONUS WHEN YOU JOIN\n\n“Frank Lampard is the manager of Chelsea and he never had one conversation with Roman as manager.”\n\nReports at the time of Lampard’s dismissal made similar claims, and reiterated Granovskaia’s importance in the club hierarchy.\n\nA stunned Lescott chimed in: “You’re saying that now, I’m thinking’ that’s insane.”\n\n\n\nMorris doubled down, adding: “He had conversations when he played for Chelsea, but then you come back as manager and they didn’t have one conversation, and he wanted to.”\n\nLampard led his side to fourth and an FA Cup final in his first season in the dugout.\n\nBut results took a nosedive in his second term and he was sacked in January 2021.\n\nThe Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube Calling all Chelsea fans - we have a brand new YouTube channel!

However, under current circumstances we believe it is best to change managers.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at the club, the board and personally, I would like to thank Frank for his work as head coach and wish him every success in the future.”"

Kasper Hjulmand’s side had finished 16th in the league phase table previously.\n\nAtalanta, in contrast, made harder work of their progression to the last-16, having lost their first-leg fixture away at Dortmund 2-0.

Following an eventful week of knockout play-off drama, the final 16 clubs have now been confirmed.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe seeded Blues were able to sit this stage out - having finished sixth during the league phase - but the draw has left them with two possible matchups, neither of which are particularly inviting. Chelsea will face either a fiery all-English showdown with Newcastle or a headline-grabbing encounter against reigning champions PSG.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNewcastle booked their place in the last 16 with a dominant 9-3 aggregate win over Qarabag, while PSG squeezed past Monaco 5-4 over two legs in a thrilling all-French battle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea will be paired with one of those sides, while the other will meet Barcelona. Below, Mirror Football breaks down both potential contests and weighs up which opponent Chelsea would rather steer clear of.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nChampions League last-16 draw as Premier League clubs learn potential opponents READ MORE :\n\nOption 1: PSG\n\nThe current European title holders narrowly avoided a shock exit in the play-offs. After a chaotic opening leg, Luis Enrique's men were pushed to the limit by Monaco, even though they spent significant periods of both matches playing against 10 men.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey sit two points ahead of Lens at the Ligue 1 summit and are widely expected to secure a fifth consecutive domestic crown. However, their recent performances have been somewhat inconsistent. PSG closed out the Champions League group phase with two losses and two draws from five matches and they have also suffered domestic defeats to Rennes and local rivals Paris FC in recent weeks.\n\nEven so, the squad is packed with elite-level quality. Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Desire Doue - who scored twice in the first leg against Monaco - and Bradley Barcola make up one of the most dangerous forward lines in the game. With Vitinha, Joao Neves and Nuno Mendes orchestrating play behind them, PSG possess the quality and firepower to punish any opponent.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea beat PSG in the final of the Club World Cup last year (Image: getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere are, however, weaknesses at the back. They have shipped eight goals in their last four matches in all competitions and have managed just two clean sheets in Europe this term.\n\nChelsea will also draw confidence from their emphatic victory over PSG in the Club World Cup final last year. Few expected the Blues to prevail, yet they produced a superb display to claim a convincing 3-0 win and lift the trophy in style.\n\nOption 2: Newcastle\n\nAlthough Newcastle currently sit 11th in the Premier League table, they have looked transformed on the continental stage this season. They tore Qarabag apart in the play-offs, virtually settling the tie with a 6-1 first-leg rout before completing the job with a 3-2 success in the return fixture.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring the group phase, they registered victories over Benfica, PSV and Athletic Bilbao, and earned away draws against PSG and Bayer Leverkusen. That said, their domestic results have been disappointing recently. Eddie Howe's side have been beaten in four of their last five league outings - and six of their last nine matches in all competitions.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea haven't the strongest of record against Newcastle recently (Image: getty)\n\nStill, Newcastle won't be pushovers. Chelsea are well aware of the intensity, physical battles and the electric environment at St James' Park that will come with drawing the Magpies. While league consistency has deserted them, European nights appear to inspire them - particularly the likes of Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea's recent record against Newcastle since the PIF takeover is also concerning. The Blues have failed to win any of their last three meetings with the Toon and have claimed only three victories from their past nine encounters overall - with one of those successes requiring extra time.\n\nOn the other hand, Chelsea will believe they can find the net against Newcastle, who have conceded 17 goals in their last eight matches in all competitions. Notably, if the draw pairs the two sides together, they would meet three times within a week, as their upcoming Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge would fall between the two European legs.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea will face either PSG or Newcastle (Image: Dave Winter/Shutterstock)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR CHELSEA FB PAGE! Latest Blues news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nVerdict\n\nUltimately, PSG would represent the more daunting prospect for Chelsea. Newcastle pose a threat, but Chelsea would likely enter that tie as favourites given their stronger league form and greater squad depth. It would also mark the Blues' first European meeting with Premier League opposition since their victory over Manchester City in the 2021 Champions League final.\n\nPSG, by contrast, offer a different level of challenge. They are the defending champions, boast recent experience of lifting the trophy and have match-winners across the pitch capable of changing a contest instantly.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAn away night at St James' Park is never easy, but travelling to Paris to take on the holders is the scenario Chelsea will hope to avoid when the draw is made tomorrow."

Arsenal are believed to be optimistic about signing him for as low as £75m.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to The Sun, Arsenal will pursue a deal for the 25-year-old this summer, despite attention from Liverpool and United.\n\nMikel Arteta is reported to be a long-standing admirer of the winger, with speculation surrounding the Gunners first surfacing earlier this year.\n\nNow, Arsenal are said to be leading the chase ahead of Liverpool and United, and there is confidence within the club that ex-Everton ace Gordon would be receptive to a transfer to north London.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJesse Lingard in line for shock Man Utd reunion after latest transfer twist READ MORE :\n\nCristiano Ronaldo sent transfer request after buying 25 per cent stake in club READ MORE :\n\nHe has two years left on his contract, and whilst Newcastle are reluctant to part with him, there is a sense that a deal could be possible if the right fee was offered.\n\nDespite Gordon's Premier League and international credentials, the same report suggests Arsenal are targeting to secure him for a fee in the region of £75-£80m.\n\nGordon, however, rejected speculation of a transfer last week and maintains he is content at Newcastle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR ARSENAL FB PAGE! Latest Gunners news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nWhen quizzed about the rumours of him being the next major talent to leave Tyneside, he told Chronicle Live: \"About me? I haven't seen them. What are they saying?\"\n\nUpon learning he's been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool recently, Gordon responded: \"It's the same old, same old. I think they just pick names out of a hat. They do (names out of the hat). I haven't heard anything; they might want to tell me before they tell you (the media).\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe added: \"I am focused on me and focused on the team, I am focused on right now.\n\n\"You look too far in the future and you start to underperform. And believe me I have done that [before] and I am not going to do that now.\"\n\nView 2 Images Anthony Gordon could be on the way out of Newcastle this summer (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Gunners seemingly wish to bolster their left-wing department, which could cast Gabriel Martinelli's future into doubt. The Brazilian has been in and out of the team throughout the campaign and has only registered three Premier League goal contributions so far.\n\nBeyond Gordon's evident attributes, his blistering speed and goalscoring threat, Arteta is said to appreciate his adaptability, with Eddie Howe deploying him as a No.9 on multiple occasions this season.\n\nArsenal invested over £250million on eight first-team players last summer, but they are in a position to spend again following extended campaigns in the Champions League and domestic cups.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe Gunners presently occupy top spot in the Premier League and are aiming to bring the title to north London for the first time since 2004. Five points divide them and second-placed Manchester City, though Pep Guardiola's side have a match in hand, with the title battle poised to go down to the wire.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Diego Simeone's side booked their spot in the last-16 following a 7-4 aggregate triumph over Club Brugge.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe first leg had been a thrilling 3-3 draw but Atletico demolished the Belgians 4-1 in the second leg. Turkish giants Galatasaray nearly saw their Champions League ambitions extinguished as they were forced to net twice in extra time to overcome Juventus 7-5 on aggregate, despite going into the second leg with a 5-2 advantage.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Reds have a fascinating and challenging history with both sides. However, neither offers a straightforward route to the Champions League quarter-final. Here, Mirror Football examines the six-time European Champions' potential nightmare scenario.\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nShould Liverpool meet Atletico it will mark the second occasion the sides have clashed this season. Goals from Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson and a late winner from Virgil van Dijk secured the Reds' 3-2 victory over Atletico in a tense encounter at Anfield in September.\n\nHowever, it was a tie notable for a breakdown from Atletico boss Simeone that resulted in him being dismissed by the referee. After defeating Brugge, Simeone even insisted he is \"not thinking about Liverpool\" with a potentially uncomfortable reunion now on the horizon as the notoriously combative Argentinian seeks revenge against the Reds.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMan Utd and Liverpool avoid breaches as PSR status of every Premier League club emerges READ MORE :\n\nChampions League last-16 draw was declared void after huge error occurred READ MORE :\n\nOverall, Liverpool have faced Atletico nine times since 2008. The Reds have triumphed in four of those encounters, drawn two and been defeated three times.\n\nThe positive news for Liverpool is that Atletico are struggling in La Liga this season, having suffered five defeats and drawn six in 25 matches. Simeone's team finished 14th in the Champions League league-phase, losing three, drawing once and winning four.\n\nView 4 Images Diego Simeone was sent off against Liverpool earlier this season (Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhilst Liverpool might not be confronting a classic Atletico outfit, it remains a side driven by unpredictable forwards in the form of Alexander Sorloth, who netted a hat-trick against Brugge, the highly-sought-after Julian Alvarez and veteran Frenchman Antoine Griezmann.\n\nNot forgetting midfielder Marcos Llorente, who has remarkably found the net four times against Liverpool in as many fixtures. Most significantly, and somewhat forebodingly for Slot, Simeone's side have knocked out Liverpool on the two occasions the clubs have clashed in European knockout competition.\n\nIn 2020 with Liverpool then under Jurgen Klopp, Atletico saw off the Reds 4-2 on aggregate, despite Liverpool dominating their opponents at Anfield.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn April 2010, the Spanish titans broke red hearts once more. Atletico netted a late away goal at Anfield in the Europa League semi-finals, causing Liverpool, then under Rafael Benitez, to crash out of the tournament.\n\nGalatasaray\n\nLiverpool have faced the Turkish powerhouse five times in European competition. The Reds have only triumphed in one of those matches, losing two and drawing two.\n\nJust like with Atletico, the Reds have already faced Galatasaray this season, suffering a frustrating defeat at the Ali Sami Yen in September by a single goal - a penalty slotted home by Victor Osimhen.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Victor Osimhen celebrates after Galatasaray's victory over Liverpool (Image: Getty Images)\n\nYou would need to rewind to 2006 to find Liverpool's last victory over the Turkish team. That was a 3-2 win at the Ataturk Stadium with Liverpool then reigning as European Champions under Benitez. Much like the Spanish giants, Okan Buruk's squad boasts an array of striking options that will intimidate any defence.\n\nThis season, Mauro Icardi, Osimhen, Burak Yilmaz and Leroy Sane have amassed 34 goals between them, demonstrating that whatever forward line Buruk selects, the threat is present.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Turkish side also top the Super Lig standings by two points but concluded the Champions League league phase in a disappointing 20th place.\n\nWho would Liverpool rather avoid?\n\nIt's a tough call, quite simply. Atletico likely represent the more challenging tie, due to their fiery temperament, range of attacking talent, and not to mention, typically solid defence.\n\nView 4 Images Julian Alvarez is a threat for Atletico Madrid (Image: Europa Press via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe history between the two clubs, now enhanced by Simeone's red card last September, will also add spice to any potential tie. The fact Atletico have triumphed over Liverpool on every occasion the two have met in a European knockout encounter suggests the odds are in their favour too.\n\nIf this is combined with Liverpool's patchy form this season then it's probable the Reds would prefer to face Galatasaray when the draw is made come Friday.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

George has got the team around him. Kimi [Antonelli] will be stronger this year in the other car, but George is completely out of Lewis [Hamilton]'s shadow there, he's the king of the castle at Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\"He did all those years at Williams and then he went to Mercedes when they just stopped dominating, so he's done the hard yards.\n\n\"I think he's got the experience, he's got the car control, and I think he will command the respect in the team to help drive what's going to be an incredibly changeable year.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Craig Slater and Martin Brundle review and rank all the F1 teams after pre-season testing\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Sky Sports News, Brundle added: \"I think his team-mate Kimi Antonelli will have a great season as well, but George has got all the confidence he needs to win races and to go and win a championship, if it's available to him.\n\n\"We questioned that with Lando [Norris] last year, and Oscar [Piastri] too, whether they would wilt under pressure from Max [Verstappen], and they didn't.\n\n\"I think George is in a very good place.\"\n\nAsked how Russell would handle any increased intra-Mercedes challenge from team-mate Kimi Antonelli, the 19-year-old Italian entering his second year of F1, Brundle added: \"Remember, [Russell] grew up in Lewis Hamilton's shadow at Mercedes, and he handled that, and eventually in the final year they were team-mates, he beat Lewis clearly.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Russell admits his two starts in Bahrain have been 'worse' than his worst-ever start in Formula 1\n\n\"So, I have no doubts about him whatsoever. They're all world-class drivers in F1, you've got to beat them somehow.\n\n\"I think George has got so much experience now despite not being 30 yet, that I don't think anything will distract him if he's got a championship-winning car.\"\n\n'No clear favourite' - Brundle expects open 'big-four' battle\n\nWhile Mercedes may be favourites for both titles heading into the 24-race campaign, Brundle believes they will face a challenge from all three of their established rivals on the evidence of the three winter tests.\n\n\"I see Ferrari being strong, I see both Ferrari drivers being strong,\" said Brundle.\n\n\"I think both McLaren drivers will be strong as well. Oscar will come back on a mission after what he learned last year; Lando, I don't think I've ever seen him yet not with that big grin on his face so far this year, he's just got that comfort now.\n\n\"The Red Bull looks really strong, and we know how Max's car control, which you'll need with these cars, will be incredible.\n\n\"So, for me, there's not a clear favourite.\"\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

            "content": "Football's lawmakers are expected to discuss the idea of a new five-second time limit for goal-kicks and throw-ins, which could put an end to the current long-throw trend in the Premier League.\n\nThey are also expected to increase the scope of VAR to include decisions on second yellow cards, when they meet in Wales on Saturday - with further proposals to crack down on time-wasting also on the agenda.\n\nIf a new five-second time limit is introduced for goal-kicks and throw-ins, it is thought that would effectively mean an end to the increasing trend in the Premier League and EFL for teams to use long-throws as an attacking tactic.\n\nThe International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is made up of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs together with FIFA, holds its AGM each spring. Only at this meeting can the laws of the game be amended, and they then have to be applied worldwide.\n\nHowever, the IFAB board may decide to trial some law changes rather than introduce them permanently, with those laws made optional for individual competitions to consider implementing. While any law changes will not come into effect until July 1 (so, effectively for the start of the next domestic football season) it is likely that FIFA will choose to introduce some of them, as a trial, during this summer's World Cup in North America.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Currently, the Premier League has the lowest intervention rates for VAR of any of the 'big five' European leagues.\n\nFA chief executive Mark Bullingham has spoken publicly about his dislike for the idea, but Pierluigi Collina, FIFA's head of referees, is a strong advocate, arguing that VAR would only get involved in corners where there has been a clear and obvious error.\n\nThere is widespread belief in the game that the introduction of the 'eight-second rule' for goalkeepers has been a success in cracking down on time-wasting - largely because there have been very few incidents this season where a 'keeper has held the ball for more than eight seconds, and a corner has been awarded to the opponent as a result.\n\nBecause of that success, IFAB will discuss further measures to speed up stoppages in play.\n\nHow would the 'five-second' rule work?\n\nProposals include introducing a new 'five-second rule' for goal-kicks and throw-ins, whereby a player will have only a very short time to get the game back under way again, or face a penalty. If they go beyond the five seconds, the throw-in would be reversed and awarded to the opponent, and a goal-kick would become a corner for the attacking side.\n\nSome insiders have suggested that five seconds is too short a time for players to adhere to, and others fear long throws would be impossible to organise in that time-frame.\n\nSome referees are also likely to be concerned that, if they have to do visual countdowns for goalkeepers with the ball in-hand, and also for throw-ins and goal-kicks, that could cause too much distraction from their other match-ruling functions.\n\nOther laws on the IFAB agenda include the mandatory 30 seconds that a player must remain off the pitch once they have received treatment for an injury on it.\n\nThere is a proposal that this time should be doubled to one minute, to help player welfare, but also to act as a further deterrent to would-be time-wasters. Similarly, a time limit for substitutions could be introduced to try to help further speed up the game.\n\nAgain, the feeling among the home nations FAs seems to be that the 30-second rule for players receiving treatment is working effectively at present, and so there may be some resistance to this law being introduced, we are told.\n\nEach law change, after discussion, will be put to the vote on Saturday. There needs to be a 75 per cent majority for any proposal to be passed. Each of the home nation FAs has one vote each, with FIFA having four votes, meaning six of the eight votes has to be in favour, for a law to be amended."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three away games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on a direct rival. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season.

Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in match-day chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) and sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL translators will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track following a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croatian’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to firstly avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance.

Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge for the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes following the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, could not take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices.

It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThere was a warning for Palace that the tie wasn’t over when Zrinjski had a goal correctly ruled out for offside with 25 minutes still to play. Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

            "content": "The Premier League is to launch its own streaming service, with live coverage of all 380 matches over a season available directly to fans – but only if you live in Singapore.\n\nKnown as Premier League Plus, the new app will be launched before next season and will be the first time match coverage will be sold direct to consumers.\n\nDescribed by the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, as simply being a “learning” opportunity, the move will still cause shockwaves throughout the game as the world’s biggest domestic football league moves to directly control its revenues without the need for a broadcast partner.\n\n“From next season onward, from August, Premier League Plus is going to happen,” Masters said. “For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

But if that’s the case, why not stay here?”\n\nAnnouncing his exit from FC Seoul, Lingard wrote: “This wasn’t an easy decision.

Of course I would.”\n\n4 Neville has had a number of iconic moments on the mic during his 15-year punditry and commentary career Credit: Getty\n\nGoing to the wire\n\nFor the majority of the season, it had looked as if Arsenal were going to run away with the title.\n\nBut they've slipped up at the start of 2026, and Man City are back in the race.\n\nThe Citizens splashed the cash in January on Marc Guehi and Antoine Semenyo.\n\n\n\nThey have made a tangible difference, with City looking like an aggressive and more physical version of older Guardiola sides.\n\nAnd if they pip Arsenal, Alex Crook believes Arteta should leave the Emirates Stadium.\n\nSpeaking on the talkSPORT Daily Podcast, he said: \"If Arsenal don't win the league, I think it will be an incredible failure and I think it'll be on Mikel Arteta. I would go as far as to say he should offer to quit.\n\n\"If they blow the title again... I was watching the Wolves game and they weren't even in the game, Arsenal were strolling around and keeping possession; it was a training match.\n\n\"But there lies the problem - if you're champions elect and 1-0 up after four minutes against probably the worst team the Premier League has ever seen...you go for the jugular.\n\n\n\n\"You get the second goal and get the third goal, get the fourth goal. Goal difference could be vital in the title race.\n\n\"So, to not do that and go back to this safety-first football and put the handbrake on, alright, you do get the second goal, but you invite Wolves back into the game.\n\n\"He's got players there who are more than capable of putting Wolves to the sword, but they're not doing it.\n\n\"They're trying to plod their way to the Championship...if they don't win it... I think Arteta has got to walk away.\""

            "content": "Nottingham Forest's Ryan Yates somehow stayed on the pitch after dislocating his finger against Fenerbahce.\n\nThe game was slightly delayed as the visiting fans launched flares onto the pitch at the City Ground.\n\n2 Yates confirming that the game has not gone\n\nAnd once the game got going, the Forest skipper was soon in a world of pain as he dislocated his finger.\n\n\n\nBut there was no substitution for Yates, who simply popped it back in place and carried on.\n\nIn the end, Forest survived a bit of a scare to seal their place in the Europa League round of 16, winning 4-2 on aggregate and losing 2-1 on the night.\n\nForest were in a good position to reach the last 16 of the Europa League having won the first leg against their Turkish opponents 3-0 last week.\n\nHowever, Vitor Pereira's side found themselves 2-0 down at the City Ground thanks to a Kerem Akturkoglu double, with the second coming from the penalty spot.\n\n\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi stepped off the bench to score a crucial fourth goal in the tie, and Forest will play either Real Betis or Midtjylland in the round of 16.\n\nYates was one of five changes from the narrow 1-0 defeat to Liverpool at the weekend.\n\n\n\nHe came into the team for Ibrahim Sangare, and despite having more than a justified reason to leave the field, he carried on.\n\nThe 28-year-old is the epitome of being a diehard Forest player, having been with the club during some dark times to playing in Europe.\n\n\n\nIt's clear he was not even going to let something as serious as this get him off the field.\n\nEven when he was pointing at his finger, there was no huge cry of pain when he would have every right to be rolling around in agony.\n\nHowever, he was replaced at half time, with Sangare coming on after a really poor first half from the hosts.\n\nYates watched the second half from the bench as they just about it made it to the next stage of the competition.\n\nThey join Aston Villa, who managed to avoid the play-off round by finishing second in the league phase, and the draw takes place on Friday.\n\n\n\n2 Yates doesn't start every game anymore, but he is an important player still\n\nIn the balance\n\nAfter a 3-0 win over Fenerbahce last week in Vitor Pereira's first game in charge, there shouldn't have been any problems this evening.\n\nBut following a short delay for flares being launched onto the pitch, Yates dislocated his finger, and the Turkish giants grabbed the lead.\n\nThe first half performance wasn't good enough from the hosts, and there was a swathe of changes.\n\nSangare, Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina and Igor Jesus all came on.\n\nBut two minutes into the second half, Fenerbahce were awarded a penalty that they scored.\n\n\n\nFrom there, it would have been easy to collapse, but they managed to get the goal they needed.\n\nIt was far from comfortable and Pereira will be concerned about the first-half display, but they can still take confidence into their relegation battle."

            "content": "SIR Keir Starmer is under enormous pressure after Labour came third place at the Gorton and Denton by-election behind the Greens and Reform.\n\nIn a catastrophic blow to the PM, Green candidate Hannah Spencer secured victory with 40.7 per cent of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite being the 39th safest red seat, Reform’s Matt Goodwin earned 28.7 per cent while Sir Keir’s candidate Angeliki Stogia halved the 2024 election vote to 9,364.\n\nTurnout in the by-election was 47.62 per cent and demonstrated a major breakdown of Britain’s traditional two-party system.\n\nThe result has catapulted criticism from left-wing backbenchers that the party isn’t doing enough to attract Muslim and progressive Brits.\n\n\n\nPolling guru Sir John Curtice warned half of Labour MPs could lose their seats to the Greens thanks to today’s results.\n\nIt will embolden the party’s leftie flank who have spent months accusing the PM of being too hardline on immigration and chasing Reform voters.\n\nThe by-election was triggered when former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne quit, having won the seat by 13,000 votes at the 2024 general election.\n\n\n\nGreater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham — a challenger to Sir Keir — tried to stand in the constituency but was blocked by Labour’s ruling executive committee.\n\nMPs immediately started firing off criticisms at the decision, insisting they could’ve won if Mr Burnham stood.\n\nLabour MP Karl Turner blasted: “The reality is we’ve ended up with a situation which we could have avoided.\n\n“It’s the worst result the Labour Party could have ever had, frankly.\n\n“So we are in a position where we can’t out-Left-wing the Greens, we tried to out-Right-wing Reform on immigration, other such matters.”\n\n\n\nRichard Burgon, another MP, added: “Blame for Labour’s defeat lies squarely with Keir Starmer and his clique.\n\n“They put factional interests over having the candidate best placed to win, Andy Burnham.”\n\nThe by-election also points to a meteoric rise in sectarian voting.\n\nAfter his loss Mr Goodwin warned that “we are losing our country”.\n\nHe said: “A dangerous Muslim sectarianism has emerged. We have only one general election left to save Britain.\n\n\n\n“What you saw was a coalition of Islamists and woke progressives that came together to dominate the constituency.”\n\nGorton and Denton by-election will have ramifications for a long time to come ANALYSIS by Noa Hoffman, Political Correspondent Britain woke up to a political earthquake today as the Greens hoovered up thousands of Labour votes to snatch victory at the Gorton and Denton by-election. In what had long been a traditional red stronghold, Sir Keir Starmer’s party was also beaten by Reform. The result tells us plenty about where the country’s politics is heading — and it foreshadows a fight that will be replayed across swathes of constituencies at the next general election. First, the PM’s career is back on the line. Despite riding out a major wobble amid the Mandelson scandal, Labour backbenchers will now feel more emboldened than ever to call time on Starmer’s leadership. They will argue the PM faces a far bigger threat from the left than the right — and that moves to curb immigration and crack down on benefits have ended up punishing the party. Sir Keir’s critics will also point to the loss of thousands of Muslim votes as a warning sign: that Labour isn’t hardline enough on sectarian issues and failed to take a strong stand on Gaza. The result will also lift the prospects of left-wing leadership rivals such as Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham, who will argue their more socialist approach would’ve stopped the party haemorrhaging support in inner-city areas. Gorton and Denton also signals a serious cracking of Britain’s two-party politics. The Tories, for instance, were nowhere to be seen during the campaign and barely scraped 600 votes — a cataclysmic result for the party. Labour’s third-place finish, meanwhile, showed how readily voters will ditch the two main parties for alternatives, underlining deep frustration with the state of the country — and the political status quo. While Reform seized a sizeable chunk of the vote, the result also underlined the power of anti-Nigel Farage tactical voting. There is a huge coalition of voters ready to swing to whichever party they think is best placed to beat Reform. And the by-election also shone a light on a sharp rise in sectarian voting. Throughout the campaign, the Green Party leafleted near mosques and distributed flyers in Urdu. They told Muslim voters to “Labour must be punished for Gaza”. Expect a lot more of this campaigning style in seats with high Muslim populations from here on. The by-election also showed that left-wing populism is emerging as a real force in British politics, as it has been on the right. The Green Party hardly centred environmentalism during their campaign, instead breaking with tradition to focus on issues of immigration and the cost of living.\n\nAfter the contest was rocked by claims of illegal “family voting”, where two people either confer, collude or direct each other on how to cast a ballot, Nigel Farage blasted: “This election was a victory for sectarian voting and cheating.”\n\nIn her victory speech, Ms Spencer said: “Life has changed. Instead of working for a nice life… we’re working to line the pockets of billionaires.\n\n“We are being bled dry.”\n\nGorton and Denton drew attention as a microcosm of Britain and the direction voter demographics are heading in.\n\n\n\nThe constituency was dubbed a “tale of two towns”, with one area largely white and working class, and the other far more ethnically diverse.\n\nMore than a quarter of potential voters are Muslim, with almost a fifth believed to have roots in Pakistan.\n\nKeen to harvest votes from the Muslim population, the Green Party put out election videos and leaflets in Urdu, the national language of Pakistan.\n\nCampaign leaflets carried a photo of Ms Spencer wearing a red and black keffiyeh — a scarf worn by supporters of Palestine — while posing in front of a mosque.\n\nWritten in English, the material includes the words: “Stop Islamophobia. Stop Reform.” And, in Urdu, the leaflet states: “Labour must be punished for Gaza.”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Reform centred its campaign on a call to “get Starmer out”.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nLabour accused both sides of trying to stoke division, pitching itself as the party of unity.\n\nIts campaign leaned heavily on Ms Stogia’s local ties, after more than a decade serving as a councillor."

            "content": "AN AMERICAN man gunned down in the Cuban speedboat shootout was “obsessed” with the country’s freedom, according to his brother.\n\nMichel Ortega Casanova has now been pictured as one of four who were killed by coastguards as they stormed towards the island nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe would-be revolutionaries were allegedly armed with assault rifles and Molotov cocktails.\n\nHavana claimed that the 10 passengers aboard the Florida-registered boat fired shots first, injuring a commander as they were encountered just one nautical mile off the northern coast.\n\nMichel’s brother, Misael, has now shared that his late loved one had lived in the United States for over 20 years, but would still agonise over Cubans’ suffering.\n\n\n\nHe added that his brother was on an obsessive and diabolical quest to secure the country’s freedom.\n\n“They became so obsessed that they didn’t think about the consequences nor their own lives,” Misael said from Miami.\n\nAdding to the heartbreak, the news had caught Michel’s family completely by surprise.\n\nMisael said that he did not recognise a single name on the list of the boat’s occupants released by the Cuban government.\n\n\n\n“No one knew,” Misael said of his brother’s plans. “My mother is devastated.”\n\nHe added that he hopes his brother’s death will be for a worthwhile cause.\n\n“Maybe it will justify that some day Cuba will be free.”\n\nCuban authorities, meanwhile, say Michel was accompanied on the boat by two wanted terrorists, speaking of Amijail Sanchez Gonzalez and Leordan Enrique Cruz Gomez.\n\nOfficials who searched the vessel found assault rifles, handguns, homemade explosives, bulletproof vests, telescopic sights and camouflage uniforms.\n\n\n\nAdding to intrigue, the boat was reported stolen from an island in the Florida Keys archipelago 140 miles (225 kilometres) southwest of Miami, according to a report from the Monroe County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nThe ten occupants were all Cubans who live in the US, according to state media.\n\nCuba’s government said the majority of the boats passengers “have a known history of criminal and violent activity.”\n\n\n\nBut Secretary of State Marco Rubio has vowed the US will “find out exactly what happened” and “respond accordingly.”\n\n“We’re not gonna base our conclusions on what they told us,” he said.\n\nThe passengers were part of a flotilla to get relatives out of Cuba, the New York Times reported.\n\nAn official told the paper it was not a US Navy or Coast Guard vessel.\n\nFlorida’s Attorney General has ordered an investigation into the shooting.\n\n\n\nRepresentative Carlos A. Gimenez – a Republican from Florida – said the shooting raised concerns on the use of lethal force against US registered vessels.\n\nIn a public statement, he called for “an immediate investigation into this massacre”.\n\n“United States authorities must determine whether any of the victims were US citizens or legal residents and establish exactly what occurred.”\n\nThe firefight comes at a perilous moment for Cuba.\n\n\n\nTop officials believe the island’s iron-fisted communist rulers are more exposed than ever, with the economy at its weakest point in decades.\n\nCuba has been hit by skyrocketing prices and oil shortages as a US blockade has taken hold.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nPresident Donald Trump has plotted to entirely blockade the island and eventually topple the communist regime.\n\nLike Venezuela and Iran, he has pushed the regime to cut a deal."

Never Again Fascism.”\n\nAfter the dictator’s 1945 suicide, the Pommer family took over the deed.\n\nSince 1972, the Austrian Ministry of the Interior began leasing the house to protect it from misuse by Neo-Nazis.\n\n\n\nIt has taken on different lives as a city library, a school, and later a disability workshop centre.\n\nThe house stood derelict from 2011 to 2016, but became state property a year later, with the owner reportedly receiving a handsome £700,000 sum.\n\nAuthor Ludwig Laher, a member of the Mauthausen Committee Austria that represents Holocaust victims, blasted the costly conversion.\n\n\n\n“A police station is problematic, as the police… are obliged, in every political system, to protect what the state wants,” he said.\n\nAccording to Laher, a previous idea to turn it into a place where people could discuss peace had received a lot of support.\n\nJasmin Stadler, a 34-year-old shop owner and Braunau native, also slammed the eye-watering money paid.\n\nShe added it would have been interesting to put Hitler’s birth in the house in a “historic context”.\n\nBut others showed support for the redesign.\n\n\n\nWolfgang Leitner, a 57-year-old electrical engineer, said turning it into a police station could help “bring, hopefully, a bit of calm”\n\n“It makes sense to use the building and give it to the police, to the public authorities,” he said.\n\nIt comes as a bonkers 41-year-old neo-Nazi got nicked for hoarding drugs, weapons and Hitler-themed wine in Pinsdorf, an hour south of the Hitler home.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThroughout Austria, debate on how to address the country’s Holocaust history has repeatedly flared.\n\nSome 65,000 Austrian Jews were killed and 130,000 forced into exile during Nazi rule."

By the time you've reached the station, scanned your ticket or Oyster card, gone down the stairs or escalator, waited for your train, then made the return journey back to street level and scanned back out, you could probably have walked the distance just as quickly.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe people at secret.london decided to put this theory to the test, with two people tackling one of the capital's briefest Tube journeys, whilst another made the same trip on foot to determine who'd arrive first.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe journey from Marylebone Station to Baker Street on the Bakerloo line lasts just 57 seconds - however, the time spent getting to and from the platforms, plus waiting for the train, will bump this up. The stations sit just 0.2 miles apart, with the walk between them taking around six minutes, according to Google Maps.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKicking off the video, narrator Tom said: \"This has got to be the most pointless Tube journey in London.\" He continued: \"Today we're racing between Marylebone and Baker Street, with Google predicting a six minute walk versus a one minute Tube ride, who's going to get there first?\"\n\nThe footage then shows Tom and two female colleagues at Marylebone Station simultaneously starting timers on their phones, before he heads off on foot whilst the women dart into the station, reports MyLondon. The footage captures the women striding quickly – but not running – through the station, while navigating the ticket barrier and commuters blocking the escalator.\n\nTom, meanwhile, is filmed making his way through the streets, remarking: \"Of course we're doing it in such terrible weather. You've got to be prepared for everything, so I have come with a brolly.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe continues: \"I'm feeling good about this. Those guys have got to get onto the platform (and) find a tube that's hopefully on time.\"\n\nThe women are then spotted reaching the platform, with the next service due in two minutes, while Tom encounters his \"first obstacle\" – a set of traffic lights. \"A fun fact about Baker Street Station: it's the oldest Tube station in the world,\" he says. \"It was created on January 10 in 1863.\n\n\"But was it built to be the fastest? I don't know.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe women are subsequently shown getting on the train, their timers displaying four minutes and 20 seconds, and counting. \"It's not our fault we're tiny and petite and he's big and lanky and long,\" one remarks.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nThey're then filmed getting off the train and moving swiftly towards the exit. Tom, by contrast, stands across the road from the station entrance.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I can see the entrance to the station and they're not outside it, so I think I've got a good chance\" he says. After a frantic dash up the escalator and a tussle with a stubborn ticket barrier, the women display the timer, reading six minutes and 26 seconds, as they reach the station entrance - only to find Tom already there.\n\nTom finished the journey in six minutes and 16 seconds, remarking: \"So for this one, you probably should walk it.\"\n\nWhat are the shortest Tube journeys?\n\nCharing Cross – Embankment 35 secs (Northern line) Leicester Square – Covent Garden 39 secs (Piccadilly line) Southwark – Waterloo 42 secs (Jubilee line) Tottenham Court Road – Leicester Square 44 secs (Northern line) Holborn – Chancery Lane 45 secs (Central line) Warren Street – Goodge Street 46 secs (Northern line) Cannon Street – Mansion House 50 secs (Circle and Hammersmith & City lines) Cannon Street – Mansion House 50 secs (District line) Embankment – Charing Cross 50 secs (Bakerloo line) Monument – Cannon Street 50 secs (Circle and Hammersmith & City lines) Monument – Cannon Street 50 secs (District line) Marble Arch – Bond Street 51 secs (Central line) Northfields – South Ealing 51 secs (Piccadilly line) Oxford Circus – Tottenham Ct Rd 51 secs (Central line) Charing Cross – Leicester Square 54 secs (Northern line) Euston – King's Cross 54 secs (Victoria line) Finchley Road – Swiss Cottage 55 secs (Jubilee line) Wood Lane – Shepherds Bush 55 secs (Circle and Hammersmith & City lines) Goodge Street – Tottenham Court Road 56 secs (Norther line) Baker Street – Marylebone 57 secs (Bakerloo line) Bond Street – Oxford Circus 57 secs (Central line) Marylebone – Edgware Road 57 secs (Bakerloo line)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

She stormed to victory comfortably taking the seat with 14,980 votes, a majority of 4,402 over Reform's Matt Goodwin. Labour's Angeliki Stogia won 9,364 votes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSome Labour MPs are already blaming Mr Starmer for the defeat by blocking the Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham from standing in the contest earlier this month. In her victory speech an emotional Ms Spencer said: \"I didn't grow up wanting to be a politician. I am a plumber. And two weeks ago during all of this, I also qualified as a plasterer because even in chaos, even under pressure I get things done.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I am no different to every single person here in this constituency.

But now, working hard, what does that get you? Talk to anyone here and they will tell you, the people who work hard can't put food on the table, can't get their kids school uniforms, can't get their heating on, can't live off the pension they've worked hard to save off, can't even begin to dream about ever having a holiday, ever.\n\n\"Because life has changed. Instead of working for a nice life, we're working to line the pockets of billionaires. We are being bled dry. And I don't think it's extreme or radical that working hard should get you a nice life.\n\n\"Clearly I'm not the only person who thinks that because I've made clear my decision and commitment to working class communities - the community I'm from. People in their thousands told me, on the doorstep and at the ballot box, that what we are sick of is being let down and looked down on. That we are sick of our hard work making other people rich.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nMs Spencer also took aim at her election rivals. She continued: \"I won't accept this victory tonight without calling out politicians and divisive figures who constantly scapegoat and blame our communities for all the problems in society.\n\n\"My Muslim friends and neighbours are just like me, human. Now, to my customers, I'm sorry, but I think I might have to cancel the work that you haven't booked in, because I'm heading to Parliament.\n\n\"And when I get there, I will make space for everyone doing jobs like mine, We will finally get a seat at the table.

            "content": "Woman preparing for wedding woke up with her face drooping on one side\n\nCharlie was unable to drink a glass of water or speak without slurring her words\n\nView 5 Images Charlie Beswick pictured one week after her symptoms began\n\nA woman who was preparing for her wedding woke up with her face drooping, unable to drink a glass of water. Charlie Beswick, 47, says as the condition progressed she was unable to speak without slurring - leaving her in a panic.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCharlie, a SEND family and care inclusion consultant, from North Staffordshire, said: “I initially felt terrified that I had had a stroke overnight. I woke up and took a sip of the water at the side of my bed. It instantly dribbled down my chin.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I panicked before grabbing my phone to use the selfie camera, when I noticed my face was really drooped. Andrew and I had waited for eight years to get married on the same date that we met on a blind date.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Charlie Beswick, 10 days into her Bell's Palsy battle\n\n“So the thought of walking down the aisle with a wonky smile terrified me. I'm also the mum of a disabled son and my first thought is often: ‘I can't be ill, what about [him]?’\n\nCharlie’s nightmare began in December 2021 after falling ill with Covid, followed by a double ear infection. Almost overnight, her condition worsened to the point where she was told to go to hospital immediately.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe said: “I rang my sister, who is a nurse and never dramatic. But her reaction was unnerving in itself. She told me to go to hospital immediately.”\n\nThe mum had developed Bell’s Palsy; a weakness or lack of movement that usually affects one side of the face. Signs often include a drooping eyelid or corner of the mouth, drooling, a dry mouth, loss of taste and dry or watering eyes.\n\nView 5 Images Charlie Beswick during her recovery from Bell's Palsy\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile relieved to have a diagnosis, Charlie was faced with another hurdle as medics told her there was a possibility that the effects could become permanent. She said: “I felt very helpless. I was told that the muscles in my face needed to do the work, rather than steroids.\n\n“I was really conscious of my appearance – with and without the eye patch that I'd been advised to wear – and didn’t leave the house for two weeks. I was also utterly exhausted by the smallest thing and was sleeping a lot in the day and at night.”\n\nCharlie was placed on a course of steroid tablets, while a friend bought her a CACI facial treatment course that uses microcurrents to tone facial muscles. The tech - which costs over £600 for a 10 session course - helped her to regain the use of her muscles within four weeks.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe mum, who struggled to “bounce back” from the lasting effects of her condition, also received harsh judgement. She added: “My son is autistic with significant learning needs and has a rare craniofacial condition.\n\nView 5 Images Charlie Beswick on her wedding day in 2022.\n\n“He was born with no eye, eye socket, ear or nostril on his left hand side and a short underdeveloped jaw.

Khawaja Mohammad Asif said the Taliban for turned Afghanistan \"into a colony of India\", amassed militants from around the world and begun \"exporting terrorism\". \"Our patience has now run out. Now it is open war between us,\" he said on X.\n\nPakistan has repeatedly accused neighbouring India of backing the ethnonationalist Baloch Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban - allegations New Delhi denies.\n\nHis declaration comes after Pakistan launched a series of air strikes on the Afghan capital of Kabul, as well as on Kandahar in the south and Paktia province in the southeast. Islamabad says the strikes were in retaliation for Afghan cross-border attacks, saying that two of its soldiers had been killed after an Afghan Taliban operation along their shared border.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Islamabad had hoped for peace in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of NATO forces and expected the Taliban to focus on the welfare of the Afghan people and regional stability, he said.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said his country's forces \"have the full capability to crush any aggressive ambitions\". \"There will be no compromise on the defense of the beloved homeland and every aggression will be met with a befitting reply,\" he said, according to the Pakistani government's X account.\n\nA spokesperson for the Afghan Taliban said in a now-deleted X post that it has responded with renewed attacks against Pakistani troops.\n\nIt is unclear how many casualties each side has suffered as both governments have issued sharply differing claims, saying they inflicted heavy losses on the other.\n\nImage: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAfghanistan's Defence Ministry said overnight that 55 Pakistani soldiers had been killed, including some whose bodies were taken into Afghanistan, and that \"several others were captured alive\". It said eight Afghan soldiers were killed and 11 wounded.\n\nThe ministry said it destroyed 19 Pakistani army posts and two bases and that the fighting ended around midnight, about four hours after it began Thursday. Pakistan's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said two Pakistani soldiers were killed and three wounded. Mosharraf Ali Zaidi, a spokesperson for Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, denied that any Pakistani soldiers had been captured.\n\nIn a post on X, he said at least 133 Afghan fighters were killed and more than 200 wounded. He also said 27 Afghan posts were destroyed and nine fighters captured. He did not specify where the casualties occurred but said additional losses were estimated in strikes on military targets in Kabul, Paktia and Kandahar.\n\nIn Islamabad, two senior security officials said Afghan forces at some border posts had raised white flags, a gesture typically interpreted as a request to halt firing. The officials said Pakistani forces were continuing what they described as a strong retaliatory response to \"unprovoked aggression\" by the Afghan Taliban and had destroyed several key Taliban posts along the border.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Asif also accused the Taliban government of denying Afghans basic human rights, including rights for women that he said are guaranteed under Islam, without providing details or evidence.\n\nImage: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHe said Pakistan had tried to maintain stability both directly and through friendly countries. \"Today, when attempts were made to target Pakistan with aggression, by the grace of God, our armed forces are giving a decisive response,\" he said.\n\nAuthorities in Pakistan said dozens of Afghan refugees who were waiting to return home from the northwestern Torkham border have been taken back to safer places following the eruption of clashes.\n\nPakistan launched a sweeping crackdown in October 2023 to expel migrants without documents, urging those in the country to leave on their own to avoid arrest and forcible deportation, and forcibly expelling others. This prompted millions to cross the border into Afghanistan, including people who were born in Pakistan decades ago and had created businesses there.\n\nLast year alone, 2.9 million people returned to Afghanistan, the U.N. refugee agency has said, with nearly 80,000 having returned so far this year."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren gives verdict on Conor Benn's split from Eddie Hearn - as he refuses to speak on his breakdown in relationship with Saudi backers\n\nFrank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council. A cause of death has not been revealed\n\n'Excellent contender who was so unfortunate to be in the same era as legendary champs like Salvador Sanchez and Alexis Arguello,' one fan wrote on X. 'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure.

Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

The teams are already going head-to-head for Premier League glory and will meet in next month's Carabao Cup final.\n\nCity could have a tough path getting to the quarter-finals, however. They are guaranteed to face a team they met in the group phase of the competition in the last-16.\n\nPep Guardiola's men may have to travel back to Norway to face this season's dark horses, Bodo/Glimt, after the Yellow Ones produced a historic two-legged victory to dump last season's finalists, Inter Milan, out of the competition.\n\nCity already know how difficult a prospect facing Bodo is, after being beaten 3-1 by them in the Arctic Circle in January.\n\nIf not Bodo, then City will face Real Madrid yet again. It would be the fifth straight campaign that the two giants have faced each other in a two-legged tie.\n\nIn their league phase fixture at the Bernabeu, City came from behind to beat Los Blancos 2-1, thanks to goals from Nico O'Reilly and Erling Haaland.\n\nLiverpool face two difficult ties against teams they faced in the league phase. Either Atletico Madrid or Galatasaray await for Arne Slot's Reds.\n\nManchester City beat Real Madrid in the league phase but could face them yet again\n\nThe six-time winners edged past Atletico in their opening fixture of this season's competition, with Virgil van Dijk scoring a stoppage-time header after Marcos Llorente's brace had clawed the Spanish side back level.\n\nHowever, they struggled against their other potential opponents Galatasaray, losing 1-0 in the intimidating RAMS Park.\n\nTottenham have the same two potential opponents as Liverpool, with Igor Tudor's team set to face either Atletico or Galatasaray in the round of 16.\n\n\n\nWin that tie, and Spurs could possibly face Chelsea or Newcastle in the quarter-finals."

            "content": "The look was perfect. Emile Heskey wore it so well, that strange cocktail of exasperated indignation. You’re asking me about Erling Haaland? Ah, come on.\n\nHeskey, sat on upholstered leather to bring an air of authority to proceedings – those proceedings being to goad an ex-professional into saying something inflammatory on video for social media, all in the name of betting advertising – briefly weighed up the question of whether Haaland is 'world class'.\n\nHe answered 'no' and then the edited footage cuts to the former Liverpool striker explaining why, presumably to somebody who raised surprise in an action that now had him all of a fluster. ‘World class? Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals. Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals.’\n\nHeskey knows a thing or two about goals of course, having registered one in five games at club level and one in nine for England during a career that saw him clean up at Birmingham City’s Player of the Year Awards in 2005.\n\nThese days he spends a bit of his time flogging CBD online but here we are instead focusing on his suggestion that Haaland is selling snake oil to anybody who thinks he’s an elite striker.\n\nHeskey’s sons, Jaden and Reigan, are both products of Manchester City’s academy and have regularly trained alongside Haaland, so are perhaps in a better position to determine the 25-year-old record-breaker’s skillset from the perspective of somebody who has seen him close up.\n\nErling Haaland chases down the ball against Newcastle last Saturday during a dynamic display in which he had his most touches yet in a Premier League match, at 43\n\nHaaland set up Nico O'Reilly for City's second goal. The Norwegian has three assists since City's formation switch\n\nTheir old man’s game was predicated on doing the donkey work, allowing others to grab headlines. He did this expertly by bringing midfielders into play, occupying defenders, creating channels for others, generally enjoying the physicality of the Premier League.\n\nThat description does bring a man to mind, actually. Long hair, Scandinavian. Fastest ever to 100 Premier League goals. Second in this year’s assist charts with seven, behind only Bruno Fernandes. Part of a leadership team handpicked by the great Pep Guardiola. Seems like a full package. World class, you might say.\n\nDiscussion around what Haaland does or does not do came back round last weekend, when City squeezed past Newcastle United. The best all-round performance of his career has been the shout from a section of observers and Wayne Rooney gushed over the nature of it. ‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ Guardiola said, having already held Haaland up as an example to his team-mates in the dressing room after the 2-1 victory.\n\nBasically the message was to remember what he put in for the cause, the commitment and desire, the sort of which is non-negotiable if City are to beat Arsenal to this title.\n\nHaaland ran, defended, hustled like a man possessed. He bundled Dan Burn about as if the giant defender was a rookie on the slight side. There he was, heading away a dangerous corner in the dying seconds. He didn’t score but assisted beautifully for Nico O’Reilly’s second, standing up a right-foot cross to the back post. Haaland admired it as O’Reilly headed in before darting off to celebrate with the scorer.\n\n‘You can see his joy when other people succeed,’ Norway head coach Stale Solbakken has told Daily Mail Sport. ‘That is big proof of what a team player he is.’ Some City players have been somewhat surprised by his collegiate attitude over the years; that attribute is partly why Guardiola handed him more responsibility last summer.\n\nHis numbers against Newcastle paint a picture. A career-high 12 duels. His most touches in a Premier League match, at 43. No City player completed more clearances, albeit that is dependent on which source and what they determine a clearance to be.\n\nHis average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush, which is a product of Guardiola going with two up front and a box midfield in recent weeks. ‘We’ll see what we do when the wingers (Jeremy Doku and Savinho) are back,’ the City manager said. ‘I think he adapted perfectly. I’m not telling Erling to play left back.’\n\nIt’s no coincidence that Haaland has three assists since the formation switch and is now only one from his league-best tally.\n\n‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ City manager Pep Guardiola said of Haaland's efforts against Newcastle\n\nHaaland's average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush (Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki and Abdukodir Khusanov were all substitutes)\n\nThese bits are significant indicators of a complete centre forward, more Harry Kane than Cristiano Ronaldo. And it is a trend. The conversations around how Haaland’s game has been transformed, doing more for the team and not ‘just’ scoring an inordinate number of goals, have now surfaced at least four times this season.\n\nThe draw at Arsenal. Beating United in September’s derby – before which Haaland was a central figure in a team meeting about raising standards and when he completed more defensive actions than that Newcastle match. And after a home win against Bournemouth. Each display prompted discourse about his style, the sort of which that has that guy at the end of the bar earnestly offering that Haaland’s not just about goals anymore, you know.\n\nThat this talk about an improvement outside of his recognised zone, between the posts, happens periodically and presented as new begs the question: has he actually always been like this?\n\nThe answer is yes and no, although it certainly looks to the naked eye that he has grown into a main character of City’s build-up play. And often that is more instructive than the raw stats. Heading and City relying upon his size is the main upturn – and a drastic one. This has been an area that Haaland’s worked on for a long while, particularly with Marco Rose at Borussia Dortmund, and one he knew needed elevating.\n\nWhile the number of aerial duels he battles in is only up marginally per 90 minutes, 3.9 now compared to 3.55 last year and 3.2 during his first season, City are seeing far better results. Haaland now wins 64 per cent of those, up from an average of around 50.\n\nHis dribbling statistics are on an upward curve, one deft slalom against Newcastle given the slow-motion treatment by City’s video team this week. He takes on more of those per game and completes 40 per cent.\n\nBut then there are the others. Winning back possession in the final third is better than last year but not as prevalent as in 2023-24. Passes played into the box is half of the Treble year. Expected assists are broadly the same as his other three campaigns, chances created from open play are actually lower than ever - even if through-balls are now far higher than his normal average.\n\nAverage number of touches – the metric that detractors became obsessed by – are lower than his first two seasons, 24 now and 27 in that blistering first term when plenty mocked his lack of general involvement. But this takes into account the whole season, not just the period that City have been wingerless. Anyway, it's a funny old game. He’d not felt the ball once before a 15th-minute opener in Monaco and nobody mentioned it.\n\nHaaland is now winning far more of his aerial duels: 64 per cent up from an average of around 50\n\nHaaland's stats for winning back possession in the final third are better than last year\n\nOften the sheer weight of goals distract from everything else and perhaps the amazement of those feats wearing off has seen pundits look for other things in his game to highlight.\n\nCertainly working for the team is nothing new, Haaland particularly pleased with a decoy run to distract Juan Foyth, allowing Bernardo Silva to score, away at Villarreal in October as a recent example, even if dropping deep is.\n\nRoughing up William Saliba and Gabriel in the 2023 title showdown with Arsenal is a memorable display of force and doing the dirty stuff, while Norway marvelled at the way he pressed, ran channels and held up possession as they secured a vital World Cup qualification win over Italy in June.\n\nTactically, they are seeing him have a greater awareness of what is required, especially against supposedly superior opposition. And that is maybe where this year’s difference comes: the statistics are similar but it’s learning how best to utilise those opportunities to the betterment of players around him.\n\nEven as the league’s top scorer on 22, there have been struggles. A barren spell in front of goal either side of new year is being worked through and he is still not entirely out of that yet. Coming out of the dressing room at Anfield in his sliders, Haaland insisted there was ‘no excuse’ for his form and he has still only scored one from open play in his last 10 league games.\n\nHe has refused to put this down to fatigue, even if Guardiola has labelled him ‘exhausted’ and attempted to give rest where possible, Haaland benched for victory over Wolves last month. Haaland is between houses at the moment, the family temporarily moving down near Crewe, and spent some of his three days off after Newcastle in Paris.\n\nLeeds United next, the city of his birth, as the first half of the run-in starts motoring. City undoubtedly need him to start scoring regularly now and Guardiola has spoken candidly about the pressures the club’s No 9 places upon himself.\n\nHaaland celebrates scoring against Fulham with Phil Foden but he only has one goal from open play in his last 10 league games\n\n'The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola says. ‘We won the Treble because he scored I don’t know how many goals'\n\n‘The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola said. ‘That is the challenge for him. When your expectation is five goals a season, you can improve. We won the Treble because he arrived, he scored I don’t know how many goals (52), and the expectations are there.\n\n‘When you go four or five games without scoring, it is like “Oh what happened, what happened?” He puts a lot of responsibility on himself. He is a guy who desperately wants to help the team and the club. I always say to him not to put too much pressure (on himself).\n\n‘He knows how much we need him, he doesn’t want to leave the team disappointed. That is a big attribute. I would prefer that to somebody who doesn’t care. He’s completely the opposite, he suffers when he doesn’t score a goal. Don’t suffer, you do your best.’\n\nThe best will never be enough for some."

            "content": "It was an outcome which would never have been foretold among those whose mission is now persuading a digital generation to click on BBC Sport’s output rather than someone else’s TikTok or YouTube content.\n\nA peak audience of 5.5million people in the UK were glued to that old-fashioned concept called BBC1 last week, as they watched the Team GB men’s curling final.\n\nIt’s demode to say it, but many will have done so while communing around a TV. Countless had become armchair curling experts amid two beautiful weeks of Winter Olympics. The BBC broadcasts of the Games had 26.3million viewers in all.\n\nIt’s not the only time lately when that experience of tuning in to something transcending clicks and instant gratification was to be found on the BBC. Against a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January.\n\nThe ensuing digital clips were fine – bandaged captain Paul Dawson leaping to score and sending the roof off that modest stadium – but it was the unfolding match, the national suspense, the collective willing-on of the underdogs, the excellent Mark Chapman’s half-time talk with the Macclesfield manager’s brother, Wayne Rooney – which made it so fine and compelling.\n\nSport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities. Sport as we had once come to expect it from the broadcaster which takes our licence fee.\n\nThe BBC's Winter Olympics coverage showed sport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities... not merely social media clips\n\nAgainst a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January\n\nThe media landscape is changing at a mesmerising pace. The BBC, in the throes of existential crisis, are facing the financial challenge of streaming platforms which are making the commercial battle for live sport extremely competitive.\n\nBut it was not just those of us brought up on the live football commentary of John Motson, Barry Davies and the great Hugh Johns whose hearts were heavy when hearing the BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski tell the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant.\n\n‘We’re not competing against who we were competing with before,’ he said. ‘The BBC might have thought, traditionally, it was up against ITV, or Sky, or other broadcasters. Well, guess what? We’re not. We’re in a race to not be swiped. Up against people selling you holidays, or clothes companies, or two-for-one chicken breasts on sale from the supermarket, or football teams, or athletes.\n\n‘We still have reporting and live pages and digital video that draw in millions and millions and millions of people. You can still be relevant - you can still matter - if you don’t show the sport.’\n\nBBC Sport’s need for intellectual curiosity and imagination in a complicated media landscape extending far beyond outside broadcasts is undeniable. All in the industry are facing the same challenge. Clips are certainly working for them in terms of Premier League, Champions League and cricket coverage.\n\nBut it was what Kay-Jelski didn’t say, as well as his bleak and provocative suggestion that the BBC’s sports output is competing with poultry purveyors, which reinforced the sense that the national broadcaster have given up on live sport, in their pursuit of digital clicks.\n\nWhat you really wanted to hear was that BBC Sport are fighting for their lives to hold on to the rights of sports held dearest by the British public, in the face of aggressive streamers who want to monetise them. That the list of televised sport's free-to-air ‘crown jewels’ must, as a matter of national significance, be extended to preserve them for those who cannot or will not pay for an ever-growing number of commercial bolt-ons.\n\nA group of MPs have let it be known that they are supportive of such an extension. Here was some momentum to seize on. On all of the above, we heard nothing.\n\nThe BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski told the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant\n\nSome broadcast staff in the BBC’s Six Nations coverage, already split with ITV, are thought to be wondering how secure the future looks. Wimbledon five years from now? Who knows?\n\nThe Boat Race is the most recent live sport event lost from the BBC, with word coming down last autumn that the corporation had ‘fallen out of love’ with it. Granted, not an event guaranteed to feed the clips or ‘second screen’ culture. But one which is still held in huge national affection, with a 2.6million viewership.\n\nThe event, enthusiastically picked up by Channel 4, has now gone the same way as the Grand National, The Open, Test cricket, the Paralympics and Royal Ascot. Each of those pillars of British sport came with the licence fee in the early 1990s. No more.\n\nThis summer will see the Commonwealth Games not staged on the BBC for the first time – a disaster for organisers involved in their own fight for relevance. The Games have been picked up by TNT Sports.\n\nThat’s the same broadcaster whose low-rent coverage of the Ashes this winter was encapsulated by commentator Rob Hatch mistaking a replay of Jamie Smith's run-out as a live wicket and excitedly announcing that Ben Stokes had been dismissed.\n\nIn December, my colleague Mike Keegan’s reporting provided a graphic sense of how the BBC’s pivot to digital content, and the 16-24-year-old demographic it craves, is being viewed by staffers who believe in the concept of covering sports news on TV. His report related how a Q&A session with senior management, called a ‘culture cafe’ became a ‘slanging match’ at times.\n\nIt also highlighted how, in the same pursuit of the digital traffic, BBC Sport have recruited dedicated correspondents for Liverpool, Newcastle United, Chelsea and the Manchester clubs, as well as a ‘football tactics correspondent’ and a ‘football issues correspondent'. Chasing online audiences which the nation’s big clubs bring does not cohere with a Royal Charter which that states the BBC should be for everyone.\n\nKay-Jelski’s words this week suggested that he is fine with facing down the criticism. ‘It’s OK if a lot of these innovations don’t make everybody happy,’ he said. ‘It’s also OK if some of the traditional forms of its media content or sporting content don’t make people happy.’\n\nHow long before Wimbledon joins Sue Barker in departing our free-to-air screens?\n\nBut for two weeks this month, we were reminded that linear TV is not dead, as we sat together in front of the box in the corner of the room and watched skiers and snowboarders and skaters fly in northern Italy.\n\nWe witnessed the extraordinary outcome when BBC Sport commentators, editors, engineers and studio staff cohere. We were reminded of the understated brilliance of Hazel Irvine, one of the nation’s very best sports presenters.\n\nAnd it was all ours to view, for free. The very best of our licence fee.\n\nMy friend bought his young kids a carpet curling kit and says they were so besotted that they practised every day of the Games. Such is the wonder and absorption that live sport brings. You don’t fall in love with clips."

            "content": "How Harry Brook became a true leader: The more mature attitude to booze, his blossoming union with Brendon McCullum, the Jacob Bethell bond, a crucial mentor and how he's won his team-mates' respect\n\nUnlock more of the best of our cricket coverage with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nEarlier this week, before his devastating hundred hurtled England into the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, Harry Brook sauntered into a press conference, clocked the facial expressions of those present and suggested a smile or two wouldn’t go amiss.\n\nNaturally, there have been times during what has been the most harrowing of winters for Brook that facing questions from the media was the last thing he wanted to do. But the jovial nature of that entrance in Pallekele here in Sri Lanka told of his desire to move on and embrace the next chapter of his England captaincy.\n\nThere is no doubt that he is in a much happier place since this World Cup began, despite the revelations on its eve that he lied about being alone on the Halloween night out that ended with him being struck by a Wellington bouncer.\n\nThere is an irony here, because without the Yorkshireman’s honest testimony - coming clean to England coach Brendon McCullum during the final one-day international at Wellington's Sky Stadium on November 1 - there is a chance the episode might never have come out.\n\nFor the original story entered the public domain during England’s Ashes tour not because of the incident itself, but the fact he’d been reprimanded and fined £30,000 by his ECB bosses as a result. Equally, it was loyalty to team-mates Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue that led Brook, in taking responsibility and apologising for his own actions, to say that he had been on his own.\n\nNot great optics, some will argue, and it led to further scrutiny from the outside world in the form of an ongoing investigation by the Cricket Regulator. But it has arguably strengthened Brook’s standing within the England dressing room - other players respect him. And they are increasingly his players.\n\nHarry Brook's attempts to protect his team-mates have strengthened his standing within the England dressing room\n\nBrook points to the heavens in memory of his grandmother Pauline after reaching his 50-ball hundred in Pallekele on Tuesday\n\nOver the course of his 10-month tenure, Brook’s influence on selection has shown itself with the recalls of Will Jacks and Tom Banton, two of his former England Under 19s team-mates, even if another close friend in Brydon Carse has fallen by the wayside.\n\nJacks has found himself in a new role at No 7, while Brook confessed at the start of this tournament that he did not necessarily have a specific position for Banton, just that he knew he wanted him in his first-choice XI. Liam Dawson was recalled from the international wilderness at the start of last summer. Surrounding himself with old friends, people with whom he shares mutual trust, has had the desired effect on and off the field.\n\nA strong bond has developed with Bethell, the team’s unofficial vice-captain and whose adventurous nature led to walks together through leafy Kandy, seeking out the best coffee shops.\n\nAway from the game, Brook lost his grandmother Pauline - whom he called his ‘rock’ - two years ago this month. She was someone who in typical Yorkshire style told him how things were. Berated him for bad shots. Or poor choices. Loved him unconditionally. Poignantly, he looked to the heavens in her memory when he reached three figures in Pallekele.\n\nGuidance more recently has come from his manager Phil Weston, the former Worcestershire and Gloucestershire player, whom he acknowledged has been an ‘amazing’ support as trouble shadowed him these past few months.\n\nBrook’s mum, Lucy, has been around too and was present for his 27th birthday last Sunday, including a 'cake smash' after victory over the tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, in which Bethell appeared to take great delight in the smearing of sponge and cream into the England captain’s face.\n\nThat took place at the team hotel in Kandy where two nights later in the bar, a posse of England players, mingling happily with fans, raised glasses to the 100 that had downed Pakistan by two wickets - booking the first ticket to the final four in the process.\n\nThere is a time and a place for such things, of course, and no one would be so prudish as to deny them a chance to celebrate success three nights before what is for England a dead-rubber against New Zealand on Friday.\n\nEngland are operating to a self-imposed curfew of midnight on non-matchdays during this tournament, but there has been no need for an alcohol ban, just a much more mature approach to its consumption in the light of an Ashes dogged by forensic examination of boozy incidents.\n\nBrook smashes a straight six on the way to his 50-ball century against Pakistan\n\nWill Jacks congratulates Brook on his ton. Brook wanted Jacks in the team and the all-rounder's presence is a sign of the captain's growing influence on selection\n\nFor one, there is not much opportunity for nights out in a World Cup schedule that has generally been travel, practice, play, repeat. Although they did stop off in Colombo in transit from Kolkata to Kandy last week, allowing a group of 20 and 30-somethings to act like 20s and 30-something men and enjoy some downtime.\n\nGolf and padel have been on the agenda, but watching Brook’s mastery of the Pakistan bowling attack on Tuesday was a reminder that to him cricket always comes first.\n\nMultiple publishers were interested in Brook writing a book this winter, charting a rise from West Yorkshire village club Burley-in-Wharfedale to a Test batsman averaging mid-50s, but he postponed it, citing a desire to retain full focus on England’s tour Down Under.\n\nSince resuming his limited-overs captaincy, he has orchestrated five wins out of six in bilateral matches here in Sri Lanka - using the defence of just 128 in the final T20 as a reference point during team meetings for maintaining a never-say-die-attitude at this tournament.\n\nImprovements have been noticeable both in terms of tactics and temperament: an instinct call to open the bowling with Jacks despite a competition economy rate touching 14 rushed the Sri Lankans to Super Eight defeat last weekend, while slowing his bowlers down between deliveries to regain composure proved a crucial factor in the last-ball thriller versus Nepal. Pre-match chats have not altered, with input from Brook and Brendon McCullum bookending thoughts from the floor.\n\nBut several members of the squad have reflected on the increasingly symbiotic relationship of Brook and McCullum, which would bode well for the future if the New Zealander were secure in his position.\n\nHowever, the threat of post-Ashes change coincides with Ben Stokes being assigned a ‘coaching’ role with England Lions in the UAE, effectively increasing contact time with Andrew Flintoff following their partnership at Northern Superchargers last August. Such arrangements might just be coincidence, of course.\n\nBrook calls McCullum the best coach he’s known, and immediately credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy the Pakistan attack.\n\nBrook calls England coach Brendon McCullum the best he’s known and credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy Pakistan\n\nLike Ben Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect on Brook\n\nThose close to him joke that Brook wears his intelligence lightly - Joe Root playfully dubbed him an 'idiot' last year. Yet his cricketing smarts are there for all to see.\n\nTake that 50-ball hundred when in conjunction with Sam Curran and Jacks - fellow gym bunnies - the Pakistanis were run ragged on Pallekele’s huge expanses, conceding nine twos in addition to Brook’s 14 boundaries. He later joked that his 2023 self would have carried too much timber to have seen through the plan.\n\nLike Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect, even if there are blips - like the too-close-to-the-bone Stone Cold Steve Austin beer slam celebration marking his one-day hundred here in Colombo last month.\n\nThe thousands of supporters that flocked to Australia did so in the hope of witnessing such hundreds there, not brain fades that gifted his wicket away.\n\n\n\nBut hope remains that his first truly match-defining international innings can raise smiles until what is the very latest point on England’s winter schedule - the final in Ahmedabad a week on Saturday - seeing him emulate Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler as World Cup-winning captains."

            "content": "Arsenal have picked up an unhealthy habit in 2026. Self-destruction.\n\nIf that seems a little harsh on a team currently five points clear at the top of the Premier League, consider that they are second in another table.\n\nOnly rivals Tottenham have conceded more goals from errors this calendar year (five to Arsenal's four), with a streak of costly lapses threatening to undermine the Gunners' momentum.\n\nHad it not been for the emphatic 4–1 scoreline against Spurs last weekend, this dangerous pattern might already have been laid bare. Instead, the winning margin that day masked an issue which has been lingering in the background.\n\nOn Sunday, Declan Rice was the culprit, uncharacteristically giving the ball away to Randal Kolo Muani outside of the area, ahead of the Frenchman's equaliser.\n\nComing from a man who has been so dependable for Arsenal all season long, the error felt significant.\n\nArsenal players have made four errors leading to goals in 2026, with Declan Rice (left) at fault for Tottenham's equaliser on Sunday\n\nIt's a problem Mikel Arteta needs to solve soon, with the title race decided by such fine margins\n\nPlayers are human, of course. Mistakes can happen. But when it becomes concerning is when a trend emerges.\n\nBetween their opening match of the season against Manchester United on August 17 and December 31, the Gunners made just one mistake that directly led to a goal — the fewest across the league, and a testament to their brilliant defensive record.\n\nThat error came when Martin Zubimendi was tackled in the build-up to Richarlison’s consolation goal against Spurs in November.\n\nIt was an isolated lapse, and the big question at the time was whether Arsenal could break Chelsea’s 2004-05 record of conceding just 15 goals in a single campaign. But since the turn of the year, cracks have begun to show.\n\nRice’s misstep was merely the latest in a sequence of self-inflicted wounds: against Bournemouth, Gabriel’s defensive lapse was ruthlessly punished by Evanilson; versus Manchester United, Zubimendi was caught out and Bryan Mbeumo capitalised.\n\nAnd in the meeting with Wolves, confusion between Gabriel and David Raya in the area allowed Tom Edozie to convert a stoppage-time equaliser, with his strike rebounding off Riccardo Calafiori and into the net.\n\nTo make matters worse, title rivals Manchester City are yet to concede a single goal due to an individual error in 2026. The contrast couldn't be starker.\n\nThe margins are razor-thin at the top, yet the Gunners are being hurt by their own avoidable mistakes.\n\nThese are not systemic defensive collapses, nor tactical breakdowns. They are concentration lapses, moments that elite sides simply cannot afford, and point towards a psychological battle amid the rising pressure of trying to win the club's first Premier League title in over 20 years.\n\nMartin Zubimendi feels the heat after gifting Manchester United a goal at the Emirates last month. Arsenal went on to lose the game 3-2\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh earned 20 caps for Northern Ireland and played for Tottenham and Norwich.\n\nHaving seen both sides of the equation, he is clear on how pressure will be affecting the Arsenal players’ mental psyche.\n\nMcVeigh told Daily Mail Sport: ‘When players are in the zone, they call it being in a flow state. This is when players perform at their best because they're not thinking about it. It allows the muscles in their frame for years and years to be able to perform and not even think about it.\n\n‘But once players are aware (of the pressure), it becomes more and more important. And of course, it's very difficult to stop thinking about it now that you're in the zone.\n\n‘This group of players (at Arsenal) have come close and fallen away quite a lot of times over the last few years, so it is very difficult to stay in the subconscious.\n\n‘The players who have won league titles, like the Manchester City players, who have done it a number of times over the last five years, they have the experience of getting over the line.\n\n‘So they might have different strategies they can use. The majority of the Arsenal team, however, don’t know how to navigate the situation of being in a title race, and the Arsenal fans are expecting them to throw it away.’\n\nThe culprits of these errors are seasoned players at the top of their games, the mistakes coinciding with a tide of expectation which has continued to build from the outside.\n\nThat his given opposition teams, even as lowly as Wolves, a glimmer of hope in matches which Arsenal fail to kill off.\n\nMikel Arteta’s men are no longer suffocating games once they gain control. Instead, they are offering opponents moments, small windows that top-flight forwards can exploit.\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh played over 200 games for Norwich. He insists Arsenal's near-misses in previous Premier League seasons will have taken a toll\n\nA loose pass in midfield or a split-second of indecision at the back each carries amplified consequence in a title race defined by the smallest of details.\n\nIt is this slight vulnerability which has prevented the north London club being at least eight points clear at the top — had they beaten Wolves and drawn with Manchester United — instead of just five. In that scenario, the title race would have felt an awful lot more settled than it does now.\n\nMcVeigh, who wrote a book titled It’s Not About You: The Psychology of Leadership featuring an interview with Robert Pires, played against the 2004 Invincibles side when he was at Norwich. That team is incomparable to the current Arsenal side in his eyes.\n\n‘I don't think there's any comparison at all,’ he explained. ‘The team I played against were almost superhuman.\n\n‘When I was playing (against them), not only did Thierry Henry not have to run with the ball at his feet, he was walking with it, as if to say, “Don't come near me because if you do, I'm going to embarrass you”.\n\n‘And so I took him at his word and I didn't go near him, I kept backing off. The difference is, there was a supreme confidence and inner belief that team, especially personified by Thierry Henry, were going to win.\n\n‘By that stage, Henry, Patrick Vieira, Pires, all these guys were World Cup winners, absolute serial winners, and they were all coming together with another group of players in that team who had all won significant prizes. That is the massive difference.’\n\nA stoppage-time mix-up between Gabriel and David Raya at Wolves last week saw the Gunners drop two points to the league's bottom side\n\nThe good news for Arteta is that the issue can be fixed. In terms of what Arsenal can do to cope with pressure and iron out mistakes, McVeigh added: ‘They could be doing things like visualisation, affirmations, setting goals, psycholinguistics, working as a group and having discussions on all of this. There's so many different things.\n\n‘Whether players are actually good at this, working on their psychology, I would highly doubt. In my 30 years in professional football, I would say less than one per cent of people in professional football utilised sports psychology, which for me is just an absolute crutch.\n\n‘They (Arsenal) have sports psychologists. The difference is, does anyone actually use them? That's always the question: how much trust does a player have in a psychologist that the club provides? Potentially, the player might doubt that there's going to be complete trust between them and the psychologist.\n\n‘The psychologist could be having conversations with the manager, which is always the difference. It is why, even as a player, you might struggle a little bit (to trust them).’\n\nDespite some of the recent errors, it is not as though Arsenal’s defence is meek or weak. From August through December, their remarkable solidity was the backbone of their good form, with their backline the envy of Europe.\n\nA fearsome centre-back partnership of Gabriel and William Saliba, aided by defensively sound full backs in the shape of Jurrien Timber and either Calafiori or Piero Hincapie, is a mean defence on paper.\n\nWhen asked about why his team were conceding such few goals earlier in the season, Arteta replied: ‘The right level of organisation, but especially with the desire to play, shown every day, and the commitment that they show to do all the duties necessary for us to be a team that is very difficult to play against and to score against.’\n\nHe views defending as an element the whole team has to buy into, a non-negotiable even.\n\nDefending is something Arteta wants his whole team to buy into. Will his side be able to restore their superb record before the season is out?\n\nSince January, that sharpness has dulled just enough to tilt tight contests in the wrong direction. Arsenal have conceded eight goals across nine league games in 2026. Before the turn of the year, it was 13 conceded across 19 games.\n\nThe nine-match sample so far this year includes conceding two goals each against bottom-placed Wolves and mid-table Bournemouth, as well as shipping three at home to United. Clean sheets have given way to recovery jobs, and authority has been replaced by anxiety.\n\nThe data shows a rise in goals conceded, but the eye test reveals hesitation where there was once conviction. And at this level, hesitation is costly.\n\nIf Arsenal are to go the distance, the mistakes must stop — and immediately."

            "content": "Sheffield Wednesday... here is why Mike Ashley is NOT the worst owner to steer the ship while in severe peril, writes CRAIG HOPE\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nMike Ashley is not the worst owner. Now there is a statement that would have once raised eyebrows, if not fists, on Tyneside.\n\nA black and white might have left you black and blue for daring to be so antagonistic. Yet, for Sheffield Wednesday, there is a grain of hope in that thought.\n\nFor Ashley to make a success of any investment — you can measure that in pounds and pence — his football club needs to function, albeit dysfunctionally. It is not in the interest of him nor the brands whose colours will soil the club for it to drop down the pyramid and be run into the ground.\n\nThink of the two seasons when he showed most interest and ambition at Newcastle — they were both in the Championship. The first time, in 2009/10, he funded the pay packets of Nicky Butt, Alan Smith, Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and Andy Carroll and his team amassed 102 points as champions. Seven years later and the stardust was in the dugout in the form of Rafa Benitez. Again, they won the league. Not every club relegated from the Premier League has an owner so desperate to take them back to the top flight, even if the motivation was self-interest. Once back in the top flight, however, the aspiration did not extend far beyond keeping the billboard prominent.\n\nIf Ashley is to get involved with Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure. That, for them, is no bad thing given their current plight. Supporters might have to hold their nose — and close their eyes to avoid the red and blue — but Ashley’s scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his primary goal.\n\nHis attitude to football changed the day his family were verbally abused when Newcastle were relegated at Villa Park in 2009, two years after he had bought the club. As one source told us when Ashley finally sold Newcastle to a Saudi-backed consortium in 2021: ‘The club became about maximising brand exposure for Sports Direct at the expense of on-field ambition. He had an attitude of, “All noise is good noise”.\n\nIf Mike Ashley (left) is to get involved with Sheffield Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure\n\nAshley scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his main goal\n\n‘A lot of the stunts he pulled were exactly that — renaming the stadium, branding all over the ground, he knew the publicity it would generate.\n\n‘If the team did well at the same time then great, but he wasn’t going to invest his own money chasing the top four, the margins didn’t add up. Instead, it was about making the club self-sufficient, making a profit on player sales and staying in the Premier League to keep Sports Direct prominent.’\n\nAshley likes distressed assets and will sense an opportunity at Hillsborough. Not to be the altruistic white knight, more so the dark horse with cold-eyed intent. But when the starting line is League One and the threat of extinction, the 61-year-old is not necessarily a bad bet. He has ridden a similar track before, given the big-club heritage of Newcastle, iconic home and invested fanbase. He will know some of the shortcuts to accelerate the journey.\n\nAs for the destination, the comfort for supporters is that it should be a better place than where they find themselves.\n\nAshley does not want to see a team bounce around League One. The detail might well be in the retail, but that is the price on the ticket if he is to swoop in and rescue the club. He would certainly generate interest.\n\n\n\nHere is one story that captures the maverick of the man. During a meeting with Sports Direct senior managers, he gave them all a playing card. Ashley had a deck and started turning over cards from the top. The first to match was a store boss from Teesside, and Ashley gave him the keys to a new Ferrari Spider. It is rarely dull around Ashley. Buckle up, Sheffield Wednesday."

He signed a £6.5m-a-year deal until June 2027, meaning his pay-off for the remainder of his contract is around £10.05m.\n\nThe club had already splashed out £14.5m following the sacking of Erik ten Hag and departure of sporting director Dan Ashworth.\n\nShould they be forced to compensate Amorim and his staff in full, it will take the total United have spent on sacking managers and executives to nearly £30m in just 15 months.\n\nAmorim left United the day after an explosive press conference following the 1-1 draw with Leeds, where he openly criticised club bosses. He clashed with Wilcox in a meeting three days before the trip to Elland Road.\n\nUnited took the decision amid concerns the team could fail to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nAmorim was replaced on an interim basis by Darren Fletcher before the club appointed Michael Carrick, who has won five and drawn one of his six games in charge to boost United's chances of returning to European football's top table.\n\nThe Red Devils are fourth having won the most points - 18 - of any Premier League team this calendar year.\n\nThe top five in the Premier League will secure a Champions League place next season and United are three points clear of Liverpool in sixth.\n\nAmorim won only 25 of his 63 games in charge and finished 15th in the Premier League before losing the Europa League final to Tottenham in May."

            "content": "Right when they needed them, Crystal Palace's players stepped up as Oliver Glasner's side kept their European dream alive on a huge night at Selhurst Park.\n\nMaxence Lacroix’s first-half header looked to have been decisive for Palace, but after some nervy moments, Evann Guessand confirmed the victory in injury-time to knock out their plucky Bosnian opponents Zrinjski Mostar.\n\n'It was a good and important win,' Glasner said post-match. 'We learned the lessons from the away leg, controlled the game and waited for the moments.\n\n'Not everything is perfect, but we can see the players are feeling better in the way we are playing.'\n\nThere was no doubt this was the biggest night of the Eagles' season given the way their campaign has started to unravel since Glasner announced in January that he would be leaving this summer.\n\n2025-26 had promised so much, but an end to the European journey in February, regardless of the acrimony that has followed the Austrian in recent weeks, would’ve been a disaster.\n\nCrystal Palace dispatched Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to reach the UEFA Conference League last 16\n\nEvann Guessand's 93rd-minute strike followed Maxence Lacroix's first-half header\n\nIt is easy to forget that it is just over two months since Palace, not long off a club record unbeaten run, were in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and about to enter the FA Cup as holders, but such has been the collapse in their form that this felt enormous.\n\nThat jeopardy was added to by Zrinjski manager Igor Stimac, once of West Ham and Derby.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference, he called out Palace's board for a 'lack of ambition', spoke about their weaknesses, and expressed a desire to add to his own history against the club. Stimac was at Derby when they beat the Eagles to gain promotion to the Premier League in 1996.\n\nYet despite the recent chaos that has engulfed Palace and the breakdown in relationship between the fans and Glasner as a result of his repeated public outbursts, the home supporters roared their side on from before kick-off and this was a night where harmony returned to Selhurst Park.\n\n'I'm always honest,' the Austrian added when pressed on his recent words. 'I can’t do it differently.\n\n'If I feel something I say it and then I have to take the s***storm that follows. Hopefully everybody knows what I'm saying is for the success of Crystal Palace. Tonight the support was great.'\n\nPalace had won just two of their last 16 matches in all competitions heading into this clash - including a dire performance in last week's 1-1 draw in Bosnia - yet the energy and intensity that had been lacking during that run was back in the first half.\n\nMuch of their European campaign has been hampered by a failure to break down low blocks, but here they zipped the ball around and pressed with intent.\n\nIt was also notable how much more direct they were in their play and Jorgen Strand Larsen, Daichi Kamada and Guessand all went close early on.\n\nZrinjski were dogged, and Stimac’s side used all the tricks they could to slow Palace down and frustrate them.\n\nCrystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar (3-1 aggregate) Crystal Palace (3-4-2-1): Henderson (C) 7; Richards 7.5, Lacroix 8, Canvot 7.5; Munoz 7, Wharton 7.5 (Hughes 56 7), Kamada 7.5, Mitchell 7; Sarr 7, Guessand 8; Strand Larsen 7 (Johnson 73 6) Subs not used: Benitez (GK), Matthews (GK), Clyne, Sosa, Devenny, Rodney, Riad, Pino, Cardines Manager: Oliver Glasner 7 Yellow cards: Canvot, Strand Larsen, Wharton Goals: Lacroix 36, Guessand 90+3 Referee: Luis Godinho 5 \n\nYet it was Adam Wharton, one of many players to have struggled during the recent run, who whipped in a delightful free kick for Lacroix, the unsung hero of this side, to head home powerfully.\n\nThe atmosphere ramped up a notch and the question was whether the Eagles could capitalise, but Glasner’s side squandered a host of opportunities and the tension ramped up.\n\nIt almost cost them when Tomi Juric agonisingly headed wide for Zrinjski in injury time, although that left the stage for Guessand to settle things after good link-up play with Brennan Johnson as Palace secured their passage to the last-16.\n\n'Crystal Palace deserved to go through,' Stimac said. 'They played better football in both games.'"

Max Verstappen, whose run of four world titles was ended by 26-year-old Lando Norris, is 28 years of age.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNone of the elite pack - Norris, Verstappen, Oscar Piastri (24), George Russell, Leclerc - are turning 30 any time soon.\n\nView 4 Images Max Verstappen has hinted that he will retire from Formula One sooner rather than later (Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBut Verstappen is already talking about retirement. “I definitely see myself nearing the end,” the Red Bull driver said recently.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I don’t want to spend 25 years driving a car. I want to appreciate what’s out there.”\n\nHamilton has always seemed to be the sort that could spend 25 years driving a car - this will be his 20th year in Formula One - but still ‘appreciate what’s out there’. His interests beyond the car are clearly considerable.\n\nView 4 Images Lando Norris won his first drivers' world championship last season (Image: FIA/DPPI via Getty Images)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nBut he will not want to be seen as a ceremonial driver, as a driver who has been hired by Ferrari as much for his commercial pull as for his brilliance behind the wheel. Don’t forget, he is arguably the Greatest Of All Time.\n\nBut Hamilton’s last victory was in July, 2024. His last podium finish was in the same year, at the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Hamilton has earned the right to stay in a Formula One car for as long as he wants. And if he is still enjoying it - as he insists he is - why not carry on?\n\nBut Melbourne and Shanghai will tell us all we need to know about whether the GOAT has still got it. For the sport’s sake, let’s hope he has."

(0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

            "content": "FIFA has introduced a new system for the 2026 World Cup knockout stages that will see the top four seeded teams avoid each other until at least the semi-finals of next summer's 48-team tournament.\n\nIn a tennis-style, similar to the one adopted by FIFA during last summer's Club World Cup, the top two teams in the current FIFA rankings - Spain (1) and Argentina (2) - will be on opposite draw pathways, as will the third and fourth-ranked sides, France and England, to ensure competitive balance.\n\nAs a result, the four nations will be placed in different quadrants of the knockout phase and will be separated into pots. Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

You can't even dream about something like that.\"\n\nWhen Troy Parrott arrived for international duty with the Republic of Ireland last Monday, little did he know that six days later, he would have catapulted his country to the World Cup play-offs.\n\nFirst, there was an impressive 2-0 win against Portugal.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Ghana’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, has secured rare access to two Ghanaian citizens being held as prisoners of war in Ukraine, describing the visit as a major diplomatic breakthrough in ongoing efforts to secure their release.\n\nThe minister disclosed on Thursday that he was granted access to a highly fortified security camp where the two Ghanaians are being detained. He thanked Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Andrii Sybiha, for approving what he described as an unusual request — reportedly the first of its kind by an African foreign minister.\n\n“I can confirm that our citizens are alive and well. Their rights under international law have been commendably respected by Ukrainian authorities,” Mr Ablakwa stated.\n\nHe noted that the rare access granted by Ukrainian authorities reflects the cordial bilateral relations between Ghana and Ukraine and strengthens confidence in ongoing negotiations aimed at securing the men’s freedom.\n\n“This significant gesture gives me more confidence that our negotiations for their release will be successful,” he said.\n\nThe identities of the two prisoners have been withheld for security reasons. However, the minister revealed that both men expressed a firm resolve to turn their ordeal into advocacy.\n\n“It is refreshing to hear our two compatriots say that they are determined to become advocates against the modus operandi of trafficking networks and willing to devote the rest of their lives educating vulnerable Africans how to avoid such predicaments,” he added.\n\nMr Ablakwa’s visit to Kyiv forms part of high-level diplomatic engagements between Ghana and Ukraine, during which he also held talks with President Zelenskyy. The discussions are understood to have centred on bilateral cooperation and humanitarian considerations regarding the detained Ghanaians.\n\nThe development marks a significant step in Ghana’s diplomatic push to secure the safe return of its citizens while reinforcing its commitment to protecting nationals caught up in foreign conflicts.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The spotlight falls on the Arsenal and Chelsea rivalry once again on Sunday 1 March 2026, as the London heavyweights collide at the Emirates Stadium in a match that could have major implications at the upper end of the Premier League table.\n\nArsenal begin the weekend perched at the summit, but the mood around N5 is a little edgier than it was a fortnight ago. A frustrating 2-2 draw against bottom-of-the-log Wolves last week — in which they surrendered a two-goal lead — has invited renewed pressure from title rivals Manchester City. Having finished as runners-up in each of the past two seasons, the Gunners are desperate to avoid an unwanted hat-trick of near-misses.\n\nTheir home form remains a cornerstone of their challenge, and they will view this derby as an opportunity to reassert authority. Yet recent stumbles have highlighted vulnerabilities, particularly in defensive transitions, and Chelsea possess the pace and confidence to exploit any hesitation.\n\nThe visitors arrive with growing belief under new head coach Liam Rosenior. Appointed midway through the campaign, Rosenior is unbeaten in his first six Premier League matches in charge — a run that has reignited their push for a top-four, or potentially top-five, finish and a coveted Champions League berth.\n\nChelsea’s structure looks sharper, their pressing more coordinated, and there is renewed resilience in tight moments.\n\nThis will be the fourth meeting between the sides this season. Their league encounter at Stamford Bridge ended 1-1 in November, while Arsenal edged both legs of the League Cup semi-final — winning 3-2 away before sealing the tie with a 1-0 victory at home earlier this month. Familiarity breeds intensity, and there will be little margin for surprise.\n\nHistorically, Arsenal hold the edge in this fixture. Across 214 meetings in all competitions, they have 87 wins to Chelsea’s 66, with 61 draws. That statistical advantage, however, will count for little once the whistle blows.\n\nWith Arsenal fighting to protect top spot and Chelsea chasing Europe’s elite competition, the stakes are considerable. Expect a high-tempo, tactically charged derby — one that may significantly shape the trajectory of the title race and the battle for Champions League qualification alike.\n\nHead-to-Head\n\nPlayed: 214\n\nArsenal wins: 87\n\nChelsea wins: 66\n\nDraws: 61\n\nMeetings this season:\n\n\n\n- Premier League: Chelsea 1-1 Arsenal, 30 November 2025\n\n- League Cup, semifinal, first leg: Chelsea 2-3 Arsenal, 14 January 2026\n\n- League Cup, semifinal, second leg: Arsenal 1-0 Chelsea, 3 February 2026\n\nKey battle\n\nDeclan Rice v Cole Palmer\n\nRice Premier League season stats\n\nAppearances: 26\n\nGoals: 4\n\nAssists: 6\n\nYellow/red cards: 2/0\n\nPalmer Premier League season stats\n\nAppearances: 16\n\nGoals: 8\n\nAssists: 1\n\nYellow/red cards: 3/0\n\nThe midfield duel between Declan Rice and Cole Palmer could define the rhythm of the London clash between Arsenal and Chelsea. Rice will anchor Arsenal’s engine room, tasked with breaking up play, winning second balls and setting the tempo as the Gunners push to assert control.\n\nOpposite him, Palmer offers Chelsea their spark between the lines, drifting into pockets to create, carry and threaten with clever movement and sharp decision-making. If Rice can stifle Palmer’s influence, Arsenal gain control. If Palmer finds space, Chelsea gain belief. It’s a battle of authority versus invention at the heart of the contest.\n\nTactical outlook\n\nMikel Arteta v Liam Rosenior\n\nArteta Premier League stats\n\nMatches: 236\n\nWins: 140\n\nDraws: 48\n\nLosses: 48\n\nPoints: 468\n\nRosenior Premier League stats\n\nMatches: 6\n\nWins: 4\n\nDraws: 2\n\nLosses: 0\n\nPoints: 14\n\nThe tactical duel between Mikel Arteta and Liam Rosenior promises to be pivotal at the Emirates. Arteta’s Arsenal will look to dominate possession, control the midfield, and press high to force Chelsea into errors, relying on structured build-up and quick transitions.\n\nRosenior, meanwhile, will aim to disrupt Arsenal’s rhythm, exploiting space in transition and encouraging his players to attack in wide channels. Set-pieces, pressing triggers, and defensive compactness will be key.\n\nUltimately, it’s a clash of styles: Arteta’s structured, possession-based approach against Rosenior’s adaptive, counter-attacking strategy, with each coach seeking to outthink the other from the touchline.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ghana loses more than GHS 6.2 billion each year to diseases linked to poor waste management and sanitation, a new study by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at the University of Ghana has revealed.\n\nThe findings were presented at a high-level stakeholder engagement in Accra on Thursday, 26 February 2026. The forum brought together policymakers, Members of Parliament, local government officials, development partners, and private-sector actors to examine the economic case for increased investment in sanitation.\n\nThe research, led by Prof. Peter Quartey and Dr Kwame Adjei-Mantey, is titled An Economic Analysis of the Benefits of Adequate Investment in Waste Management and Sanitation in Ghana. It assessed both the economic and social consequences of current sanitation practices and modelled the potential gains from improved financing.\n\nAccording to the study, five diseases closely associated with poor sanitation — malaria, cholera, pneumonia, typhoid fever and diarrhoea — account for nearly 31.9 million lost workdays annually and an estimated 177,222 deaths.\n\nDirect medical costs were estimated at approximately GHS 5.8 billion annually, with an additional GHS 650 million in lost productivity. This brings the total annual economic burden to over GHS 6.2 billion.\n\nDespite these losses, Ghana currently spends an average of about GHS 38 per tonne of waste generated. The researchers described this as modest compared to the scale of the health and economic damage associated with poor sanitation systems.\n\nUsing cost–benefit modelling, the team found that under the current business-as-usual approach, every GHS 1 invested in waste management generates about GHS 180 in economic returns. Under a best-case scenario — where investment rises to approximately GHS 1,028 per tonne in line with lower-middle-income benchmarks — returns could increase to GHS 556 per GHS 1 invested.\n\nIn absolute terms, projected national benefits under the enhanced investment scenario could reach about GHS 58 billion in 2025 and rise to GHS 67.2 billion by 2032. These gains are largely driven by sharp reductions in disease incidence, mortality and productivity losses.\n\nPresenting the findings, Prof. Quartey urged the government to stop treating sanitation as a residual expenditure. He stressed that waste management must be viewed as a high-return development investment capable of protecting public health and strengthening economic growth.\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session, participants raised concerns about how much of the disease burden could be directly attributed to waste. The research team explained that their modelling relied on global health data and assumed that about 45 per cent of the selected disease cases were attributable to waste exposure. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test different attribution levels.\n\nStakeholders also questioned whether the best-case scenario reflected realities in slum and rural communities, where waste collection remains inconsistent. Prof. Quartey acknowledged that waste management in such areas is more complex and costly due to access challenges, noting that flexible and smaller-scale collection systems may be required rather than a uniform national model.\n\nOther concerns centred on uncollected waste and dumping in drains and water bodies. The researchers said their modelling incorporated standardised ranges for lower-middle-income countries, taking into account infrastructure gaps and collection inefficiencies.\n\nMembers of Parliament at the forum emphasised the need for stronger inter-agency coordination. While some proposed the establishment of a National Sanitation Authority, others cautioned against expanding bureaucracy and instead suggested strengthening existing institutional structures.\n\nEducation and job creation also featured prominently in the discussions. Prof. Quartey referenced earlier regional research on green jobs and recycling, stressing that investment in skills development and public awareness could unlock employment opportunities in the waste sector.\n\nThe research team concluded that Ghana’s annual sanitation-related losses far exceed current spending levels. They called for increased and sustained investment, targeted interventions in high-risk communities, and stronger data and budgeting systems within Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies to ensure sanitation is prioritised as a central pillar of national development.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Parliament’s approval of the Ghana Accelerated National Reserve Accumulation Policy (GANRAP 2026–2028) has sparked renewed debate over transparency and policy continuity.\n\nKojo Oppong Nkrumah, Minority Spokesperson on the Economy and Development Committee, took centre stage to urge the government to be more candid.\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the House, he framed the discussion around the long-standing Domestic Gold Purchase Program, first introduced under former Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia.\n\n“The program was designed to boost the foreign reserves by buying local gold and either adding it to bullion or converting it into forex,” he said, noting that GANRAP essentially continues the same framework under a new name.\n\n“Ghanaians deserve honesty,” he stressed. “If this government finds the program useful, there is no need to rebrand it as something new. Admit that you inherited a working policy and build on it. Candour is central to credible economic management.”\n\nGANRAP's key feature is its ambitious goal of adding US$9.5 billion annually to Ghana’s reserves through weekly purchases of approximately 3.02 tonnes of gold.\n\nUnder the policy, the Ghana Gold Board (GOLDBOD) will procure gold from small-scale miners, while a pre-emptive right will allow the state to acquire 20% of output from large-scale mining companies.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance says the policy is expected to strengthen Ghana’s foreign reserves and provide 15 months of import cover by the end of 2028.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential benefits, Mr Oppong Nkrumah raised concerns about recent inconsistencies in the government’s handling of gold reserves.\n\n“A few weeks ago, they sold 50% of our gold reserves and converted them into U.S. dollar-based assets. Now they are asking Parliament to approve the purchase of more gold to replenish reserves. Why sell at $4,000 per ounce, only to consider repurchasing weeks later at over $5,200?” he questioned.\n\nThe MP argued that the current government should embrace continuity rather than reinvention.\n\n“The Ghanaian voter is informed and understands economic policies. You don’t need to rebrand, rename, or polish inherited programs. What matters is building on them responsibly.”\n\nMr Oppong Nkrumah also commended the aspects of GANRAP that align with Dr Bawumia’s earlier G-4-R principles, which emphasised domestic resource mobilisation, results-based management, and the use of gold as a stabilising anchor for the Ghanaian currency.\n\nHowever, he warned that without transparency, the program risks public scepticism and could undermine confidence in national reserve management.\n\nParliamentarians largely supported the policy’s operationalisation, highlighting its potential to strengthen gross international reserves without further borrowing.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

She emphasised that she would always voice out her concerns.\n\n\n\nHer comments follow her controversial picketing against the government in 2023, under the leadership of former President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, over the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).\n\n\n\nSpeaking in an interview on Joy News on February 26, 2026, Akuffo said she would gladly participate in any form of protest if it was against unlawful actions that affected citizens.\n\n\n\n“You don’t sit there and just let unlawful things be done and if you feel strongly about it and there’s no one to listen to you, you shout it out,” she said.\n\n\n\nThe former head of the judiciary was seen holding a placard in 2023 that read, “We use our bond yields to pay our rent, medical bills, electricity bills and water bills.”\n\nShe had joined retirees demanding a total exemption from the controversial DDEP for their investments.\n\n\n\nFormer Chief Justice details how she joined protest against Akufo-Addo’s govt\n\n\n\nAkuffo explained that she was not part of the decision-making process that imposed “haircuts” on bondholders.\n\n\n\n“First and foremost, I wasn’t there in that boardroom when that decision was made to give people haircuts, whether they liked it or not.

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Ottawa say India is no longer a ‘security threat’ after allegations of transnational violence rocked bilateral ties, even as Canadian Sikh activists live under threat. Can Carney’s India visit reset relations?\n\nAs officials in Ottawa were preparing for Prime Minister Mark Carney’s maiden visit to India, Canadian police were knocking on a Sikh activist’s door in Surrey, Vancouver, on Sunday to inform him that his life was at risk.\n\nMoninder Singh, who heads the Sikh Federation of Canada, had previously already received three such warnings from the Vancouver police. But this time, citing a confidential informant, police told Singh that his wife and two children were at risk, too.\n\n“I was told to make sure it’s extended to you, your wife and your two children,” the police officer told Singh in a conversation recorded on his home’s doorbell camera.\n\nSingh was an associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist and Canadian citizen who was assassinated in Canada in June 2023. The killing caused a massive diplomatic row. Canada accused Indian government agents of involvement in Nijjar’s killing, and framed it as part of an Indian policy of transnational repression targeting Sikh activists abroad.\n\nBut, while Singh was informed of the threat to him and his family on Sunday, a senior Canadian government official told reporters in an off-the-record briefing on Wednesday that “India is no longer a threat” to security, two days before Carney was due to land in New Delhi.\n\nThis marks a significant shift in Canada’s tone and approach to India under Carney, who is looking to diversify foreign relations to cushion the impact from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war, analysts say.\n\nObservers say Carney’s visit to New Delhi this week could mark the start of a reset of the bilateral relationship, which hit new lows in recent years under Canada’s former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe rupture in ties\n\nThe mood in Ottawa had already changed a great deal since Carney succeeded Trudeau to lead the government in March last year.\n\n\n\nUnder Trudeau, relations between Canada and India had deteriorated to tit-for-tat accusations and the expulsion of diplomats, particularly since the killing of Nijjar in June 2023.\n\nNijjar was a prominent advocate for a Sikh homeland in the form of an independent Khalistani state in India. New Delhi calls this separatism and views Nijjar and others in the movement as “terrorists”.\n\nFollowing Nijjar’s killing, pressure mounted on Trudeau from the influential Sikh diaspora in Canada, demanding accountability. In October 2024, during an inquiry into foreign interference, Trudeau said there were “ever clearer indications” that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty by targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil.\n\nIndia’s “actions”, Trudeau said, were a “horrific mistake”.\n\nCanada also accused India of interfering in its domestic politics, including by providing funds to politicians whom New Delhi preferred. India firmly rejected the allegations, calling them “preposterous”, and urged Canada to take action against anti-Indian elements operating from its soil – an apparent reference to Sikh activists.\n\nBut Nijjar’s killing opened a can of worms for the Indian establishment. In November 2023, the US Department of Justice charged an Indian national with allegedly plotting to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American lawyer and also a Sikh activist.\n\nNikhil Gupta, 54, accused of plotting to kill Pannun, pleaded guilty to three criminal charges in a federal court in New York City earlier this month. He faces up to 40 years in prison for admitting to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nSikh activists in the United Kingdom were also reportedly warned of a threat from the Indian government.\n\nTrudeau’s approach to the issue, in some sense, had become emblematic of the problem in bilateral ties, said Harsh Pant, a foreign policy analyst in New Delhi.\n\nHis confrontational approach “meant that issues that could have been dealt with at the bureaucratic level were elevated to the strategic level”, and it became difficult to disentangle the two, he added.\n\nThaw in icy relations\n\nWhen Carney was elected new leader of the ruling Liberal Party in 2025, he replaced Justin Trudeau amid historic tensions with the United States and fears of a trade war with the Trump administration. Carney took the stage, actively looking for new partners to mitigate this threat.\n\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi leapt to congratulate him and immediately called on him “to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people”.\n\nSoon, Carney had invited Modi to Canada for the G7 summit in June last year, where both leaders met on the sidelines. New envoys in both countries followed. Suddenly, everything had changed in the relationship, said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based analyst on South Asia.\n\n“There is just more optimism and momentum for the relationship,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. Under Carney, the Canadian government “recognises that this relationship is too important to let it flounder”.\n\nThe commercial incentives for Canada to get the relationship back on track are huge. “And that all starts with changing the tone and the mood,” Kugelman said. Hence, this week’s comments by Canadian officials that “India is no longer a threat”.\n\nVina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera that Ottawa has moved from a public, crisis-driven posture to a more deliberate, step-by-step “reset”.\n\nUnder Carney, “the emphasis is on rebuilding structured channels so security concerns – including transnational repression and interference – can be handled through sustained law enforcement and national security cooperation rather than megaphone diplomacy,” she argued.\n\n“Ottawa is trying to do both at once: defend the rule of law at home while advancing areas of mutual interest abroad.”\n\nBut Carney’s change in approach does not mean the problem of threats against Sikh activists has vanished.\n\n“Canadian officials definitely still worry about the transnational repression issue, and particularly as legal proceedings continue,” said Kugelman.\n\nThe current Canadian government is merely taking a different approach, he suggested: “a more ‘accommodationist’ approach – one that focuses on essentially working through this issue with India”.\n\nUnlike the Canadian officials in their off-the-record briefing, Foreign Minister Anita Anand evaded a direct question from reporters when quizzed about whether India is no longer considered a threat. Instead, she said, discussions on the issues of transnational violence are ongoing at the highest levels of both governments.\n\nNew Delhi will also want to address the challenges of “Khalistani extremism”, which will be a challenge for Carney, said Pant, who is vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank.\n\nThe way forward\n\nOn Friday, Carney began his two-day visit to New Delhi, where the two prime ministers are holding talks at Hyderabad House and will review the India-Canada Strategic Partnership.\n\nThe Canadian PM is also expected to lock in deals on trade and investment, including on energy, critical minerals, agriculture, education, research and people-to-people ties.\n\n\n\nCollaboration in these sectors will define the trajectory of this relationship going forward, said Pant.\n\nUltimately, the key external factor driving Carney’s visit to New Delhi is Trump’s trade war, said Kugelman. Both Canada and India have seen their relations with the US, a top trade partner, slide since Trump returned to the White House in January last year.\n\nWhile India has somewhat stabilised its relations with the US this year since trade negotiations reached the final stages, Ottawa and Washington remain at odds over their worldviews and international trade.\n\n“[Carney’s approach] is part of a broader global trend that we’re seeing, countries that have worked with the US for a long time are now looking to strengthen ties with other partners,” said Kugelman. “From the perspective of Ottawa and New Delhi, it’s really a no-brainer that this relationship not only has to get back on track, but it also needs to be put in a position where it can grow even more.”\n\nNadjibulla of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada added that India is key to Canada’s efforts to reduce over-reliance on the US and to diversify its economic and strategic partnerships.\n\nBut unresolved issues, like the ones of transnational violence, undermine the durability of now-blooming bilateral ties, she added.\n\n“If unresolved security allegations sit in the background without credible processes and enforcement cooperation, normalisation becomes politically brittle,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. “Vulnerable to the next incident, leak, or court development.”"

            "content": "Hamas says latest attacks show Israel’s ‘blatant disregard for the efforts of mediators, and its complete disregard for the Peace Council and its role’.\n\nAt least six Palestinians have been killed in Israeli drone attacks targeting two police posts in the Bureij refugee camp in the central Gaza Strip and the al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis in the south, as Israel presses on with its more than two-year genocidal war on the devastated enclave.\n\nThe attacks overnight into Friday were condemned by Hamas as undermining mediator efforts during a “ceasefire” phase that Israel has violated almost daily since October 10.\n\nMedical sources at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis reported the arrival of four bodies and several wounded individuals following an Israeli military strike on a police checkpoint at the al-Maslakh intersection in al-Mawasi. The sources said that the strike occurred in an area outside the Israeli military’s control, and described the condition of some of the wounded as critical.\n\nIn the central Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were killed and others were injured in a similar Israeli drone strike that targeted a police post at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp.\n\nHamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said that the rising number of deaths as a result of the ongoing Israeli bombardment across the Gaza Strip reflects “the Zionist occupation’s blatant disregard for the efforts of mediators, and its complete disregard for the Peace Council and its role”.\n\nQassem added, in a statement, that Israel is continuing its war of extermination against the Palestinian people, despite some changes to form and method, indicating that “the talk of the guarantor states about stopping the war lacks any real substance on the ground”.\n\n\n\nReporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said, “t has been a bloody night. Israeli forces carried out a series of deadly air strikes, this time primarily focusing on police checkpoints that have been deployed too close to areas where armed militias are operating in the eastern communities of the Gaza Strip, in particular in … Khan Younis and al Bureij refugee camp.”\n\n“Six police members have been killed as a result … But also here the timing and location are critically reshaping the whole equation between both sides\n\nIsrael has made clear that Israel will not be responsible for reorganising the remnants of life in Gaza. That’s why we can see that any kind of restoration of previous services, including police… will be thwarted,” he added.\n\nAid organisations expulsion deadline\n\nIn the meantime, Israel has ordered 37 aid groups to halt operations in the occupied territories, a move described as having potentially devastating consequences for Palestinians, unless they hand over personal details about Palestinian staff by this Sunday March 1.\n\nThe organisations warn that complying could put employees at risk, compromise humanitarian neutrality, and violate European data protection rules.\n\nSeventeen international NGOs, including Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE International, have challenged the order in Israel’s Supreme Court, saying they could be forced to stop operations.\n\nAbu Azzoum said, “This could mark a major turning point for the humanitarian response system in Gaza.” Aid groups may be forced to suspend operations entirely if the order stands, he added.\n\nOxfam International said on Tuesday that the forced closure of aid operations in Gaza and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory could begin as early as Saturday.\n\n“The effect would be immediate, extending well beyond individual organisations to the wider humanitarian system,” Oxfam warned.\n\n“In Gaza, families remain dependent on external assistance amid continuing restrictions on aid entry and renewed strikes in densely populated areas,” it said in a statement.\n\n“In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, military incursions, demolitions, displacement, settlement expansion and settler violence are driving rising humanitarian needs,” it added.\n\nPressure from Israel on international humanitarian groups has been growing for years and escalated sharply after October 7, 2023."

            "content": "President Prabowo Subianto is trying to expand Indonesia’s global standing, but questions raised about role of military in Gaza peace plan.\n\nIndonesia is preparing to send 1,000 soldiers to Gaza within weeks, the first contingent of some 8,000 personnel that Jakarta has pledged to deploy to the Palestinian territory as part of an International Stabilization Force (ISF) under United States President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.\n\nIndonesian army spokesperson Brigadier General Donny Pramono told news media the first troops are preparing to reach the enclave by April, and the majority will be on the ground in Gaza by June.\n\nBut as the hasty deployment approaches, some Indonesians are questioning what role their armed forces will play in the mission amid Israel’s genocidal war on the Palestinian territory.\n\nIndonesia is a seasoned participant in United Nations-led peacekeeping missions, but critics fear that without oversight by the UN, Indonesian forces could be used as “pawns” by the US – Israel’s foremost ally – to control Palestinians in Gaza and formalise the occupation of the enclave.\n\n“We are afraid that Indonesia will be used as the buffer to control the Palestinians,” Shofwan Al Banna Choiruzzad, an associate professor at the University of Indonesia, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Indonesia has built a reputation in Palestine as one of the most active partners on the ground. It would be very painful for both Palestinians and Indonesians if they see the Indonesian army becoming an instrument of the occupation,” Shofwan said.\n\n“The worry is that Indonesia will only be a shock absorber,” he said.\n\n“Indonesia will only be an actor which is used to establish legitimacy [for Israel’s occupation], and worse.”\n\n\n\nComplicating matters further is the fact that Indonesia does not have diplomatic relations with Israel owing to its long support for the Palestinian cause.\n\n“Indonesia needs to make clear that it will not be in the sectors which risk confrontation with Palestinian factions, [and] it will also not be in the Israeli-controlled areas – because that will require operational coordination with the Israeli army, which means practical recognition of Israel,” Shofwan said.\n\n‘Palestinians are seen as objects’\n\nIndonesia – with the world’s largest Muslim population – was the first among members of the Board of Peace to commit a specific number of soldiers to the ISF.\n\nJakarta’s pledge of peacekeepers was then followed by Kosovo, Morocco, Albania, and Kazakhstan, although they have not said their troops’ strength in the enclave.\n\nOfficials in Jakarta have stressed the country will play a “balancing” role on the Board of Peace alongside other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan.\n\nBut, as a longstanding supporter of a two-state solution and an independent Palestine, observers worry that Indonesia’s stance will be compromised by its involvement in the Gaza operation.\n\nIndonesian President Prabowo Subianto could also soon face difficult questions about the work of the Board of Peace and its plans for the reconstruction of Gaza and the future of the territory’s Palestinian population, analysts say.\n\nUniversity of Indonesia’s Shofwan said the Board of Peace and its approach to Gaza is fundamentally “colonial”.\n\n“It is designed to achieve negative peace without putting the rights and voices of Palestinians at the centre, and Palestinians are seen as objects,” he said.\n\n“They are seen to be something that needs to be controlled. There are no restraints towards Israel at all, so the design is very colonial,” Shofwan added.\n\nThe board’s executive committee comprises Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner; US Secretary of State Marco Rubio; Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to the Middle East; Marc Rowen, CEO of Apollo Global Management; World Bank President Ajay Banga; former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair; and Robert Gabriel Jr, US deputy national security adviser.\n\nPalestinian participation in the board has been siloed into a “transitional committee” of apolitical technocrats led by Ali Shaath, a former Palestinian Authority (PA) deputy minister.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, shortly after Prabowo signed on to the Board of Peace, representatives from some 40 civil society and religious groups in Indonesia met the president to discuss the Gaza mission, Indonesia’s state news agency Antara reported at the time.\n\nPrabowo told the groups he was prepared to withdraw from the Board of Peace if it “fails to advance the goal of an independent Palestine”, Antara reported, citing Muhammad Cholil Nafis, vice chairman of Indonesia’s top Islamic advisory body.\n\nIndonesia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also emphasised that the country’s troops will be in Gaza “solely to support Palestine’s recovery and its fight for independence and sovereignty”.\n\nIn addition to deploying troops to Gaza, Indonesia will also focus on humanitarian assistance and send several hospital ships.\n\nBut observers told Al Jazeera that Prabowo’s decision to join the Board of Peace reflected more his “personalised” style of leadership and his desire to be seen as a global player than a direct concern with the question of Palestine.\n\n“We participated with peacekeepers in Lebanon and [the Democratic Republic of the] Congo, but now the new president wants to make Indonesia diplomatically stronger on the global level,” said Yon Machmudi, an expert in Indonesian politics and international relations, also at the University of Indonesia.\n\n“This is also part of the motivation of the president to be involved in any kind of negotiations with the peace process,” he said.\n\n“I think Prabowo truly wants to leave a significant legacy, remembered as a president active in global peace, not only in the Middle East but also in other regions, such as the Russia-Ukraine war,” Machmudi said.\n\n‘It’s about maintaining optics’\n\nPrabowo, a former military general once banned from entering the US, has found himself in the global spotlight since being elected president in 2024, starting with his decision to visit China on his first international trip.\n\nHe has since visited Russia twice, skipping a Group of Seven meeting in June to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nMuhammad Zulfikar Rakhmat, director of the Indonesia-MENA desk at the Centre for Economic and Law Studies in Jakarta, told Al Jazeera that he believes Prabowo has been trying to get Trump’s attention.\n\nThe US president has a track record of responding to assertive and transactional leadership, and once said he gets along better with world leaders “the tougher and meaner they are”.\n\nCourting China and Russia was one step towards Prabowo getting US attention, while signing on to the Board of Peace and deploying Indonesian troops to Gaza was another, Rakhmat said.\n\nIn the mix of motivations for joining the board, Prabowo may also have been hoping for a better trade deal with the US after Trump unleashed trade tariffs last year. The White House initially planned to levy a “reciprocal” tariff of 32 percent on Indonesian exports, which was later cut down to 19 percent.\n\n\n\nThe Indonesian president late last week signed a formal trade deal with Trump on the sidelines of the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, DC. The deal kept tariff rates at 19 percent, while Indonesia agreed to cut tariffs on 99 percent of its US imports. It is still unclear how the deal will be impacted by a landmark ruling on Friday from the US Supreme Court striking down the legal basis for many of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nRakhmat fears Prabowo’s ambition makes it less likely that he will push back if something goes wrong in the Gaza operation and Palestinians are negatively impacted.\n\nHe told Al Jazeera that Prabowo will likely “condemn” any operational drift in the Gaza plan, rather than withdraw completely from the Board of Peace.\n\n“People will expect more, but looking at his past behaviours, it is unlikely he will do something extraordinary,” Rakhmat said.\n\nThe Indonesian president “wants to have a good image among major powers. It’s about maintaining optics”, he said."

            "content": "Carney’s trip comes at a time when he’s looking for new markets for Canadian exports to diversify from the US.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is heading to India for what experts say is a “very significant trip” as he tries to reset relations between the two countries and find new markets for Canadian exports.\n\nWhile the trip, which starts Friday, is expected to be heavy on diplomacy, experts question whether it will result in major economic deals to shore up Canada’s economy.\n\nCarney has pledged to broaden the country’s trading partners as relations with its neighbour, the United States, fray. And India, with its 1.4 billion people, is a potentially large market for Canada’s vast petroleum and natural gas reserves, among other products.\n\nBut to build those economic bonds will require Carney to overcome diplomatic tensions and hesitancy about the costs of its exports, according to analysts.\n\n“Canada domestically needs to figure out to what extent it wants to grow its oil and gas industry,” said Tarun Khanna, professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on energy policy.\n\n“Improvement in the overall relationship can provide incentives to both nations.”\n\nRepairing a diplomatic rupture\n\nPart of the hurdle for Carney is repairing recent diplomatic strains between his country and India.\n\nThe two countries engaged in a prolonged diplomatic freeze in September 2023, after Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alleged that India was involved in the killing of a Sikh separatist activist on Canadian soil.\n\nIndia rejected the allegations as false, and both countries expelled each other’s diplomats.\n\n\n\nA breakthrough came last year when Carney invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Kananaskis, Alberta, to attend the Group of Seven (G7) leaders’ summit in June.\n\nSince then, relations have thawed. In September, both sides named new diplomats to serve as high commissioners to each other’s countries.\n\nIn the lead-up to this week’s meeting, more bilateral collaboration has unfolded. Officials from India and Canada have engaged in senior ministerial and working-level engagements in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), liquefied natural gas (LNG), critical minerals and supply chain resilience.\n\n“This is a very significant visit and allows Prime Minister Carney to consolidate a reset that began in the relationship last year,” said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, a research institute.\n\nFinding alternative trading partners\n\nBut the rapprochement with India also comes in a transition period for Canada.\n\nThe US has long been its primary trading partner: It is the only country it shares a border with. But since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, the US has taken an aggressive stance towards trade with Canada.\n\nTrump has stacked steep tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminium and automobile parts. He also suggested he would like Canada to cede its sovereignty and become a state within the US.\n\nCarney has resisted such efforts, including by imposing counter-tariffs on US goods.\n\nBut in January, he gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he outlined his vision for “middle-power” states to break from the superpowers that seek their “subordination”.\n\n“From the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just,” Carney said.\n\n“This is the task of the middle powers: the countries that have the most to lose from a world of fortresses and the most to gain from genuine cooperation.”\n\nCarney’s trip to India, followed by Australia and Japan, is his first major trip to Asia following his Davos speech. Experts say the outing will give him a stage on which to spread his appeal for “genuine cooperation” among smaller economies.\n\n“It allows him to take that message of middle-power diplomacy to India, Australia and Japan, the three most significant for Canada in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Nadjibulla.\n\nThe trip also comes at a time when, on the domestic front, Carney’s top priority is to strengthen economic resilience, make sure investments keep flowing into Canada, and protect industries that have been hit by Trump’s tariffs.\n\n\n\nAs part of that push, Carney visited China last month, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so in almost a decade.\n\nA market for Canadian energy\n\nCarney’s latest trip is expected to yield announcements on Canadian exports of oil, natural gas, uranium and critical minerals, as well as cooperation with India on developing nuclear power as a clean energy source.\n\nThe outreach effort is “part of Carney’s strategy” to diversify its economic trading partners and find new markets for its products, according to MV Ramana, an expert in energy and security at the University of British Columbia.\n\nCanada is the fourth-largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and the fifth-largest oil producer overall. Its crude exports were valued at more than $100.7bn in 2024 alone.\n\nBut Ramana believes that negotiations will also centre on Canada’s uranium. The North American country is the world’s second-largest producer of the metal, which is key to nuclear power production.\n\n“Canada is trying to position itself as an exporter, a petro-state of sorts — not just for oil and gas, but also critical minerals and uranium,” Ramana said.\n\nIndia has a long history of nuclear cooperation with Canada, which provided it with a research reactor in the 1950s for its nascent nuclear programme.\n\nIt has continued to import uranium from Canada, and the two countries are in the midst of finalising a 10-year, $2.8bn deal that would ensure a supply of the metal to India.\n\nGiven that backdrop, Ramana said he expects to see announcements on small modular reactors for nuclear energy, even though there are currently only a few operating in Russia and China.\n\nThe first in North America — the Darlington New Nuclear Project — is in the works in Ontario, and Carney appears to be angling for Canada to become a leader in such small-scale reactors. But it won’t be easy, warned Ramana.\n\n“These are supposed to be cheaper, but they also produce far less power. As a result, the cost per unit of power generation will be much higher,” he said.\n\nAnother complication is the fact that the licence for the modular reactor design is owned by a US company.\n\nThat means the US will need to be involved, said Ramana, a tricky balance as Carney continues to be in the crosshairs of Trump.\n\n‘Combination of price and strategic decision’\n\nWith the largest population in the world, India’s already-huge energy demands are expected to keep increasing.\n\nKhanna, the energy policy expert, said that means there is likely to be negotiation about fossil fuels as well during Carney’s trip.\n\n“We don’t know what will materialise, but given the Indian energy situation, oil and gas is one thing that will be on the table,” said Khanna.\n\nBut India has also faced backlash under Trump about where it sources its energy supply from.\n\nIn August, the US president slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on India, doubling his tariffs on the South Asian nation to 50 percent, as a penalty for its import of Russian oil.\n\nThat was finally rolled back this month, and US tariffs on India were brought down to 18 percent, though that rate, among others, was overturned by a decision from the US Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nNow, the current US tariffs on Indian imports sit at 10 percent. But experts have warned that Trump’s tariff policies have sown uncertainty among the US’s trading partners, including India.\n\nSo New Delhi is looking to secure its oil supplies, and Canada is looking for new buyers, Khanna said. But price will ultimately be the key.\n\n“India is a price-sensitive market, so the Indian side will be looking for deals that secure supplies but at a reasonable price,” he pointed out.\n\nIf Ottawa seeks to increase its market, “then it’s up to them to see what kind of incentives they can hand out”, Khanna added.\n\nFor India to sign a deal, “it will have to be a combination of price and strategic decision”."

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” – a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

The company will shrink from more than 10,000 people to less than 6,000, Dorsey says in a post on X. And the reason why? AI.\n\n“We’re not making this decision because we’re in trouble,” Dorsey says. “Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter, Dorsey says that “We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.”"

Even the controllers are convertible: the right side controller can be used as a vertical mouse in “FPS Mode,” similar to the mouse mode on the Legion Go 2 or the Nintendo Switch 2. The right-side controller also has a built-in display that shows performance metrics and settings and doubles as a touchpad.\n\nThe Legion Go Fold is rumored to include an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 48 Whr battery. According to WindowsLatest, Lenovo plans to announce it as a concept device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, although it likely wouldn’t be commercially available right away, if ever."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow?

That’s according to the latest report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), which forecasts smartphone shipments to plummet 12.9 percent this year, marking its “lowest annual shipment volume in more than a decade.”\n\nAt the same time, the average selling price for smartphones is set to hit new highs, with IDC predicting a 14 percent increase to a record $523. “While memory prices are projected to stabilize by mid-2027, they are unlikely to return to previous level,” IDC senior researcher Nabila Popal says, adding that the sub-$100 phone segment will become “permanently uneconomical.” Next week, Apple is rumored to announce a new edition of its budget smartphone as the “iPhone 17e,” which could give a hint about where things are going.\n\nThe memory shortage is expected to impact budget-friendly Android smartphones the most, as the rising costs of components leave them with “no choice but to pass the costs on to end users,” Francisco Jeronimo, the vice president for IDC’s Worldwide Client Devices, says in the report. That could result in smaller brands exiting the industry, while allowing Apple and Samsung to grab more market share, according to Popal."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks.

            "content": "Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said Thursday that he “cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon’s] request” to give the military unrestricted access to its AI systems.\n\n“Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” Amodei wrote in a statement. “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

There’s no need to be nasty about it.”"

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\n\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

But the Lowe’s hardware store empire is plenty big these days. A tool-filled Lowe’s superstore is now about as big as a New York City block. The focus stays mostly on appliances and tools for the home DIYer, more than large building contractors. I like to pop in for grill and griddle tools, or just some propane. But you can also buy a pre-finished door complete with the frame—or the lumber, sanders, routers, and saws you’d use to make your own door, including the hinges and the wood stain. It’s easy to get lost in the endless aisles if you love the smell of plaster and wood dust, but it’s easier to find the best Lowe’s deals on the website. This roundup includes Lowe’s daily deals, a promo code, and Lowe's offer code for 40% off appliances, plus info on the Lowe’s rewards program and military discounts.\n\nQuick Ways to Save at Lowe’s: Text Alerts and Daily Deals\n\nLowe’s wants to be able to tell you about its deals, hoping you’ll be tempted to take advantage of them. If you’re a consistent DIYer, it’s likely worth getting a heads-up on the Lowe’s Deals of the Day, delivered to your phone via text message. This might be anything from drills to snow blowers or lawn mowers, plus the best package deals on appliances, refrigerators, washers, and dryers. Each of these deals is one-day only. If you \n\nJoin the MyLowe’s Rewards Program, Get Maximum Benefits\n\nIf you’re planning on doing some major work this year, or just like to putter around, it’s probably worth picking up a MyLowe’s Rewards Program membership. Each eligible purchase accrues points that’ll pay out in increments of $5 in-store credit at Lowe’s. Like a lot of loyalty programs, you get more benefits if you spend more at the store, including free shipping on all purchases including the small ones, member-only discounts, and point boosters for better discounts.\n\nThere are three tiers of memberships, depending what you buy. One large appliance might already qualify you for the highest tier of rewards, at which point you might as well. These are the three tiers, based on the total cost of what you’ve bought at Lowe’s in the past year. Bronze ($0-$499): $35 minimum for free shipping; 1 point per $1 spent. Silver ($500-$1,999): Free shipping; 1.25 points per $1 spent. Gold ($2,000+): Free shipping; 1.5 points per $1 spent.\n\nFor contractors, there’s a separate MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Program that offers Lowe’s in-store credit in increments of $1 for every 100 points earned. (Points expire in half-yearly increments, on June 30 and December 31.) Benefits include member-only deals, volume discounts, free standard shipping in the contiguous United States, and a 20% paint discount after annual spend of $3,000 or more. Other benefits include analytics and spend reports, online order quoting, and purchase authorization for specified crew members.\n\n10% Military Discount, Plus Free MyLowe’s Silver Status\n\nAll verified active military, veterans, and military spouses are eligible for a 10% discount on full-price items—meaning things don’t have to be on sale to be on sale. This is available through what Lowe’s calls the Everyday Military Discount program. When you enroll, you also get an immediate upgrade to Silver status on the MyLowe’s Rewards program, which means more rewards points earned per dollar, and free shipping on all orders in the contiguous United States.\n\nGet a free Silver status upgrade instantly when you enroll in our Military Discount program and validate through ID.me. MyLowe’s Rewards Silver status members receive free standard shipping (excludes AK and HI) and earn more points per dollar.\n\nSave 5% on Everyday Purchases at Lowe’s\n\nLike a lot of big retailers, Lowe’s also has a store credit card with discounts attached. The MyLowe’s Rewards Credit Card offers 5% off qualified purchases, with a whole bunch of asterisks. Specifically, the discount applies after all other discounts and can’t be combined with other programs like contractor bulk discounts, employee discounts, or military discounts. It also doesn’t work on Weber, Miele, or Kichler products. Scroll to the bottom here, for APR and exceptions. The smart person signs up during a big purchase: When you sign up and get approved, you get 20% off an in-store purchase (up to $100 off).\n\nAnother way to get 5% off on items you need regularly is to set up a Lowe’s subscription. This is good for items ranging from cleaning products, air and water filters, lawn care, pet goods, plumbing, and batteries. Shipping is free, and delivery happens automatically."

            "content": "Iowa lawmakers voted to advance state House bill 751 last week, legislation that would ensure farmers in the state can freely repair their own agricultural equipment, like tractors. This Tuesday, the bill was renamed to House File 2709, and it will be voted on again. Should the political winds align, it will go through the Iowa House and Senate before the Iowa Legislature adjourns on April 21.\n\nThe bill is the first of nearly 57 state bills supported by repair advocates across the country in 2026. Many of them focus on farm equipment in states like Oklahoma, Wyoming, Delaware, and West Virginia. Repair advocates hope a win in Iowa—the second-highest-grossing state in the US for agricultural products, behind California—will help further legislative and broader efforts to make phones, cars, and other devices more repairable.\n\n“This isn't just a blue state thing; this isn't just a Colorado activist thing,” says Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability for the right-to-repair advocate arm of iFixit. “Its real. Farmers have trouble repairing their equipment and want change.”\n\nFarmers and their tractors have long been a focal point of the right-to-repair movement, the ever-growing global effort to let product owners fix their own devices and equipment without manufacturer approval. Farmers who use tractors to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops often need to repair their equipment while they work. Waiting for manufacturer approval to get something fixed, or taking the time to bring the equipment to an approved dealership, can cause delays, frustration, and missed opportunities to harvest crops.\n\nThe Iowa bill defines which agricultural equipment it covers, including tractors, trailers, combines, sprayers, balers, and other equipment used to cultivate and harvest crops. It excludes aircraft and irrigation equipment, along with jet skis and snowmobiles.\n\nManufacturers would also be required to provide owners with data—documentation, like manuals, and access to embedded operating software—on their tractors, including future patches and fixes, all without charging for it or requiring authorization for internet access. The bill also limits the use of digital locks—software restrictions that prevent accessing features without manufacturer approval.\n\nOh Deere\n\nThe most prominent opposition to the Iowa bill is tractor manufacturer John Deere, which has a long history of opposing repair efforts and frustrating farmers who want to take more control of their equipment. The company is still fighting a lawsuit the US Federal Trade Commission levied against John Deere in January 2025 for “unlawful” repairability policies. The company has lobbied against the Iowa bill and outright opposes its passing.\n\n“John Deere is steadfast in supporting farmers' ability to repair their equipment,” wrote a John Deere representative in a statement responding to WIRED’s inquiry. “And we back that up by offering industry-leading self-repair tools and resources to both equipment owners and alternative service providers.”"

Both Amazon and Best Buy have the hazel color marked down from $229 to $180, a $49 discount on Google's most upgraded wireless earbuds.\n\nThe first change you'll notice from the previous generation Pixel Buds Pro is that the newer model is much lighter, and the buds are 27 percent smaller. As a result, these are an excellent choice for anyone with small ears, and they stay put super well. Reviewer Parker Hall “had no problem doing hours of tree pruning and going on long sweaty runs in Portland's early fall heat wave.”\n\nWith some help from top-notch physical sound isolation, the active noise-canceling on these is just as good as Apple’s and even goes toe-to-toe with big hitters like Bose and Sony. The transparency mode works just as well, too, with a wider range and clearer audio than a lot of other headphones offer. When it's time to actually turn up the tunes, you can enjoy a wide, natural soundstage that has excellent detail in the midrange and clear, sparkling treble.\n\nThe Gemini integration, unfortunately, leaves a bit to be desired. It's not the smoothest experience, particularly when asking multiple questions, and the Pixel Buds Pro 2 aren't offering anything that other earbuds can't do. Apple's live translations and heart rate monitors are more useful features, but if you're on Android, you're locked out of them anyway.\n\nIf you're interested in upgrading your earbud game, and you already have a Pixel, you can grab the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in hazel for $180 from either Amazon or Best Buy. If that color doesn't suit you, I also spotted lesser discounts on the peony color for $189, or the porcelain color for $210. For anyone who isn't already sold on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, make sure to swing by our guide to the best wireless earbuds, with picks for both Apple and Android owners."

It combines the abilities of Google’s previous release, Nano Banana Pro—like text rendering and web searching—with speedier image generation. This tool will be the new default in Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n\nThe first image model from Google under the Nano Banana moniker dropped last August, and the Pro version arrived three months later. The AI tool was widely adopted online to alter photos of real people, from generating custom action figures to nostalgic images of people hugging younger versions of themselves.\n\nNano Banana 2 is not only faster at crafting images, it’s also a more powerful photo editor. Despite some rough edges and unconvincing generations in my initial hands-on experience through Gemini, Google’s latest release marks the continued improvement of photorealistic AI tools that can manipulate existing images and serves as a stark reminder to always scrutinize unverified images you see online.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIf you want to try the new image model, the easiest way to access Nano Banana 2 is through the Gemini app or website. You can either click the banana emoji to generate images or just put the request in your prompts to the chatbot. This new image model is also available through Google’s Search tools, AI Studio, Cloud, and other services.\n\nGoogle says the Nano Banana 2 image generator pulls real-time information from the web, which can be useful for generating infographics. To test this, I asked Gemini to generate a custom weather report for my upcoming weekend getaway. Here’s my prompt:\n\nI'm going skiing in Dodge Ridge this weekend with some friends. Could you create an infographic that covers the weather conditions?"

Wow.\n\nZoë Schiffer: OK. Leah, you go first.\n\nLeah Feiger: So my WIRED is the show Survivor, which is airing Wednesday night. So excited. This is going to be incredible. It is Season 50, so we have Survivor players of eons past that are coming back to compete for the million dollars. I am so excited. It's going to be incredible. Zoë, my goal in the next few months is just to make you watch one, one, of the episodes. This is very important to me.\n\nBrian Barrett: If you were to make Zoë watch a historical episode of Survivor in isolation, what one hour of Survivor would you show her?\n\nLeah Feiger: Can I say a season, or does it have to be an episode?\n\nBrian Barrett: I want to go with that, because I don't think you're going to get her for a whole season.\n\nLeah Feiger: So I'm going to do the second-to-last episode of the Micronesia season of Survivor. Absolutely incredible season, known for the Black Widow Brigade. Zoë, I actually think you would really like it. Well, anyway, that is my WIRED. My TIRED—and I'm kind of devastated to say this—is Love Is Blind, which is ... I know that my theme was reality shows this week. Look, I have a lot of I wouldn't say love for Love Is Blind, but I have a lot of interest in Love Is Blind. I am an avid Love Is Blind watcher. I think it is a super interesting concept and a very weird show and produces a lot of very weird people. But there is a excellent WIRED article coming out about how MAGA it's gotten, and that those are the people that are going on the show right now, and the conversations that are happening between these couples who met behind a wall and are off to get married several weeks after knowing each other, the conversations are quite sad. They're making me sad. There's a lot of body shaming and it's just very—it's weird. So this season, it's not doing it for me, which that's OK, because Survivor is here to lift me out of the doldrums. That is my WIRED and TIRED. I stand by it. I swear that I read books and stuff too. I do not want this to be my only brand on this show.\n\nZoë Schiffer: Certainly not. Brian, drag us out. I need to get on firmer ground.\n\nBrian Barrett: OK. Well, I'm going to go TIRED. Samsung just announced some new phones. Those aren't TIRED, but TIRED is AI overload in phones. There's too much. So at this point, the new Samsung Galaxy S26 smartphones—similar to Google's conversational photo editor—they have a photo assist thing that lets you use natural language, so you can just type in. If you have a photo that you took, you can say like, \"Hey, give my dog a party hat,\" and then there will be a party hat on the dog. What's the point of taking photos anymore? Why not just prompt something instead from scratch, or just go touch some grass? I am curious about—they've got agents built into the phone, so you can use the phone. You can just say, \"Hey, order me a pizza,\" and the phone will just do that for you. We'll see if it works. I don't know. It seems like it might go off the rails. Anyway, too much too soon for me. That's my TIRED. I didn't plan a WIRED. I was so caught up on the phone, but because it came up earlier, I'll say the new Muppet Show episode with Sabrina Carpenter is really quite good, and I hope that it got a good enough response that Disney makes more of them."

            "content": "AI agents like OpenClaw have recently exploded in popularity precisely because they can take the reins of your digital life. Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account.\n\nProvos notes that IronCurtain is designed to refine and improve each user's “constitution” over time as the system encounters edge cases and asks for human input about how to proceed. The system, which is model-independent and can be used with any LLM, is also designed to maintain an audit log of all policy decisions over time.\n\nIronCurtain is a research prototype, not a consumer product, and Provos hopes that people will contribute to the project to explore and help it evolve. Dino Dai Zovi, a well-known cybersecurity researcher who has been experimenting with early versions of IronCurtain, says that the conceptual approach the project takes aligns with his own intuition about how agentic AI needs to be constrained."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers."

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

            "content": "The projected shortage of memory chips worldwide will have a more serious impact on smartphone sales in 2026 than previously projected, according to new data from International Data Corporation Worldwide. Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

            "content": "During Nvidia's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said that agentic AI has reached \"an inflection point\" and that AI agents are \"solving real problems.\"\n\nThe company's powerful chips have been at the heart of the AI boom over the last few years, especially for use in data centers -- so much so that Nvidia's annual revenue for fiscal 2026 zoomed to $216 billion, up 65% from the previous year.\n\nHuang called Nvidia an AI infrastructure company, a dramatic evolution from the graphics card company it started as.\n\nThe term agentic AI has been floating around for some time, but now the technology is becoming available for real-world use. Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."

            "content": "Paramount Skydance appears set to win its bidding war against Netflix to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nLate Thursday, Netflix walked away from its planned acquisition of HBO, HBO Max, and Warner Bros. studios' business. The streaming giant said it \"had declined to raise its offer\" after Paramount submitted a revised all-cash bid of $31 per share on Tuesday to buy WBD in its entirety. WBD had reviewed the rival offer and announced that its board of directors found it \"superior\" to the Netflix agreement.\n\nNetflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement: \"At the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say: \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US.\"\n\nHowever, according to Netflix, the transaction was more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" at any price.\n\nIf approved, Paramount's new bid would see it not only pay $31 per share in cash, but also be on the hook for a $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe Netflix for backing out of its agreement. Additionally, Paramount would also be responsible for paying \"a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after Sept. 30, 2026,\" according to WBD, and pony up $7 billion should the deal not pass regulatory requirements.\n\nParamount's deal is backed by cash from Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nThe merger-acquisition plan between Netflix and WBD was originally announced on Dec. 5 for $83 billion (stocks and cash). The deal has since seen several takeover bids from Paramount, prompting Netflix to switch to an all-cash deal in January while Paramount engaged in a back-and-forth to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe announcement arrives on the day of WBD's Q4 earnings call, and the same day that Netflix's Sarandos visited Washington, DC, to meet with officials amid the Paramount bid.\n\nCNET's Corinne Reichert also contributed to this report."

            "content": "Instagram will soon alert some parents if their teen repeatedly tries to search for terms related to suicide or self-harm within a short period. Instagram owner Meta said on Thursday that it's rolling out the new notifications to parents in the US, UK, Australia and Canada, with other regions to follow later this year.\n\nThursday's update follows the 2024 introduction of teen accounts. It applies to parents using the platform's optional parental supervision setting, which requires consent from both teens and their parents to participate. Parental supervision allows parents to see the accounts their teen follows, set a time limit for how long their teen can use the app and more.\n\nIf teens repeatedly make suicide-related searches, parents will receive alerts via in-app notifications and email, text or WhatsApp, depending on available contact information. In addition to informing parents of their teen's searches, notifications will allow them to \"view expert resources designed to help them approach potentially sensitive conversations with their teen,\" according to Meta.\n\nAn example of the alerts. Meta\n\nMeta said it would prompt an alert if a teen attempted to search for phrases promoting suicide or self-harm and phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves. The company said its policy is to block searches for self-harm and suicide content and direct people to resources and helplines.\n\nThis move by Instagram is just one of many digital safety measures aimed at protecting young people online. It comes as governments push their own guardrails: Australia recently enacted the world's first ban on social media accounts for children under 16, and the United Kingdom is considering similar restrictions. These efforts reflect a broader trend toward embedding protective technologies and policies around young people and their online use, even as debates about privacy, autonomy, and effectiveness continue."

            "content": "Samsung has introduced three new S26 handsets at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year: the S26, the S26 Plus and the uber premium S26 Ultra. The S26 Ultra continues the company's tradition of Ultra handsets that offer top-of-the-line features that are lacking from the rest of their respective series. And this year, the Ultra's Privacy Display is the clear highlight feature, allowing you to customize how visible your phone is to others around you.\n\nAside from that, the S26 Ultra's other improvements are somewhat marginal. Yes, it's now made out of aluminum, the screen is a touch bigger, a 16GB RAM option is available, the processor is improved and the charging speeds are faster, but the rest of the S26 Ultra's features are similar to that of the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Even the price remains the same at $1,300.\n\nHere is how the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra compares with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nWatch this: First Look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra: Camera, Battery and AI Updates 02:56\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra only has a marginally larger screen compared to the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra have 6.8-inch AMOLED screens with 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution, while the new S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display also with a 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution. All three screens have a 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nBut it's the pixel-level Privacy Display that's particularly impressive with the S26 Ultra. When activated, the display will remain visible when looking directly at the phone while making it difficult to impossible to see what's on screen from the side. In addition to letting you turn the feature on and off for different apps, you can even have the Privacy Display activate exclusively for notifications while keeping the rest of the screen plainly visible.\n\nThe S26 Ultra's screen uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 cover glass, while the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra both use Gorilla Glass Armor. Gorilla Glass Armor 2 is said to be more scratch and drop resistant compared to its earlier version.\n\nSize-wise, the S26 Ultra is a touch bigger but also a touch thinner compared to its predecessors. CNET Senior Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti describes the new design as feeling thinner and lighter than prior Ultra phones during her hands-on time. It measures 6.44 by 3.07 by 0.31 inches, while the S25 Ultra's dimensions are 6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and the S24 Ultra measures 6.4 by 3.11 by 0.34 inches. Also, the S26 Ultra has an aluminum frame. That's a departure from the titanium frame found on both the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nThe cameras on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCameras\n\nWhile the S26 Ultra certainly has the best camera hardware of the S26 lineup, it has the same exact camera specs as its predecessors. All three Ultra phones have four cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto. That said, the S26 Ultra does have larger apertures and to capture better low-light photos. They also all have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nMany of the S26 Ultra's camera upgrades come from software. There's the Horizontal Lock feature that'll keep the horizon steady while shooting video, selfies can now capture more natural skin tones and screenshots will now be sorted into its own categories within the Gallery.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nBattery, processor and RAM\n\nAll three Ultra phones have a 5,000 mAh battery, but the charging speeds differ. The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra have 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, while the new S26 Ultra has 60W of wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Just like the S25 Ultra, the S26 Ultra does not include magnets but can support magnetic charging accessories when using a case that includes them.\n\nThe processors in the Ultra phones also get progressively faster and more efficient with each generation. The S24 Ultra has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the S25 Ultra uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and the S26 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy.\n\nWhile all three Ultra handsets come in three storage capacity options -- 256GB, 512GB and 1TB -- the S26 Ultra is the only one with a 16GB RAM option. (This ships with the 512GB and 1TB options.) The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra only ship with 12GB of RAM.\n\nCheck out the below chart to compare more details between the S26 Ultra, S25 Ultra and S24 Ultra."
