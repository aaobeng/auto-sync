            "content": "PFA boss Maheta Molango fears Cole Palmer risks being burned out by the demands on him.\n\nEngland ace Palmer was the star of Chelsea’s Club World Cup triumph last summer.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the attacking midfielder, 23, has missed more than half of Chelsea’s 42 games this season after a series of injuries.\n\nHe has only been available for one of Thomas Tuchel’s 10 games as England boss, the 1-0 summer win over Andorra.\n\nAnd while Palmer returned to goal scoring form with a hat-trick at Wolves and eighth Prem goal of the campaign in the home draw with Leeds, Molanga admitted he is really concerned about the impact of so much football.\n\nThe PFA boss, speaking at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit, said: “The concern is of course player welfare.\n\n\n\n“When I look at someone like Cole Palmer, if he goes to the World Cup that’s three consecutive summers without a break.\n\n“People say he’s a millionaire. Yes, he is\n\n“But it doesn’t give you an extra lung or an extra leg.\n\n“I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he’s the one who makes me dream.\n\n\n\nBEST FREE BETS AND BETTING SIGN UP OFFERS\n\n“But the reality is that the fans pay right now 100 per cent of the ticket price and a lot of time they get 70 per cent, if they’re lucky, of the show because players start regulating themselves and it’s not good.\n\n“Christmas is nice because it’s not every Tuesday.\n\n“We need to discover that – because we thought in football that more is more and, actually, sometimes less is more.”\n\nMolango added: “The problem is that each competition organiser just looks at their competition in isolation and the problem is that they don’t talk to each other.\n\n\n\n“In which sensible head does it fit that you can have someone playing the Champions League on the 31st of May within four days then go for a 10-day window with the national team.\n\n“And then within four days be expected to be in the US to play the Club World Cup that finishes on the 14th of July to then be back within two weeks for training.\n\n“I was at the training camp of Chelsea at the start of the season.\n\n“When they came back they were shattered. This is just the reality.\n\n“Is this what we wanted as an industry? I’m not sure. Sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.”"

            "content": "FORMER Manchester United trio Carlos Tevez, Patrice Evra and Park Ji Sung showed their friendship is still going strong after a wholesome reunion.\n\nThe ex-Red Devils all met up in Argentina this week and posed for a photo together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group, who became pals after Tevez signed for United in 2007, can be seen smiling and embracing alongside a fourth friend.\n\nEarlier this week former United left-back Evra posted a picture of the three holding the Premier League trophy.\n\nHe revealed that he was travelling to Argentina with Park for a catch up with Tevez.\n\nEvra wrote: “On the way to #BuenosAires with Park Ji Sung to see our brother @_carlitostevez Aka Apache. Vamos Argentina!”\n\n\n\nThe trio have shared a special bond from their days at Old Trafford – even though Tevez only spent two years at the club before leaving for Man City in 2009.\n\nPark previously told United’s official website of how the three became friends because they “felt comfortable” together – despite not all speaking the same language.\n\nThe former South Korea star said: “I don’t really know how Patrice and I became close friends, but it happened over time.\n\n“Then, when Carlos Tevez arrived in 2007, the three of us became close. Again, I just don’t know why!\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\n“He spoke Spanish, Patrice can speak Spanish as well, and suddenly we were friends.\n\n“Even though I can’t communicate with Carlos because I can’t speak Spanish and he couldn’t speak English at that time, Patrice just translated all of our conversations!\n\n“Every time we would get together for dinner, at the hotel and even during the warm-up before the match, we three would always warm up together.\n\n“We were just always together. On the plane to Champions League games, on the train to an away game in England, we would always sit together.\n\n\n\n“We were all comfortable. Everyone should be comfortable together with someone, and even though we couldn’t communicate straight away we just felt very comfortable around each other as a three.”\n\nEvra backed up Park’s claims during a recent interview with ex-team-mate Rio Ferdinand.\n\nHe told Rio Ferdinand Presents: “I was translating the Spanish of Carlito to Ji. But we just had so much fun and we bond and we still like talking to each other.\n\n“[Sir Alex Ferguson] used to call us ‘The Good, The Bad and the Ugly’. Ji was the good… someone was the ugly, but it wasn’t me!”\n\nDuring their trip, Evra and Park also bumped into Brazilian twins Fabio and Rafael – who both played at full-back for United – after jetting out to Brazil.\n\n\n\nFabio reposted a picture of the twins posing with Evra and Park, writing: “It’s a pleasure to welcome you to Brazil, legends!”\n\nEvra and Park were both the longest-serving members of the group of friends, playing 379 and 205 times for United respectively.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nTevez, meanwhile, featured in just 99 games for the Red Devils before spells with rivals City, Juventus and later Boca Juniors.\n\nHe is currently the manager of Argentinian side Talleres, who play in the country’s top division."

The current interim boss was still in the first team when Rashford exploded onto the scene as a teenager.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe then-18-year-old made his first appearance under Louis van Gaal in the Europa League. He was handed the start after striker Anthony Martial sustained an injury in the warm-up before facing FC Midtjylland.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRashford scored twice to secure United's last-16 place and establish his status as one of United's newest stars. After he netted two and set up the third in a 3-2 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League just three days later, people really saw his potential.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt was at this point that Carrick offered the young Rashford some sound but firm advice. He said: \"Watch yourself now. Enjoy it but you're going to get a lot of media attention; everyone's going to know you.\n\nMan Utd’s debt rises AGAIN as worrying numbers paint grim picture for Sir Jim Ratcliffe READ MORE :\n\n\"You've gone from no one knowing who you are to a potential superstar.\"\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThese words proved significant as Rashford would go on to become one of the first names on the teamsheet and a modern club legend. The forward has made 426 appearances for the club, netting 138 goals and providing 79 assists.\n\nView 3 Images The interim boss may consider bringing Rashford back (Image: OLI SCARFF, AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHowever, after a public spat with former manager Ruben Amorim and a significant drop in form, Rashford was loaned out to Aston Villa before making a temporary switch to Barcelona this season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHis contract at the Spanish club includes a £26million option to buy, which they are reportedly considering activating in the summer. The 27-year-old has made a strong impression at Barca, contributing to 23 goals in 34 appearances.\n\nCarrick's comments could indicate a potential return for Rashford at United, as the interim boss clearly holds the forward in high regard. Despite all indications pointing towards a permanent departure, former teammate Juan Mata believes his childhood affection for the club could outweigh all the challenges Rashford has encountered.\n\nHe said: \"It's not easy to handle with all the expectations and the pressure at the club like Man United but I think people will realise that he was a kid and he was a man who gave everything for the club he supported since he was a kid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images However, Barcelona are keen to keep the English forward (Image: Judit Cartiel, Getty Images)\n\n\"You can see photos of him when he was almost a baby with a Man United shirt on. So it meant a lot for him to play for Man United. You could see that.\n\n\"I think he gave great moments and great memories for many fans.

The defender sustained an injury mere days after finalising his move to become a Liverpool player, though.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe 20-year-old picked up what seemed to be a shoulder injury on February 7 during Rennes' 3-0 loss to Lens in Ligue 1, which was described as \"serious\" by the club's former boss Habib Beye.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"We'll have time to see, but it's definitely quite serious for both of them,\" Beye told reporters at the time. \"For Jeremy, it's his shoulder, and for Abdelhamid [Ait Boudlal] it's muscular.\"\n\nArne Slot shares concerning Florian Wirtz injury update with star out of West Ham clash READ MORE :\n\nNow, nearly three weeks following the injury, an update on Jacquet's injury has emerged from Rennes' new manager, Franck Haise, who has confirmed the defender will miss his side's fixture against Toulouse this weekend, reports the Liverpool Echo.\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I don't know exactly yet, he (Jacquet) is receiving treatment and rehabilitation, that's where we are at the moment, he's working in the gym,\" Haise stated on Thursday, via L’Equipe.\n\nIt remains uncertain how long Jacquet will be unavailable with his present injury and whether he will represent Rennes again before departing the club at season's end to join Liverpool.\n\nAt the beginning of this month, Arne Slot was quizzed about Jacquet, with the Liverpool manager stating: “Very pleasing, of course, because first of all he is a very big talent – and maybe even more than ‘only’ a talent, but we speak about talent because of his age, of course.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Jeremy Jacquet suffered a shoulder injury earlier this month (Image: Emilian Baldow/Icon Sport via Getty Images)\n\n“Second of all because we weren’t the only one interested in him, so another big compliment for the people that are working every single day so hard to sign players, that we were able to sign such a big talent.\n\n“And [it is] another example of the model we are using at this club: so, young, very talented players, sometimes in the start of their career, sometimes already a little bit a few years into their career, but always players that are young and can improve us and help us for the short, but definitely also for the long term.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“We have signed a lot of them recently and I’ve said many times that the mid- to long-term, but even the short-term, future of this club is in a very, very, very good place.”\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.\n\nClick here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings."

            "content": "Liverpool's 20th league title and their return to the Champions League allowed them to post record-breaking revenues that surged past the £700m mark for the first time.\n\nIn the latest accounts, which were published this morning, the Premier League champions' overall revenue increased by a whopping £89m to a total of £703m, which is the highest of any club in the Premier League.\n\nLiverpool posted an after-tax profit of £8m, which is a huge turnaround from the previous year's loss before tax of £57m.\n\nA significant factor in the increase has been media revenue, which jumped up £60m to £264m, due, in part, to the Reds' return to the Champions League, where they were eliminated in the last 16 by eventual winners Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nLiverpool are believed to have earned just short of £84m for their run to the knockout stages last season as they finished top of the inaugural group stage of the revamped and more lucrative European Cup before falling on penalties to PSG.\n\nThe Reds reportedly earned a fraction short of £175m for winning the Premier League, with prize money consisting of UK and international broadcast payments, equal shares, commercial revenues and facility fees. As many of 30 of their 38 league games were also broadcast, which is reflected in the media revenue uptick.\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nAdministrative costs, however, rose considerably, with the £57m increase bringing the overall figure to £657m and staff costs also jumped by £42m to £428m. It's believed that staffing expenses have doubled in under 10 years, whilst year-on-year utility bills at Anfield have surged by 107% across the past four campaigns.\n\nLiverpool contested two fewer fixtures last term compared to Jurgen Klopp's final season in 2023/24, yet match-day income still climbed by £14m to £116m.\n\nThis was predominantly down to the reporting window encompassing the first complete campaign with the new Anfield Road stand fully functioning, enabling the Reds to consistently welcome crowds topping 60,000.\n\nMeanwhile, the club's commercial division recorded a comparable uplift, generating £322m altogether. The £15m improvement in those numbers is connected to the club's continued dedication to staging some of music's biggest stars, with the accounting timeframe including shows from Pink and Taylor Swift, who performed three nights at Anfield last June during the blockbuster Eras Tour.\n\nFresh collaborations with Japan Airlines, Engelbert Strauss, Lucozade, and Swedish garden equipment company Husqvarna all helped drive commercial income upwards, whilst Liverpool also extended their longstanding arrangement with beer supplier Carlsberg, which, after 42 years, represents the Premier League's longest partnership of its type. The financial year, spanning through to 31st May 2025, doesn't feature the club's decade-long deal with kit manufacturers Adidas, which formally kicked off on 1st August last year.\n\nImage: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images) Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images)\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE! Latest Reds news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nThe partenership with the German powerhouse is valued at comfortably over £600m for the club across the coming ten years and will appear in next year's accounts.\n\nThe overall numbers will be seen as a significant triumph for the Reds, who persist in functioning under the self-sufficient framework of proprietors Fenway Sports Group.\n\nLiverpool FC's chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham, said: \"We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it.\n\n\"The 2024/25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men's team winning our 20th league title.\n\n\"The challenge for us is to continue with our growth, through the incredible work that we do in areas such as our partnership portfolio and retail offerings, as well as continuing to diversify our focus to best serve our global fanbase.\n\n\"The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women's teams.\n\nImage: Getty Images) Getty Images)\n\n\"Since this reporting period we have invested significantly to continue to enhance our playing squads, investing in the club's present and in its future too.\"\n\nThe numbers undoubtedly enabled the Reds' recruitment team to undertake a record-breaking summer expenditure in the transfer window, where they shattered their transfer record twice to capture £116m Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen and Alexander Isak, who became the most costly player in British football history when he finalised a £125m move from Newcastle United on September 1.\n\nLiverpool invested approximately £450m last summer on revamping their playing squad and recouped roughly half of that through departures, though £35m of which may not be received, as the uncertainty surrounding Harvey Elliott's Aston Villa loan arrangement continues.\n\nThe Reds injected £7m into the local economy and assisted over 145,000 individuals through their official charity, the LFC Foundation.\n\nVia its Red Neighbours initiative, the Foundation also distributed over £500,000 worth of vital food hampers, stadium tours and match-day experiences, whilst supporting the provision of 1,000 complimentary meals per week in the community.\n\n\"We're also extremely proud of our ongoing and impactful work in communities through LFC Foundation and via our award-winning sustainability programme, The Red Way,\" added Reds chief Beacham.\n\n\"As always, we're fully committed to operating in accordance with football's financial rules and regulations, whilst continuing our focus on providing the best possible platform for success on and off the pitch for our supporters here in Liverpool and around the world.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Spectators could be heard crying out \"It's just a game\" and \"You've got your boys watching\" as several adults grappled and threw punches.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBoth clubs confirmed over the weekend that internal investigations had been launched. Trefelin BGC has since announced that its inquiry has concluded, with those involved receiving lifetime bans from the club, reports Wales Online.\n\nIn a statement posted on social media, the club said: \"Following the incident on the weekend, an internal investigation has been conducted, and individuals involved have been handed a life ban by Trefelin BGC.\n\nLionel Messi rugby tackled as pitch invader beats security to superstar in alarming incident READ MORE :\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Further investigations are in the hands of the relevant governing bodies. We will not be making any further comments.\"\n\nAberkenfig BGC had previously described themselves as \"extremely disappointed\" by the incident and issued an apology to match officials, players and the wider football community, confirming they would put together a full report for the relevant authorities.\n\nView 2 Images A fight breaks out between adult spectators during the Under-14s Welsh football match\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a statement published on Sunday evening, Trefelin BGC said: \"As a club we have been made aware of an incident on social media. Trefelin BGC certainly don't condone this behaviour and are awaiting reports from the relevant match and league officials.\n\n\"We are also conducting an internal investigation. Updates will be made in due course.\"\n\nThe governing bodies are now understood to be looking into the matter, with the possibility of additional sanctions following their review. The incident is thought to have taken place shortly after a player was dismissed late in the match, though both clubs have emphasised that investigations remain ongoing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe footage sparked widespread outrage across social media, with many voicing alarm at the example being set in front of young players. Further developments are anticipated once the governing bodies bring their inquiries to a close.\n\nSky Sports discounted Premier League and EFL package This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

George has got the team around him. Kimi [Antonelli] will be stronger this year in the other car, but George is completely out of Lewis [Hamilton]'s shadow there, he's the king of the castle at Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\"He did all those years at Williams and then he went to Mercedes when they just stopped dominating, so he's done the hard yards.\n\n\"I think he's got the experience, he's got the car control, and I think he will command the respect in the team to help drive what's going to be an incredibly changeable year.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Craig Slater and Martin Brundle review and rank all the F1 teams after pre-season testing\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Sky Sports News, Brundle added: \"I think his team-mate Kimi Antonelli will have a great season as well, but George has got all the confidence he needs to win races and to go and win a championship, if it's available to him.\n\n\"We questioned that with Lando [Norris] last year, and Oscar [Piastri] too, whether they would wilt under pressure from Max [Verstappen], and they didn't.\n\n\"I think George is in a very good place.\"\n\nAsked how Russell would handle any increased intra-Mercedes challenge from team-mate Kimi Antonelli, the 19-year-old Italian entering his second year of F1, Brundle added: \"Remember, [Russell] grew up in Lewis Hamilton's shadow at Mercedes, and he handled that, and eventually in the final year they were team-mates, he beat Lewis clearly.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Russell admits his two starts in Bahrain have been 'worse' than his worst-ever start in Formula 1\n\n\"So, I have no doubts about him whatsoever. They're all world-class drivers in F1, you've got to beat them somehow.\n\n\"I think George has got so much experience now despite not being 30 yet, that I don't think anything will distract him if he's got a championship-winning car.\"\n\n'No clear favourite' - Brundle expects open 'big-four' battle\n\nWhile Mercedes may be favourites for both titles heading into the 24-race campaign, Brundle believes they will face a challenge from all three of their established rivals on the evidence of the three winter tests.\n\n\"I see Ferrari being strong, I see both Ferrari drivers being strong,\" said Brundle.\n\n\"I think both McLaren drivers will be strong as well. Oscar will come back on a mission after what he learned last year; Lando, I don't think I've ever seen him yet not with that big grin on his face so far this year, he's just got that comfort now.\n\n\"The Red Bull looks really strong, and we know how Max's car control, which you'll need with these cars, will be incredible.\n\n\"So, for me, there's not a clear favourite.\"\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

Only at this meeting can the laws of the game be amended, and they then have to be applied worldwide.\n\nHowever, the IFAB board may decide to trial some law changes rather than introduce them permanently, with those laws made optional for individual competitions to consider implementing. While any law changes will not come into effect until July 1 (so, effectively for the start of the next domestic football season) it is likely that FIFA will choose to introduce some of them, as a trial, during this summer's World Cup in North America.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Currently, the Premier League has the lowest intervention rates for VAR of any of the 'big five' European leagues.\n\nFA chief executive Mark Bullingham has spoken publicly about his dislike for the idea, but Pierluigi Collina, FIFA's head of referees, is a strong advocate, arguing that VAR would only get involved in corners where there has been a clear and obvious error.\n\nThere is widespread belief in the game that the introduction of the 'eight-second rule' for goalkeepers has been a success in cracking down on time-wasting - largely because there have been very few incidents this season where a 'keeper has held the ball for more than eight seconds, and a corner has been awarded to the opponent as a result.\n\nBecause of that success, IFAB will discuss further measures to speed up stoppages in play.\n\nHow would the 'five-second' rule work?\n\nProposals include introducing a new 'five-second rule' for goal-kicks and throw-ins, whereby a player will have only a very short time to get the game back under way again, or face a penalty. If they go beyond the five seconds, the throw-in would be reversed and awarded to the opponent, and a goal-kick would become a corner for the attacking side.\n\nSome insiders have suggested that five seconds is too short a time for players to adhere to, and others fear long throws would be impossible to organise in that time-frame.\n\nSome referees are also likely to be concerned that, if they have to do visual countdowns for goalkeepers with the ball in-hand, and also for throw-ins and goal-kicks, that could cause too much distraction from their other match-ruling functions.\n\nOther laws on the IFAB agenda include the mandatory 30 seconds that a player must remain off the pitch once they have received treatment for an injury on it.\n\nThere is a proposal that this time should be doubled to one minute, to help player welfare, but also to act as a further deterrent to would-be time-wasters. Similarly, a time limit for substitutions could be introduced to try to help further speed up the game.\n\nAgain, the feeling among the home nations FAs seems to be that the 30-second rule for players receiving treatment is working effectively at present, and so there may be some resistance to this law being introduced, we are told.\n\nEach law change, after discussion, will be put to the vote on Saturday. There needs to be a 75 per cent majority for any proposal to be passed. Each of the home nation FAs has one vote each, with FIFA having four votes, meaning six of the eight votes has to be in favour, for a law to be amended."

Regis Le Bris’s side make the long trip to the south coast, hoping to arrest a run of three consecutive league defeats. “They’re a team that has played really well this season,” said Iraola of tomorrow’s opposition. “Their goalkeeper has been very good, he has a long kick and they can press very early. Every free kick, they put a lot of pressure on you.” Iraola told reporters that Lewis Cook will be out for an unspecified number of weeks with a hamstring injury.

The Egypt international has won the Golden Boot four times since arriving at Anfield in 2017, the latest in last season’s title-winning campaign but has gone nine league matches without finding the net. It’s his worst run in the English top flight but Slot said while the criticism was to be expected because of the 33-year-old’s high standards it was not a cause for a concern as it was a problem afflicting all his forwards. “He set his own standards and those are so high and the moment he doesn’t score for a few games people are immediately surprised – that is the biggest compliment he can get,” said Slot. “With data you can use it to your advantage or disadvantage but not to use the FA Cup game – if we play a Premier League side - you could argue if that is fair. “Three games ago he had an assist and a goal against a very good Premier League team in Brighton so that is the reality and then you can change data and say he did not score in nine Premier League games. We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and at this moment in time that is maybe the biggest difference in his performance and game time. But we also know this has happened before, I don’t know if it happened nine games in a row but I’ve had these questions earlier if he didn’t score for three or five but I know in the end he always starts scoring again. He is not our only attacker at this moment in time that doesn’t score as much as we are used to.” [Press Association] Share\n\n36m ago 05.24 EST Football Association news: Kevin Thelwell has been appointed the FA’s Elite Coach Developer, tasked with supporting the progression of elite homegrown coaches.

The Newcastle head coach’s record against Pep Guardiola (P22 W2 D2 L18) is pretty dismal, even if his side did beat them at St James’ Park in the Premier League earlier this season. “Really special and really positive for us,” he says. “I think we are just grateful we can’t get Man City!

Arne Slot has opened his pre-match presser by telling reporters that Florian Wirtz will not be fit for the game and there’s no confirmed time frame on the German’s return. Wirtz missed Liverpool’s somewhat fortuitous win against Nottingham Forest last weekend after being forced to pull out during the warm-up. “I don’t expect Florian to be available,” he says. “It’s a disappointment. Every time a player is not available is a disappointment, it’s something that I didn’t expect after last week. At this moment time, I don’t know [when he will return]. Usually when I say that, I do know and I don’t want to share. But this time, I honestly don’t know. “It’s a big accomplishment for Wirtz to stay fit for such a long time because he had to make a step up from where he played to the Premier League and Liverpool. It tells a lot about his mentality and work rate that he has stayed fit for so long. It is a disappointment for him and for us, because he has played really, really well lately” Slot also reveals that Jeremie Frimpong will be available for tomorrow’s match after being sidelined since the end of January.

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts have revealed.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”."

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

Amorim’s 14-month reign ended on 5 January after his public attack on United’s hierarchy, with his five coaches also leaving Old Trafford.\n\nA filing to the New York Stock Exchange revealed the potential payments to Amorim and his staff, a day after the club confirmed they had made a £32.6m profit in their second-quarter results to 31 December 2025.\n\nUnited listed it as an “event that occurred after the reporting period”, and said: “A charge of £6.3m for the write off of related intangible assets and a provision of £15.9m, representing the maximum potential amount of future settlement payments, will be recognised in the statement of profit or (loss) during the second half of the year ending 30 June 2026.”\n\nIt has been reported the maximum amount of £15.9m is dependent on certain factors, such as Amorim not getting a new job within a specific timeframe.\n\nThe accounts showed United have also paid Sporting £6.3m, which is what they owed the Portuguese club in compensation for hiring Amorim. United said in a November 2024 filing they were paying Sporting £10m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m.\n\nThe combined changes around Amorim’s appointment could cost United £36.3m. Amorim won 25 of his 63 games, finishing 15th in the Premier League, United’s worst performance since being relegated from the top flight in 1973-74.\n\nUnited were sixth in the Premier League when Amorim was dismissed, having had a major falling out with the director of football, Jason Wilcox, days before his final game at Leeds.\n\nThey have boosted their hopes of Champions League football next season under Michael Carrick, climbing to fourth with five wins and a draw."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL translators will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here.

We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance.

The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate. Agencies Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt was a long first half from a Forest perspective. The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, could not take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Strand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time.

Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

Now 40, the mum-of-three is as obsessed with the iconic show as ever and is one of the UK’s biggest superfans.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe followed Friends across Channel Four, Comedy Central and Netflix - flying into a panic when it was dropped from the streaming service earlier this year. This is because Nikki, from Aberdeen, relies on Chandler, Joey, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel and Ross’ voices to get her to sleep.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“It started in lockdown, I was really struggling with sleeping because of the uncertainty of everything, and was just feeling really wired,” the self-employed nail technician says. So one night, because it’s so familiar and I don’t have to concentrate on it, I put Friends on for comfort.\"\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Now Nikki pops an episode on her iPad every night - having had to buy them on Amazon Prime - just to nod off. Her 13-year-old Josh, does the same, playing it on his computer.\n\n“It’s the warmth and humour. It’s so comforting. They’ve been in my life now for so long that I just feel a real connection with the characters,” she says.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNikki has been all around the world in honour of her love for the show - visiting the apartments in New York in 2008 and 2024, and visiting the Warner Brothers Studio in LA to see the set with husband Kris. \"We’ve seen the stage and the original fountain, the sofa, and Central Perk Cafe. It was really cool,” she adds.\n\nAnd Nikki’s love of the show is even written on her body, where she has two Friends tattoos.\n\nView 5 Images A Friends tattoo for one fan (Image: Nikki Hardy/Cover Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNikki’s bedroom is home to a Friends shrine, crowded with memorabilia; bags, books, t-shirts, colouring sets and Funko Pop toys. She bought them all on Vinted before learning that McDonald’s is giving away collectibles along with the Friends Meal as part of a new campaign.\n\nBut she will be heading back to a restaurant to get more collectibles, thanks to the new McDonald’s Friends Meal. “When I was pregnant with my two youngest, I was obsessed with McDonald’s meals. I couldn’t get enough of them,” she laughs.\n\nThe limited-edition meal features one of six collectible characters for diners ordering a Bic Mac, nine McNuggets or a McPlant in restaurants nationwide.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere is also a chance to win four exclusive Friends inspired mugs, each with an iconic design, when you purchase the McDonald’s Friends Meal using the MyMcDonald’s Rewards app. The competition is open until March 16.\n\nView 5 Images Friends superfans (Image: Lucy Wilkinson/Cover Images)\n\nLike Nikki, Lucy Wilkinson has also been hooked on the TV show since she was a child, and she has interrupted her new year diet to visit McDonald’s to get her hands on a Friends Meal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt primary school, Lucy got the Rachel haircut and would sit down every Friday night to watch the show in the days before binge watching was a possibility.\n\n“I loved it. I had all the pencil cases and the board games, and even now, the first thing I do when I get home is put it on the TV”, the mortgage advisor from Sheffield, says.\n\nLucy - who is hyper organised and exceptionally tidy - self-identifies as Monica, and her love affair with the show has infiltrated her own relationships. Friends and family buy her Friends-themed gifts for birthdays and Christmas, she has a Friends shrine in her utility room, and her hen party and wedding in 2018 were dominated by the show.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images The iconic Friends sofa (Image: Nikki Hardy/Cover Images)\n\nShe’s even won a Friends quiz at the UK Central Perk tour in 2009. “I even put it on when we’re on holiday. My husband, Will, says ‘I can’t believe we’re abroad and we’re still watching Friends’”, Lucy, 39, says.\n\nAt her hen party in Tenerife six years ago, all her guests were given name badges in honour of Monica’s fastidiousness, and a laminated itinerary was pulled out.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It was called 'the one where Lucy got married', everyone was given their own Friends character to be and it was so much fun,\" she remembers.\n\nAnd at the couple’s wedding, guests were offered slices of cheese and pork pie cake, which bore the topper “he’s my lobster”, in reference to Phoebe Buffay’s description of Ross and Rachel’s relationship.\n\nThey signed the register to the background music of U2’s With or Without You - the song Ross and Rachel first kissed to - but Will drew the line at entering the reception to the Friends theme tune.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“He put his foot down on that”, she laughs, before admitting it did get played at the end of the night. When we got back to the bridal suite, there were pinecones and fake fruit everywhere. I didn’t realise why until the next morning when I worked out my friends had put them there in reference to Ross stealing them from a hotel lobby.\n\n“My whole life has revolved around this TV show. Even though we were trying not to eat fast food in February, we gave ourselves permission to have a Friends Big Mac meal. I was really pleased to get the Monica character, as she’s my favourite.\n\nThe McDonald’s Friends Meal will be available in restaurants until March 16 while stocks last."

Ian Cook’s car was registered by NCP’s number-plate recognition system on his first visit to Birmingham Airport’s premium set down car park\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThen when he visited three days later and exited again, he was charged for almost 80 hours of parking. The amount came to £1,955, which cleared his bank account, and the company that runs the facility has refused a refund until it has carried out an investigation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIan, 56, said: “I drop off and pick up my clients at Birmingham Airport well over 100 times a year using the Premium Set Down Car Park, for this reason I have set up an automatic payment account with the car park operators NCP. Usually their ANPR cameras clock me going in and out of the Premium Set Down drop off and they automatically take the fee (currently £6 per 15 minutes) and send me an invoice via email.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Ian made two drop-offs three days apart\n\n“On Monday ,February 16, I dropped off my clients around 12.30pm and was in and out in minutes as normal. I went back around 9pm on Thursday February 19 and again drove in and out in minutes. The next day I got an email invoice as usual but to my horror I had been charged £1,955 and they had already taken that money from my account. Apparently, I had parked in the Premium Set Down for three days, seven hours 45 minutes and 41 seconds!”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt this point Ian assumed he’d talk to a human and the error would be obvious and the money quickly returned. “I just thought it was just a mistake, and expected it to be rectified straight away,” said Ian\n\n“I contacted NCP immediately. Their ANPR cameras obviously didn't clock me leaving on Monday the 16th and cameras didn't pick me up again until the 19th. It would be ludicrous to assume I’d stayed in Premium Set Down all that time, and I thought NCP would see this was a system error and automatically refund me my £1,955 immediately, but that is not the case.\n\n“I spent most of the day on Friday on the phone to NCP customer services and each time being told somebody would call me back within 10 minutes, these calls never materialised. No one was helpful or seemed to care. Eventually I got told ‘You'll have to wait until we've done an investigation, and we'll get back to you with our findings.’ There was no indication of how long this would be.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I said, ‘You know, it's not 50 quid you've taken, you've taken nearly two grand.’ But there was no reaction or care, it’s like they’re reading off a script. The NCP staff that dealt with me don’t seem to be the full ticket,” added Ian.\n\nHe added: “If they had said ‘There was a camera on the blink, we'll get that money sent to you straight away’ and said sorry, I would have been understanding.” Ian is about to go on holiday with his wife Terry to Tenerife.\n\nView 3 Images Ian says he has not had an apology\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I work hard and was looking forward to a break, but my whole week’s been ruined,” he said. “It is disgraceful and not acceptable, I’m not even sure it's lawful. Their attitude is disgusting.”\n\nHe added: “Everyone is just trying to make money out of parking, it’s greed. It's like an extra tax. When I first started my private hire business almost 10 years ago, it was a pound to drop off at Birmingham airport, and it just keeps going up.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Heathrow have just put theirs up so Birmingham will usually copy. When my charges go up I have to offset the costs, so I have to pass that on to my customers. Last year I did 127 trips to Birmingham Airport, so it adds up.”\n\nNCP has now finally agreed to refund Ian. “We are sincerely sorry for the experience that Mr Cook had with us. This is an unusual situation, and we are currently investigating this to understand what happened to cause this. In the meantime, we can arrange a same day refund and have reached out to him to arrange that, and as soon as we hear back from him then the team can process the payment.”\n\nIan is still far from happy as NCP have not apologised to him, and the money had not actually appeared in his account.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHe said: “So I have been refunded, minus the £12 for parking. “No apology, no explanation as to what happened, no offer of compensation, just a ‘refund initiated’ receipt stating ‘please allow 10 days for your refund to be processed’.”"

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex travelled to the Middle East at the invitation of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe invitation was extended for the Sussexes to learn more over a two-day trip about the tireless humanitarian effort to support the health and wellbeing of displaced Syrians and Palestinians who have sought sanctuary in Jordan over many decades.

Your visit, your support, your appreciation of the efforts that the United Nations, including of course, the World Health Organisation, the government of Jordan and others, are making here is enormously appreciated.

Average pump prices have crept upwards over each of the past two weeks, following a steady decline since mid-December.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe average cost now stands at 131.71p per litre – rising from 131.46p on February 9, according to industry experts. They warned that the increase is being driven by global instability, with Brent crude surging above $71 per barrel – its highest point since July 2025 – fuelled by heightened tensions in the Middle East and the continuing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDonald Trump's tariffs are also sending shockwaves across global markets, they noted. Should a significant supply disruption occur – such as direct military involvement between the US and Iran, or a blockage of the Strait of Hormuz – prices could soar even further.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, costs remain well below the record high of 191.55p per litre seen in July 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTony Redondo, founder of Newquay-based Cosmos Currency Exchange, has called on Brits to top up their tanks whilst they still can, warning that pump prices will almost certainly continue to rise.\n\nView 3 Images Donald Trump's tariffs could play a part (Image: Pool, Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe continued: \"The recent rise to 131.71p per litre signals a definitive pause in the downward trend UK drivers enjoyed earlier this year. This uptick is primarily driven by global volatility, with Brent crude climbing above $71 per barrel – the highest since July 2025 – due to heightened tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n\"Domestically, while the 5p fuel duty cut remains in place until September 2026, retailers are rapidly passing these wholesale increases to the pumps. Barring a major supply disruption, such as direct military action involving the US and Iran or a blockage of the Strait of Hormuz, prices are expected to settle between 133p and 135p in the short term.\n\n\"While we aren't approaching the 191p record highs of 2022, the price 'floor' has likely been reached. It is wise to fill up now if you find a station near the current average, as retail prices typically rise much faster than they fall.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSamuel Mather-Holgate, managing director and IFA at Swindon-based Mather and Murray Financial, warned motorists could face prices reaching £2 per litre by summer's end.\n\nView 3 Images Drivers are being warned (Image: PA)\n\nHe said: \"Donald Trump's tariffs really are felt across the globe, even if indirectly, in petrol prices. Increasing uncertainty on the world stage pushed up the price of the commodity that is still the engine juice of the world.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"With tariffs, global political uncertainty in the Middle East and the problem of Venezuela, it's anyone's guess how much crude might go up. It's not unthinkable that we could see up to £2 per litre in the UK by the end of the summer.\"\n\nSteven Greenall, an adviser at Rayleigh-based Protect and Lend, warned that escalating geopolitical tensions across the globe could push prices even higher.\n\nHe explained: \"With oil up over 8% on the exchanges over the last month, it's unsurprising petrol is ticking up at the pumps. Tension rising in the Middle East and potential threats to shipping through the Straits of Hormuz are causing some jitters. If further conflict breaks out, expect further upward pressure, but I'd expect it to be temporary.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Charlotte Redsell was found in her flat in Strood, Kent after saying she didn't ' belong in this world'\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCharlotte's brother Stephen, 33, said they had had a traumatic childhood, losing their mother when they were very young and then their dad during Covid. The experience left them scarred and struggling with anxiety and health issues\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said Charlotte was a much-loved and highly-respected restaurant manager, who had been planning to open her own business, preparing to tak e her driving test and was looking forward to a Reiki class the day after she died.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Charlotte was planning to open her own business\n\nStephen said it was clear now that she had “suffered in silence.” He said: “I can see she was very protective of her emotions. Charlotte was thoughtful and generous and would give her last couple of quid to someone rather than see them go without. She may not be with us, but she can still be inspiring. Charlotte still has a voice.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCharlotte was just 10 when she lost her mum. After leaving school, Stephen took her under his wing and, through his contacts, got her jobs in restaurants.\n\nHe said she was a “natural“ and soon rose through the ranks from floor supervisor and kitchen staff to front of house and manager. She worked at a number of venues and eventually moved to Fish at 55, a seafood restaurant in Rochester, where Stephen was a chef.\n\n“I'm so proud of her. She loved her job, and it kept her busy,” he said. “She was chasing her dreams of opening a coffee shop.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Charlotte with her brother Peter after taking his son to an Arsenal game\n\nCharlotte’s death left her colleagues and customers in shock and an impromptu floral shrine sprang up outside the restaurant where she worked. Messages said she had brought joy to many and would be deeply missed. “Such a beautiful young lady. She was such a lovely girl,” one tribute read.\n\nAn inquest in Maidstone held last week heard that Charlotte was found at home by her sister Chantelle on October 8 last year. The 24-year-old had become concerned about a message she had received a few hours before and gone round to check if everything was alright.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA toxicology report showed Charlotte had alcohol and painkillers in her blood. There were no signs of third-party involvement. Among her last words to those close to her were: “Some people don't belong in this world - and that’s me.”\n\nView 5 Images Tributes have been left at Charlotte's workplace\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIan Potter, area coroner for Mid-Kent and Medway, told the family: “I’m so sorry for your loss. At the age of 26, Charlotte was far too young.”\n\nHe added that he was satisfied from the messages on her phone that she had intended to take her own life and recorded the cause of death as suicide. The family are now trying to come to terms with their sister’s death and plan to raise awareness of mental health issues.\n\nLike Charlotte, Stephen has battled with alcohol problems and is proud that he’s now two years sober. Both turned to the mental health charity Mind for support and he is joining Peter and Charlotte’s friend Rachael on a Three Peaks challenge to raise money for the organisation in September.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Tributes for Charlotte\n\nYou can donate here: https://www.justgiving.com/page/in-spirit-of-charlotte-redsell?utm_medium=FR&utm_source=EM&utm_campaign=020\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

Mum Alice believes Willow contracted it after being in the sea that day.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe severity of the illness meant Willow having to miss being a bridesmaid at her aunt’s wedding, something she had hugely been looking forward to.\n\nTheir experience come amid heightened attention of what campaigners say are the heath risks of swimming in the seas because of the dumping of raw sewage by water companies.\n\nView 3 Images Alice Clarke believes daughter Willow caught nasty vomiting bug after spending just 20 minutes in the sea\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChannel 4 docu-drama Dirty Business featuring the heart-wrenching story of eight-year old Heather Preen, who two weeks after contracting e.coli along with many others during a trip to a Devon beach in 1999. Her family feel certain Heather’s death was the result of her coming into contact with raw sewage. South West Water has always denied culpability.\n\nAlice Clarke, her sister, and Willow - who was six at the time - visited Carlyon Bay, near St Austell, in Cornwall on August 19 last year.\n\nAlice, who was self-employed cleaner and is now a special needs teaching assistant, said: “We probably weren’t in the sea for more than 20 minutes. In that time she didn’t swallow any of the water. It was very strange that she contracted it,” says Alice, who thinks the only way the bacteria got into Willow’s system was because she ate someone after being in the sea, adding: “The bacteria may have been on hands. Within two or three hours of being in the water she was really, really tired. She just wanted to go to bed. Considering we were on holiday, that wasn’t like her. And we had only just arrived that day. All through that night she had a really high temperature. She was sweating all night.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Alice Clarke and daughter Willow had been looking forward to a seaside break together\n\nBy 10.30am the next morning, Willow had begun vomiting, and Alice made the decision to rush home, more than 80 miles away in Silverton, Devon, a journey that took two hours. She recalls: “From then on she was vomiting every one to two hours, through the night as well, for pretty much 12 days straight. There were only a couple of breaks in between. It was awful, traumatising. She was so dehydrated as well.”\n\nAlice says that, after around five days, she took Willow to a walk-in client but was advised to simply go home and lie down. A few days later, and with no improvement, she took Willow to her local doctor who suspected it was cryptosporidium, and later confirmed. Fortunately Willow began to improve on day 12, otherwise Willow would have had to be hospitalised.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“While she was going through it, she was so tired, I don’t think she understood the severity of it. It was after she started gaining her energy that she said, ‘I was really scared because I didn’t know if this was ever going to end, and I was scared I might have actually died’.\n\nWhile Willow has recovered physically, the mental scars remain. “She will go onto the sand but won’t go near the sea, she won’t even paddle,” says Alice. “And I’m not allowed to do that either. She is very scared because of her experience. Neither of us will set foot in the sea again, and we used to go in a lot. Even me talking about it, she gets upset. This will stay with her forever.”\n\nAlice is convinced being in the sea was how Willow became ill: “There is no other possible way she could have got it. There is no other explanation. We were in a campervan and we took bottled water away with us.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHaving to take so much time off work to care for Willow also took its toll: “As a self-employed single parent, I couldn’t work for three weeks which caused real financial strain. No family should go through this.”\n\nSouth West Water said: “We are sorry to hear that someone has been unwell however, we do not have a storm overflow on Carlyon Bay”.\n\nThere is still the possibility the parasite was in the water from elsewhere. The UK Health Security Agency said there was evidence suggesting cryptosporidium can survive for at least 12 weeks in seawater. It pointed that this based on studies using artificial seawater."

And the Prime Minister owns his party’s disappointing third place behind them and Reform - more on them in a mo - because Keir Starmer blocked popular Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham from standing because he wanted his job as PM not just be an MP.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLabour’s soul searching won’t be pretty yet is absolutely necessary when the post-mortem must conclude that governing full-throated as social justice warriors rather than timidly is the answer. We heard the unmistakable sound of another nail hammered into Starmer’s political coffin, numerous unforced errors denying the PM a hearing from electors who’ve decided they don’t like him.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“This result must be a wake up call. It’s time to really listen and to reflect,” concluded Angela Rayner. The alarm is ringing loudly. Ignoring it would be Labour inviting destruction.\n\nOPINION Lizzy Buchan 'Labour's devastating result in Gorton and Denton is a grim sign of trouble ahead'\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAlso decisively rejected were Tory tribute act Nigel Farage and a Reform UK whose bandwagon hasn’t only stopped but is rolling backwards nationally in the polls as an increasingly scrutinised Hard Right repels decent folk. The combined Labour and Greens progressive total was double that of the authoritarian nationalists, Left trouncing Right, and the Greens undoubtedly benefited(and Labour suffered) from tactical voting to keep out Reform.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

I usually go into the polling station with my partner. When my adult kids lived at home, they came along too. Nobody complained about “family voting” by us. Perhaps it’s because we’re White skinned and not Muslims.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhat about the Conservatives? Totally irrelevant, losing their deposit. Kemi Badenoch’s improved her game but her party’s eclipsed on the Right by Reform and isn’t at the races. Memories of 14 years of austerity, chaos and failure are unwiped. The Greens could arguably be shooting stars, shining brightly at the mo then destined to burn out. George Galloway’s victories at the head of Left-wing parties in Bethnal Green, Bradford West and Rochdale proved short-lived.\n\nThis feels different in an age when allegiances to Labour and the Conservatives are fraying rapidly. Labour with a radically fresh approach under a more charismatic new leader could rise again, recovery possible if MPs and Ministers show the bottle to do what’s required.\n\nThat’s another reason British politics will never be the same again. Labour changes for the better or the Greens grow. Maybe both happen. Reform? Farage prematurely measured the curtains in No 10."

She explained how her puppy can go from peacefully relaxing on the sofa to barking at the top of her lungs within seconds, leaving the woman startled by the unexpected outburst.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSo, in a bid to teach her dog a lesson, she playfully mimicked the behaviour and shared the pooch’s reaction in an Instagram video. In the clip, the owner is seen sitting on the bed with her dog by her side when, out of nowhere, she starts barking. The confused sausage dog quickly turns its head towards her, gives her a sharp side-eye, and then settles back down.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHer video was captioned: “Barking at my dog to show her how terrifying it is when it’s done out of nowhere… at nothing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“If looks could kill. Only another 2,673,889 times to go till we’re even Stevens.”\n\nCommenting on her post, one user joked: “Her flabbers were fully gasted.” Another wrote: “Pup: ‘I beg your finest pardon?’”\n\nA third said: “If I hadn’t lost years off my life to my dog’s random barking, I would think this was mean.” One more added: “Her ears told an entire story.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile some dog owners might find the trend amusing, the American Kennel Club warns it can be harmful – particularly if repeated for entertainment.\n\nIn a statement, the organisation said: “The ‘bark at your dog’ trend has become very popular on TikTok, with millions of views on videos from dozens of popular users.\n\n“Seeing these popular videos inspires people to try this at home with their own dogs, hoping to capture a ‘funny’ response to upload onto TikTok.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“The problem is that while the videos might be getting a lot of attention, the challenge involves engagement that can be very stressful or upsetting for dogs.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n“Unfortunately, the popular ‘funny’ responses people are trying to get from their dogs are actually not funny at all.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“Most of the popular posts in response to this trend involve dogs displaying signs of stress, fear or discomfort, such as ‘whale eye’, where their eyes are opened very wide, a stiff body posture, tense facial features and pinned-back ears.\n\n\"In these videos, some dogs bark or vocalise back at their owners, lick their lips – which can be a calming signal as they attempt to defuse a situation they find uncomfortable – or even show their teeth or try to move away.”\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one.

Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God. May his wife Cindy, family and friends find comfort with the support of the so many who loved Ruben. Rest in eternal peace.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Wayne Rooney has revealed that he was once given a neck tie in a Manchester restaurant by Argentine football legend Diego Maradona - after arriving at the hot-spot 'fuming' with Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nThe former Manchester United star was recounting his favourite grounds to play at on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, and named Real Madrid's Bernabeu as his number one, going on to accompany his choice with a memorable recollection of playing there.\n\n'We got a good result,' Rooney said as he recalled the Red Devils' round-of-16 match against the Spaniards in 2013. 'Danny Welbeck scored a header, I crossed it in for a corner, Welbeck scored and we drew the game 1-1.'\n\nBut despite a strong showing on the road, United's legendary boss Ferguson was unwilling to extend the same role to Rooney in the return fixture.\n\n'He left me on the bench for the return leg. Alex Ferguson pulled me in and told me I was going to be on the bench, which I was fuming with, because I played out of position, I did a job for the team, helped us get a good draw away from home, and we got beat (2-1 on the night).'\n\nMore memorably however was what happened in the aftermath, with Rooney stunning his co-hosts with details about his subsequent trip to Premier League footballer favourite, Chinese restaurant Wing's.\n\nImagine walking into a restaurant in Manchester and Maradona's just standing there 😂 pic.twitter.com/3S7dHk8nxs — BBC Sport (@BBCSport) February 27, 2026\n\nWayne Rooney has recounted the strange circumstances of his 2013 meeting with Diego Maradona at a Manchester restaurant\n\n'It was that evening actually - I went to Wing's restaurant in my tracksuit, and Maradona was in there,' Rooney said. 'I got a picture with him and stuff.\n\n'He had a full suit on, and tie, and then he gave me his tie. It was a bit weird, he took his tie off, put it on me, my club tracksuit still on.'\n\nMaradona had been at Old Trafford that evening, but had likely been a regular visitor to the city at the time due to his daughter Giannina being married to Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.\n\nThe Napoli icon had previously hailed Rooney at the start of his career, sharing 10 years before their meeting that he was a 'special talent that the English should cherish'.\n\n'They don't come along that often, players who can go on and become real world-class stars,' Maradona added prophetically, after watching a 17-year-old Rooney make his international debut at a Euro 2004 qualifier against Macedonia.\n\nRooney in turn idolised the World Cup winner, calling him 'the best' in a poignant tribute to him after his death in 2020.\n\n'Yeah, I've still got it at home,' Rooney said of the tie. 'It was a strange moment, but I was fuming after the game.\n\n'I had gone out fuming, had a few glasses of wine to drown my sorrows. (So) I got something good out of the night at least, I got Maradona's tie.'"

            "content": "Tom Brady is mocked for 'embarrassing' fawning over Gianni Infantino as sycophantic sports stars line up to praise FIFA president after hitting milestone\n\nFootball legends have been mocked for their 'sycophantic' praise of FIFA president Gianni Infantino 10 years on from his election.\n\nThrough their social media channels, FIFA posted fawning tributes to the controversial figurehead from some big names, including Tom Brady.\n\nThe Birmingham City co-owner and NFL icon said: 'I think Gianni is a man of the people and he's always out there celebrating the great parts of the sport. I think he's made great contributions to the world of football.'\n\nBrady's 'man of the people' line riled up a number of supporters, particularly in light of the exorbitant ticket prices at this year's World Cup.\n\nTickets to group games in next year's tournament hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico are three times more expensive than in the previous World Cup.\n\nThe cheapest seats at the final will cost £3,129 and there has been a huge backlash from fans - with Infantino insisting the prices simply reflect 'absolutely crazy' public demand.\n\nFIFA shared a number of tributes to Gianni Infantino, including one from NFL legend, Tom Brady\n\nBrady's praise led to one fan writing: 'That you had to make this montage of sycophancy then publicly post it, says more about Mr Infantino and the world's view of him than you appear to realise.'\n\nAnother posted: 'Tom Brady will literally shill for anyone at this point. Fanatics. Saudi flag football. FIFA. Doesn't matter.\n\n'Now he's calling Gianni Infantino a \"man of the people\" while World Cup tickets cost a mortgage payment and FIFA is wrapped in controversy.'\n\nThat was a sentiment also echoed by the comment: 'His \"man of the people\" Infantino has overseen a ticket price increase so drastic that most Americans won't be able to afford attending a World Cup in their own back yard. Literally would have been cheaper to go to the Euros, flights included.'\n\nOthers labelled the praise 'embarrassing' and a few claimed the FIFA president is worse than his disgraced predecessor, Sepp Blatter.\n\nThe love-in was not just limited to Brady. Francesco Totti was included in the compilation of praise, writing: 'He's an amazing person, a hard worker, someone who always wants to do his best for football. We're talking about a genuine competitive, well-rounded person, someone who is always available, always there for everyone.'\n\nLegendary Spanish defender Carlos Puyol added: 'I think he's doing a great job. He's trying to get football to grow.'\n\nAnd German World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus said: 'You can tell that he's very, very close to football, not only in his head but above all his heart. He's emotionally involved and it's wonderful, of course, that the president of a world association carries this sport in his heart like that.'\n\nInfantino, pictured this week during a trip to Colombia in a personalised hat, has been at the helm for a decade and FIFA's X account posted praise of their leader\n\nInfantino rarely misses an opportunity for self-promotion and the praise of his leadership was posted out to FIFA's 14.9 million followers on X.\n\nIt wasn't just former players gushing over the FIFA president. PSG head honcho Nasser Al-Khelaïfi wrote: 'Our FIFA Club World Cup, that's a huge success for me. Around $2billion in revenue in less than one year, so it was a big success for the clubs and for FIFA.'\n\nInfantino has been a divisive character during his decade in charge. He has been repeatedly criticised for his cozy relationship with US president Donald Trump, especially during the Club World Cup and World Cup draw, during which he awarded him a peace prize.\n\nThis week, Infantino batted down questions around Mexico's ability to co-host the World Cup this summer with cartel violence ripping through the country.\n\nChaos has engulfed Mexico in recent days after the army killed one of the world's most notorious drug lords, Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera Cervantes.\n\nThat sparked a wave of retaliation across the country and forced the country's football federation to postpone a number of games over recent days.\n\nMexico is slated to host 13 games across three cities - Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey - including the curtain raiser in Mexico City on June 11.\n\nFrancesco Totti was another 'FIFA legend' to share a tribute, calling him an 'amazing person'\n\nBut amid fears for fans' safety, Infantino insisted this week that FIFA is 'convinced everything will turn out for the best.'\n\n'I want to say from the outset that we have complete confidence in Mexico, in president [Claudia] Sheinbaum, in the authorities, and we are convinced that everything will turn out for the best.\n\n'From my side and from FIFA's side, I have absolute confidence in Sheinbaum.\n\n\n\n'We are in regular contact with the authorities, and we are, in any case, monitoring the situation. The World Cup is going to be an incredible celebration.'"

'What we couldn't have known then is just how far your joy, combined with your dedication and faith, could take you.\n\n'You have never forgotten your values, faith, or people who have supported you along the way. That means more to us than any goal, trophy, or contract ever could.\n\nBukayo Saka was left unable to speak as he read aloud a letter from his parents after signing a new Arsenal contract\n\n'Remember, success is not measured only in achievements, but in character. Keep smiling Bukayo, enjoy this journey. Keep believing and keep being the example you are to so many young people who look up to you.'\n\nAs he finished reading out the letter on CNN, who had presented it to him, Saka struggled to speak as he was left on the verge of tears.\n\n'Wow,' he managed. 'I don't see my mum and dad speak with me a lot like this.\n\n'I am pretty speechless. It's amazing. I don't know what to say apart from thank you to them. I wouldn't be here without them.\n\n'Their journey is, for me, inspiring. From being in Nigeria to where we are today as a family... the only explanation is God.\n\n'It is not normal. There is a one-in-a-million chance. I am so grateful and this is beautiful'.\n\nHaving won individual plaudits for both Arsenal and England performances, the missing piece in Saka's career to date is silverware.\n\nArteta's Gunners are hunting down a first Premier League title since his promising appointment in 2019, and currently sit four points clear of chasers Manchester City.\n\n\n\nThey also remain competitive in all four club competitions this season, with next month's Carabao Cup final against Man City the first opportunity to win a trophy."

            "content": "The release of the latest season of Netflix's Drive to Survive has revealed the poignant moment former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner broke the news of his sacking to his Spice Girl wife Geri Halliwell.\n\nThe long-serving team boss was deposed midway through the 2025 season amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor, one year on from his sex texting scandal which set the Formula One world alight.\n\nHorner eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package, but while his departure sent shockwaves through the motorsport community, behind-the-scenes insight has revealed that Halliwell had an ominous inkling that her husband's Red Bull days were numbered.\n\nFootage in the docu-series' Red Bull-centric episode showed Horner opening up to his wife at the table in their kitchen's conservatory, with the 52-year-old starting the conversation with a downbeat 'hey darling'.\n\n'All... all done and dusted,' Horner confirmed as he kissed Halliwell on the forehead, before sitting down at the table and accepting a waiting latte.\n\nHalliwell looked visibly emotional as Horner gave her the scant details of his meeting, before asking: 'How do you feel?'\n\nChristian Horner was consoled by his wife Geri Halliwell after his shock Red Bull sacking\n\nThe former Spice Girl looked visibly emotional as her husband recounted how the team swung the axe after 20 years\n\n'How do I feel?' Horner wondered aloud. 'Um... I never imagined to be in this position.\n\n'Of course your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s*** sandwich like that is, like, f*** them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\n\n'But you thought it was going to happen. We came back from that Austria race and I remember you sat on the bed one night and went \"Something really bad's gonna happen\".'\n\nHalliwell confirmed that she had said that they were going to 'fire' her husband.\n\nScenes from the episode later showed Halliwell and Horner watching a race on television - a hitherto unusual way of experiencing raceday for the former team principal, who had held his role since 2005.\n\n'You haven't got any of the data here really!' Horner complained. 'Well, normally I would have a whole bunch of noise in my ears. So it's like you're blind.'\n\nHalliwell admitted that she now felt 'a bit sad watching this' as her eyes filled with tears.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekend alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at the start and end of the season as well as at proximate races such as the British Grand Prix.\n\nLater in the episode the couple took the unusual decision to watch a race from their home\n\nThe moment was captured at Horner's luxurious mansion in Oxfordshire by Netflix's cameras\n\nHalliwell and Horner were frequent fixtures in the paddock throughout their relationship\n\nWhen in February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner, Halliwell flew to Bahrain to take her husband's side.\n\nHorner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nBack at their Cotswolds home, Halliwell tried to lift the mood by suggesting that Horner might be trying to 'eat his feelings'.\n\nIn improved spirits, the pair later horsed around by their swimming pool, with Horner pretending to be on the brink of throwing Halliwell in, before she admonished him, saying: 'You're such a t**t.'\n\nThe episode also saw Horner explain who he believes is responsible for his sacking, after speculation at the time suggested that star driver Max Verstappen and his father Jos may have played their roles.\n\n'His father has never been my biggest fan,' Horner admitted when asked if it had been the Verstappens who wielded the axe. 'He's been outspoken about me.\n\n'But I don't believe the Verstappens were responsible in any way. I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut (Marko) advising from the sideline.\n\n'Ultimately things changed within the business, the group, the founder died and after Dietrich [Mateschitz's] death I was probably deemed to have too much control.'\n\nIn the months since his sacking, Horner has eyed a return to the sport, sharing last week that he felt he had 'unfinished business in the sport' amid swirling links to rival constructors including Aston Martin.\n\n'But I am not going to come back for just anything,' Horner clarified at the European Motorshow in Dublin. 'I am only going to come back for something that can win.\n\n'I don't want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built.'"

The Reds are currently sixth.\n\nMatchday revenue rose by £14m to £116m in the first full season with the new Anfield Road Stand in operation, while commercial revenue went up by £15m to £323m in a year full of new partnerships signed with the likes of Japan Airlines and Lucozade.\n\nLiverpool's financial results highlight the cost of failing to qualify for the Champions League\n\nNon-football events at Anfield such as P!NK and Taylor Swift performing at the stadium also were big earners. Another concert, Billy Joel, was postponed and subsequently cancelled due to the Piano Man’s health concerns.\n\nThere were some unwanted increases in the accounts, notably administrative costs going up by £57m to £657m, mainly due to higher staffing costs.\n\nJenny Beacham, the club’s chief financial officer, said: ‘We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it.\n\n‘The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title. The challenge for us is to continue with our growth, through the incredible work that we do in areas such as our partnership portfolio and retail offerings, as well as continuing to diversify our focus to best serve our global fanbase.’"

No changes were made and they played on in black.\n\n\n\nWhen the match eventually began, the 12,500 fans in Estadio Juan Ramón Loubriel were rewarded by a Messi penalty in a 2-1 victory for Javier Mascherano's side in one of the more eventful friendly games in recent memory."

He's actually smiling about it. We're not going to show you it because it can put you off your tea.'\n\nForest's fans were impressed by their skipper's determination, with one writing on X: 'Ryan Yates is rock 'ard isn't he?'\n\n'Hard as nails. Proper footballer. My captain,' another said.\n\n'I would have had a week off work,' one quipped.\n\nIt wasn't even the worst viewing for Forest fans on the night.\n\nThe East Midlands club thrashed Fenerbahce 3-0 in the away leg last week in Vitor Pereira's first game in charge.\n\nBut the Turkish club came to England with a vengeance, taking a 1-0 lead after 22 minutes thanks to Kerem Akturkoglu.\n\nAnd Akturkoglu doubled Fenerbahce's lead from the penalty spot early in the second half after Jair Cunha's foul, which many felt had been cheaply given.\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi halved the deficit and gave Forest breathing room in the tie after 68 minutes with a superb bottom-corner finish.\n\n\n\nFrom there, Pereira's side hung on to win the tie 4-2 on aggregate, despite being spooked and losing 2-1 on the night."

However, you would struggle to match those wins against a weight-drained opponent with the rewards on offer in a deal that has rocked the sport and caused a rift with his former promoter Eddie Hearn at Matchroom.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs many do, I feel for Hearn. Boxing is a hard business. You can understand how he feels after supporting Benn during the controversies surrounding his two failed drug tests, and providing the platform and backing for him to relaunch his career.\n\nDenzel Bentley calls for Janibek Alimkhanuly to be stripped of world title READ MORE :\n\nConor Benn announces next fight after splitting from Eddie Hearn READ MORE :\n\nThe money is coming from Saudi Arabia, of course, in the shape of Turki Alalsheikh, the joint owner of Zuffa and chairman of the Saudi government department, the General Entertainment Authority.\n\nZuffa have immediately pitched Benn against Regais Prograis on the Tyson Fury card at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April. The fight is at a catchweight 150 pounds, three pounds above the welterweight limit he is targeting for a world title shot. The division is full of sparkle. Ryan Garcia, who beat Mario Barrios for the WBC crown last week, is Benn’s big target. Devin Haney has re-established himself as another box-office option.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPrograis is not in their class. Josh Taylor beat him up at super lightweight when he was in his prime. At 37, he has not been paired with Benn to win.\n\nView 2 Images Benn's decision to leave Eddie Hearn and Matchroom has sent shockwaves through the industry (Image: Getty Images)\n\nPrograis will stand and fight, and Benn will get him out of there, so it will look good. But the evidence that he can go higher has yet to be established. That said, there is every chance he can win a title but it’s still a hell of a gamble by Zuffa.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBenn is certainly an exciting fighter. He believes in himself absolutely and leaves it all on the pitch. But that does not make him a world champion.\n\nPerhaps that doesn’t matter in an age when Anthony Joshua can make record money fighting Jake Paul. Zuffa will have seen that and are banking on Benn’s capacity to drive eyeballs and thus dollars.\n\nAnd if they can put Benn in a ring with a Garcia or a Haney then there will be few complaints from boxing fans.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n**Follow Barry on X at @‌ClonesCyclone @mcguigan’s_Gym"

(0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

He's done a lot for Purdue University.\"\n\nBobby Hurley of Duke (1990-93) holds the D-I record with 1,076 assists. Smith entered averaging 8.7 assists per game. The Boilermakers have three games left before the Big Ten tournament.\n\nSmith surpassed Michigan State's Cassius Winston (2017-20) for the Big Ten career record earlier this season.\n\nThe 6-foot senior was a consensus first-team All-American last season and won the Bob Cousy Award for the top collegiate point guard."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nNeymar broke his 2026 goal drought in spectacular fashion Thursday, leading Santos to a 2-1 victory over Vasco da Gama in the fourth round of the Brasileirão.\n\nAfter the match, the former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain star addressed his critics and the mounting pressure regarding a potential return for Brazil at the upcoming men's World Cup.\n\n\"Last week they said I was the worst player in the world. Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process.\"\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\n\"The little dance [I did] was for Vinicius Jr.,\" Neymar said.\n\n\"I told him, when he scored his first goal in Portugal, they insulted him, were racist towards him and everything else, I told him 'you score a goal and do the same celebration, if I score a goal, I'll do the same'. Vini, it's for you.\"\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes. The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough. He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

Of those, 12 places are reserved for UEFA qualifying group winners, with the other four coming via the play-offs.\n\nThe 12 group runners-up will be joined by four teams who finished outside the top two of their respective qualifying groups, who were the 'best performers' in the 2024/25 Nations League.\n\nImage: Troy Parrott's stunning hat-trick against Hungary saw the Republic of Ireland secure a shock play-off spot\n\nHere are the final standings from each of the 12 groups:\n\nGroup A: Germany qualified, Slovakia and Northern Ireland into play-offs\n\nGermany qualified, and into play-offs Group B: Switzerland qualified, Kosovo and Sweden into play-offs\n\nSwitzerland qualified, and into play-offs Group C: Scotland qualified, Denmark into play-offs\n\nScotland qualified, into play-offs Group D: France qualified, Ukraine into play-offs\n\nFrance qualified, into play-offs Group E: Spain qualified, Turkey into play-offs\n\nSpain qualified, into play-offs Group F: Portugal qualified, Republic of Ireland into play-offs\n\nPortugal qualified, into play-offs Group G: Netherlands qualified, Poland into play-offs\n\nNetherlands qualified, into play-offs Group H: Austria qualified, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Romania into play-offs\n\nAustria qualified, and into play-offs Group I: Norway qualified, Italy into play-offs\n\nNorway qualified, into play-offs Group J: Belgium qualified, Wales and North Macedonia into play-offs\n\nBelgium qualified, and into play-offs Group K: England qualified, Albania into play-offs\n\nEngland qualified, into play-offs Group L: Croatia qualified, Czech Republic into play-offs\n\nCould every home nation be at the World Cup?\n\nNo!

More often than not, this means the four additional play-off spots are filled by four of the 14 Nations League group winners.\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:"

            "content": "Savage 4 has released “Rhythm & Ghrime” featuring UK grime artiste Novelist and global music executive Smallgod, marking what is being described as a defining moment for Ghana Grime, also known as GHRIME.\n\nThe high-energy collaboration serves as the second release from the GHRIME Riddims series under the broader Grime Frequency project, a body of work created over seven intensive days in Accra during the festive season.\n\nProduced by Novelist and executive-produced by Smallgod, “Rhythm & Ghrime” fuses Ghanaian street cadence with a UK grime foundation. The track draws inspiration from the iconic “Rhythm & Gash”, one of the most influential instrumentals in UK grime history, previously championed by pioneers such as Skepta, Jme and Central Cee.\n\nBy reinterpreting the energy of that classic and infusing it with Ghanaian grit, Savage 4 seeks to establish the sonic DNA of GHRIME, a hybrid sound blending Ghanaian rhythm, drill intensity and grime’s raw tempo. The result is an anthem that connects Accra and London while introducing a new wave to global audiences.\n\nAs the second instalment of the Ghrime Frequency rollout, “Rhythm & Ghrime” sets the tone for a structured series of releases aimed at defining, documenting and exporting GHRIME as a distinct genre and cultural movement rooted in Ghana, with global ambition.\n\n“Rhythm & Ghrime” is now available on all major streaming platforms.

            "content": "The Minister for Transport, Joseph Bukari Nikpe, has inaugurated a new Board of Directors for the Tema Shipyard and Drydock, charging members to spearhead a bold transformation of the strategic maritime asset and position Ghana as a leading maritime hub in West Africa.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony on February 27, 2026, the Minister described the reconstitution of the Board as a pivotal step in government’s broader Reset Agenda under President John Dramani Mahama, aimed at restoring sustained socio economic growth and strengthening key national institutions.\n\nHe noted that Ghana’s ports and associated infrastructure remain central to boosting trade, economic expansion and gross domestic product growth, particularly within the framework of the government’s 24 Hour Economy policy.\n\n“The Tema Shipyard and Drydock is not just a facility but a strategic national asset established by our first President, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah,” the Minister said. “For Ghana to harness the full potential of our Blue Economy resources, our maritime infrastructure must be world class, efficient and commercially viable.”\n\nThe Minister underscored government’s priority to retool and revamp the shipyard through private sector partnerships, modernisation of infrastructure and the injection of technical expertise. He stressed the facility’s potential to create jobs for Ghana’s youth and deepen local participation in the maritime value chain.\n\nHe further revealed plans to collaborate with the private sector to establish technical schools focused on shipbuilding and repair, in order to equip Ghanaians with industry specific skills. The shipyard, he added, could also provide fabrication, repair and engineering services to Ghana’s oil and gas sector.\n\nThe Minister urged the new Board to modernise infrastructure, explore Public Private Partnerships, ensure transparency and accountability, and address bottlenecks that have hindered the facility’s global competitiveness. He cautioned the Board against interfering in the day to day management of the company, reminding members to operate within established governance frameworks under the supervision of the Ministry.\n\nThe newly inaugurated Board is chaired by Dr. George Sipa Adjah Yankey, with members including Alhaji Osman Sulemana, Millicent Wutsika, Mahama Adam Jandah, Samuel Bavug Wusah, Kofi A. Asmah, Abubakari Muaz Zemoli, Obed Koah Opintan and Albert Derrick Fiatui.\n\nResponding on behalf of the Board, Chairman Dr. Yankey expressed appreciation to the President and the Minister for the confidence reposed in them.\n\n“We shall work assiduously with Management and Staff to move the Tema Drydock and Shipbuilding Company to the next level,” he said. “By the end of our term, we expect the company to be not only the envy of West Africa, but an active and competitive player in the drydock and shipbuilding industry in Africa.”\n\nDr. Yankey pledged the Board’s commitment to supporting government’s Reset Agenda and the 24 Hour Economy programme, describing the shipyard as a potential linchpin of round the clock industrial activity. He noted that the company has already commenced a three shift system and assured that the Board would ensure it remains productive and sustainable.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that significant retooling is required, including the acquisition of critical equipment such as Computer Numerical Control machines, cranes and winches. Skills upgrading, he added, would also be necessary to meet evolving industry demands.\n\nAs Ghana seeks to deepen its Blue Economy potential and expand industrial capacity, the revitalisation of the Tema Shipyard and Drydock is expected to play a central role in job creation, maritime competitiveness and broader economic transformation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

I am being subjected to injustice, abuse and ingratitude.\" He can appeal against both the conviction and the sentence.\n\nFollowing the 2011 revolution, hundreds of Tunisians travelled to Syria, Iraq, and Libya to join or fight alongside Islamic State groups. Ennahda faced strong criticism from its secular rivals for allegedly facilitating their travel during its time in power, an accusation it has always strongly denied.\n\nThe case involving Larayedh included seven other defendants, among them former officials from the Interior Ministry.\n\nTAP state news agency quoted a judicial official as saying that their sentences ranged from three years to 24 years.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Organisers say the summit, held to mark International Women’s Day, promises to be the most impactful edition yet.\n\nTheme 2026: “Give to Gain”\n\nUnder this year’s theme, “Give to Gain,” NWSE 2026 seeks to challenge conventional thinking about success. It highlights the idea that when women give through mentorship, collaboration, investment, knowledge-sharing and opening doors, entire ecosystems benefit.\n\nThe theme aligns with global International Women’s Day momentum and calls on women across generations to move beyond individual advancement towards collective elevation. The summit will spotlight how strategic generosity, intentional networks and shared opportunities can drive growth in business, leadership, finance, governance and entrepreneurship.\n\nA platform shaping national conversations\n\nOver the past seven editions, the National Women’s Summit & Expo has evolved into one of Ghana’s leading platforms dedicated to advancing women’s leadership, economic empowerment, mentorship and cross-generational dialogue.\n\nOrganisers describe NWSE as more than a conference, but:\n\n• A national convening of influence\n\n• A high-impact business and leadership ecosystem\n\n• A mentorship bridge between established leaders and emerging talent\n\n• A marketplace of ideas, capital and opportunity\n\nFrom corporate executives and decision-makers to founders, creatives, students and young entrepreneurs, the summit attracts a diverse and influential audience.\n\nWhat to expect at NWSE 2026\n\nParticipants can look forward to a full day of transformational keynote addresses, panel discussions on leadership, access to finance, entrepreneurship and power, networking sessions, and an immersive and interactive expo connecting brands directly with a premium female audience. The event will also feature speed mentorship sessions.\n\nThe 2026 edition will place special emphasis on mentorship, access to capital, intergenerational collaboration and rethinking financial systems for equity, positioning women as key architects of economic growth.\n\nStrategic partnerships driving impact\n\nThe summit is supported by corporate institutions including:\n\n• Bayport Management Ltd\n\n• Standard Chartered\n\n• Bel-Aqua Mineral Water\n\nOrganisers say these partnerships reinforce the summit’s position as a serious economic and leadership platform.\n\nCall for Expo vendors\n\nOrganisers have opened applications for Expo vendors, inviting SMEs, startups, founders and established brands to secure exhibition spaces.\n\nThey say the Expo offers opportunities to engage directly with decision-makers, build strategic partnerships, boost brand visibility and convert inspiration into measurable business outcomes. Exhibition spaces are limited and will be allocated on a first-confirmed basis.\n\nWhy NWSE 2026 matters\n\nThe summit brings together women who are shaping industries and driving change. According to organisers, it is a space where partnerships are formed, investments are sparked and mentorship changes trajectories.\n\nRegistration is now open. For vendor participation, partnerships or media enquiries, the public can call 020 471 4598 or 024 646 9062.\n\nThe National Women’s Summit & Expo is held annually to mark International Women’s Day. Now in its eighth year, it continues to serve as a catalyst for dialogue, insight and economic empowerment for women in Ghana and beyond.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Multimedia Group Limited, through its radio brand Joy FM, in collaboration with Safari Eco Park, has launched the School Kids Project aimed at allowing students across the country to experience nature, wildlife, and outdoor learning.\n\nThe initiative was announced by the General Manager for Sales and Marketing at Multimedia Ghana, Max Fugar, during an interview on the Joy FM Super Morning Show on February 27.\n\nAccording to Mr Fugar, the campaign is designed to ensure that these enriching experiences are accessible to schoolchildren from across the country.\n\nUnder the project, Max Fugar explained that primary school pupils would pay 100 cedis, while tertiary students would be charged 150 cedis to take part in the Safari Eco Park experience.\n\n“What do they get for this? They get to, first on arrival, you see a new ecopark office, which was never here. And then you get into the orientation room, where you are given a general overview of what to expect whilst here,” he explained.\n\nVisitors are then taken through an art gallery featuring African cultural artifacts. “Then you come into an art gallery where different sorts of artifacts from across Africa have been beautifully curated.”\n\nAccording to him, Park 1 offers relaxation and interactive experiences. “You then enter the first park, Park 1. Now you are welcomed into park 1, with benches scattered throughout. So you can actually take a bit of time, chill, and picnic.”\n\nHe added, “We have the diners, which actually have snacks. So you can get your snacks, sit around, and listen to quiet music. And from there, you can visit an ant cave, which is again created by the team here. There's steam, there's the sound of thunder, and there's lightning in there.”\n\nDescribing Park 2, Max Fugar said it features a cafeteria area selling snacks, as well as table games and target games. He added that visitors can also interact with animals such as alpacas and dwarf horses, which may be fed directly from their hands.\n\nPark 3 showcases larger wildlife species. “Another canopy walk takes you into park 3, where you see the bigger animals. You see the zebras, the wildebeest, the nyalas, the impalas, and others.”\n\nHe noted that visitors can relax after completing the tour. “When you are done with all this, you can either decide to actually chill out in the parks without moving, where you can snack, listen to music, and enjoy your time with us. These are the three parks that we have at the moment.”\n\nMr Fugar stressed that the experience is designed to be interactive and educational. “We say to every single person that comes through, 'This is not like watching movies. This is for you to immerse yourself in nature, where you make movies out of your own self.”\n\nHe clarified that the programme is specifically targeted at organised student groups. “It's for students, basically for students. This is to enable as many students as possible to be able to come through our doors.”\n\nTouching on expansion plans, Max Fugar explained that Park 4 is located at Aqua Safari. He said the Eco Park currently has five parks, with parks 1, 2, and 3 at the main site, while parks 4 and 5—and a sixth park coming soon are at Aqua Safari.\n\nThe School Kids Project forms part of efforts by Joy FM and Safari Eco Park to promote environmental education and experiential learning among students through structured outdoor activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Extracts from neem plants can be used as pesticides that control many of the pests that may damage our crops, especially vegetables,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe lecturer added that rabbit urine is also an effective natural pesticide and encouraged rabbit farmers to collect and store the urine for agricultural use.\n\n“These are organic substances coming from living organisms, so they don’t persist in the environment for a long time, which is why they are very good compared to synthetic chemicals, which can stay in the environment for years, pass through the food chain, and reach the human body system,” he explained.\n\n\n\nHe added that farmers may apply the rabbit urine directly to crops or mix it with garlic and pepper to make it more potent against pests.\n\n\n\nAuto dealers respond to 15% price cut announcement"

Atlas has warehouses at cocoa-growing areas in the Ashanti, Eastern, Western, and Central regions,” the statement said.\n\n\n\nThe clarification follows comments made by Assafuah at a press conference on 23 February, where he suggested that Atlas may be operating from facilities belonging to the state-owned Produce Buying Company (PBC), in breach of regulations.\n\n\n\nThe MP also raised concerns over possible conflicts of interest involving Atlas and officials of the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD), arguing that some private firms may be benefiting from access to state infrastructure.\n\n\n\nHe cited the Regulations and Guidelines for the Internal Marketing of Cocoa, 2015, which require Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs) to operate only in warehouses registered in their own names.\n\n“Warehouses registered under PBC must not be used by another company for storage, grading, sealing, or processing of cocoa,” he stated.\n\n\n\nAtlas, however, maintained that it has operated rented and registered depots in multiple districts since commencing operations in 2018. Its facilities span several communities in the Ashanti, Eastern, Central, and Western South regions, including Effiduase, Kade, Nyakrom, Tarkwa, and Bogoso.\n\n\n\nThe company added that these arrangements are supported by tenancy agreements and are verifiable through records held by the Quality Control Company and COCOBOD.\n\n\n\nAtlas also holds sustainability certifications under the Rainforest Alliance programme, which it said reflects compliance with industry standards.\n\n\n\nThe company acknowledged that it temporarily used a PBC depot in Hohoe in December 2025 but described the move as an isolated, district-level arrangement.\n\nThe facility was made available by the local PBC District Manager while Atlas was setting up operations in the Volta Region to prevent cocoa from being smuggled out of the country.\n\n\n\n“Access to the PBC facilities was granted at the district level within the context of established operational relationships,” the statement noted, adding that borrowed jute sacks had since been replaced.\n\n\n\nWhile Atlas insists it operates independently and in accordance with regulatory requirements, Assafuah maintains that questions remain regarding access to infrastructure and compliance with cocoa marketing rules."

How do you build a nation out of this diversity?”\n\n\n\nAccording to Pratt, this was the core challenge confronting leaders at independence, how to unite dozens of ethnic groups under one national identity.\n\n\n\nHe argued that conversations around political structures at the time were driven by the desire to forge unity, not by personal ambition.\n\n\n\n“At a certain point there was thought about how to evolve a structure that brought everybody on board,” he explained, suggesting that the push for broad-based governance was seen as a practical response to fragmentation.\n\n\n\nPratt also drew parallels with modern political debates. He pointed to ongoing calls for a single national development plan that all governments would be compelled to follow.\n\n\n\n“What are they telling us?” he asked. “If you say every government must follow one development plan, then you are arguing for one orientation.”\n\n\n\nIn his view, critics who condemn past political models while advocating uniform national planning today should reflect more carefully on the implications of their own arguments."

Asmah, Abubakari Muaz Zemoli, Obed Koah Opintan, and Albert Derrick Fiatui.\n\n\n\nNikpe cautioned the board against taking over day-to-day management, stressing that they are to work collaboratively with management under good governance principles.\n\n\n\n“Permit me to caution the Board from either covertly or overtly taking over the day-to-day management of the Shipyard, but work as a team with management in line with good governance principles,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe government has pledged to provide policy guidance and support to ensure the shipyard thrives, underscoring that the board’s success would reflect national progress.\n\n\n\n“We will work hand-in-hand with you to remove any bureaucratic hurdles and attract the right investments for the shipyard,” Nikpe added.\n\nThe inauguration of the TSY Board is part of the government’s broader agenda to develop maritime infrastructure, create employment opportunities, and establish Ghana as a transport and logistics hub in the West African sub-region."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "A United Nations investigative body has warned that South Sudan risks “a return to full-scale war” unless it can urgently put an end to entrenched impunity and widespread abuses amid escalating violence in the world’s youngest country.\n\nThe report by the UN’s Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS), released on Friday at the Human Rights Council session in Geneva, found that civilians were enduring severe abuses including killings and “systematic” sexual violence, arbitrary detention, forced displacement and deprivation amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in one of the world’s most impoverished countries.\n\nIt said “escalating atrocity risks” and the collapse of political safeguards in the country made “urgent preventive action imperative”, calling on regional and international actors to engage with diplomatic pressure, sanctions and enforcing the UN arms embargo until concrete improvements in human rights and accountability are achieved.\n\n“Preventing further mass atrocity crimes, institutional collapse, and the destruction of South Sudan’s fragile transition requires urgent coordinated national, regional and international re-engagement,” the report said.\n\nThe report, drawing on a year of investigations and testimony, blamed the actions of political and military elites – in detaining opposition leaders, eroding power sharing and attempting to change the terms of a 2018 peace agreement – for placing a peace framework in the country under major strain and increasing instability.\n\n\n\nIt noted that the arrest and removal from office of First Vice President Riek Machar last year, and his prosecution for murder, treason and crimes against humanity, had undermined “the core power-sharing guarantees” of the peace agreement, and triggered “political uncertainty and armed clashes on a scale not witnessed” for a decade.\n\nMachar, an ethnic Nuer, was suspended last year as South Sudan’s number two after opposition Nuer White Army fighters overran a military garrison in the town of Nasir.\n\nCivil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, when President Salva Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, the country’s largest, first dismissed Machar as vice president, accusing him of plotting a coup.\n\nThe report also noted that intensifying military operations had been marked by a “dangerous shift in tactics”, including air strikes on civilian-populated areas.\n\nIt said that the deployment of forces from neighbouring Uganda, a guarantor of the 2018 peace agreement, had “materially strengthened” government forces militarily and “raised credible concerns” of violations of a UN arms embargo.\n\nThe CHRSS report noted that joint aerial bombardments by the Ugandan and South Sudan armies had targeted civilian areas, “predominantly affecting [ethnic] Nuer communities in opposition-affiliated areas”.\n\nSexual violence ‘widespread, systematic’\n\nConflict-related sexual violence remained a “defining and persistent feature” of the crisis, the report found, with survivor testimonies over the past decade showing “widespread and systematic patterns of rape and other forms of sexual violence perpetrated by all armed forces and groups”.\n\nMost women and girls lived “at constant risk of sexual violence,” it said, adding that last year, the threat of such abuse had again “functioned as a strategic instrument of conflict deployed to terrorise civilian populations, drive displacement, and fracture social cohesion”.\n\nThe report said that impunity was entrenched, with senior commanders and political actors rarely held accountable for serious abuses perpetrated on their behalf.\n\nThe report also noted a sharp deterioration in civic space, with journalists, activists and opposition figures facing harassment, surveillance and arbitrary detention, undermining prospects for inclusive political participation and long-term stability.\n\nThe commission urged the government to immediately halt violations by its forces, release those arbitrarily detained and guarantee freedoms of expression, assembly and association.\n\n\n\nIt also called for the urgent establishment of long-delayed transitional justice mechanisms to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed since 2013.\n\nRenewed conflict\n\nAn estimated 400,000 people were killed in the five years of a war waged largely along ethnic lines, before calm was restored with a peace deal in 2018.\n\nBut escalating fighting in recent months has brought renewed fears of a return to civil war.\n\nBeginning in December, a coalition of opposition forces – some loyal to Machar, leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM/IO) – seized a string of government outposts in Jonglei state, an opposition stronghold northeast of the capital, Juba that is the homeland of the Nuer ethnic group.\n\nFollowing the territorial losses, South Sudan’s army announced a major military operation against opposition forces in late January, ordering civilians and aid groups to leave areas of Jonglei state, a move that the International Crisis Group said showed the country had “returned to war”.\n\nMillions affected\n\nThe United Nations said earlier this month that an estimated 280,000 people have been displaced by the fighting and air attacks since late December, including more than 235,000 across Jonglei alone, while UNICEF warned last week that more than 450,000 children are at risk of acute malnutrition due to mass displacement and the halting of critical medical services in Jonglei.\n\nNearly 10 million people need life-saving humanitarian assistance across South Sudan, while humanitarian operations have been crippled by attacks and looting, with observers saying both sides in the conflict have prevented assistance from reaching areas where they believe civilians support their opponents.\n\nThe CHRSS report said that civilians had borne the “overwhelming human brunt” of the crisis as conflict, violence, displacement and sexual violence had intensified “an already-dire humanitarian situation”.\n\nLast year, it said, displacement had risen by nearly 40 percent to 3.2 million people, while declining international assistance was disproportionately affecting women and children."

            "content": "Win would provisionally take Barcelona four points ahead of Real Madrid, who host Getafe on Monday night.\n\nWho: Barcelona vs Villarreal\n\nWhat: La Liga\n\nWhere: Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain\n\nWhen: Saturday, February 28 at 4:15pm (15:15 GMT)\n\nHow to follow: We’ll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 12:30 GMT in advance of our live text commentary stream.\n\nBarca welcome high-flying Villarreal to Camp Nou, with the hosts looking to tighten their grip on pole position in La Liga.\n\nA win would provisionally take Barcelona four points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, who host mid-table Getafe on Monday night.\n\nBarcelona had a mini-wobble earlier this month as they were thrashed 4-0 by Atletico Madrid in the first-leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal before losing 2-1 to Girona, allowing Madrid to briefly occupy top spot.\n\nHowever, Barca bounced back with a 3-0 win over Levante last weekend to steady the ship, while Madrid slipped to a surprise defeat at Osasuna.\n\nThird-placed Villarreal trail Barcelona by 10 points, and their hopes of competing for the title could be rekindled with a surprise victory at Camp Nou.\n\nThe visitors come into the game high on confidence after beating Valencia 2-1 in their last outing and winning three of their last four La Liga matches.\n\nVillarreal have also won their last two away games against Barcelona, so they will have little fear heading into this showdown.\n\nBarca strikers firing blanks as Villarreal visit\n\nBarcelona host Villarreal amid concerns about the form of strikers Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich great Lewandowski, 37, has declined rapidly this season as well as enduring some fitness issues, while Torres, 25, is on course for a personal record for goals, but most of them came in a purple patch towards the end of last year.\n\n\n\nThe Catalan giants have obvious problems in defence, as opponents exploit their high line with growing regularity, but last season managed to score enough goals to outweigh their deficiencies in that area as they lifted a domestic treble.\n\nBarca still lead La Liga for goals scored this season, with 67, but they are coming from everywhere – 10 different players have scored two or more, and nobody has more than Torres on 12.\n\nBut Torres has just three goals in his last 15 appearances across all competitions, and his all-round game is lacking, unable to contribute effectively as Barca build up attacks, frequently losing the ball.\n\nLewandowski has five goals in his last 18 games, but seems less mobile than before and a peripheral presence at times.\n\n“With so many matches rotation at striker is natural, and I think Ferran and I can benefit from the current situation,” Lewandowski told Polish magazine Pilka Nozna this week.\n\n“When you play 90 minutes every three days, your whole life is about recovery, now the balance is a little better. I’m tired but I’m not worn out.”\n\nFlick considers deploying Rashford as a striker\n\nBarcelona coach Hansi Flick has not used England international Marcus Rashford much in that position, with the Manchester United loanee more keen on operating from the left.\n\nHowever, with Raphinha fit and firing after an injury absence, Rashford might now view playing as a number nine as his best chance of more minutes.\n\nRashford has been effective for Barca this season, albeit as much in providing assists rather than scoring, laying on 13 goals for his teammates while netting 10 himself in 34 games across all competitions.\n\nWhile other sides took part in the Champions League playoff round, Flick hopes a relatively quiet couple of weeks for his side will have been of huge benefit.\n\n“It’s important that we [had] these two weeks to rest a little bit but also focus on the next match against Villarreal; that will also be a tough match,” said Flick.\n\n“After that, hopefully every three or four days we have a match, so it’s important to have these two weeks.”\n\n‘They’re a brave team that leaves spaces’\n\nVillarreal defender Santiago Mourino said his side were coming to Camp Nou for all three points and highlighted Barcelona’s high line as a weakness they would look to exploit.\n\n“We want to beat Barcelona and close the gap on them. It’s a difficult game. They’ve won all their home games,” Mourino said in a pre-match news conference.\n\n\n\n“Let’s see if we can end their winning streak. We have to play as equals.”\n\nHe added: “They’re a brave team that leaves spaces and we have to take advantage of those chances. We have great strikers and we need to be clinical to win.\n\n“We are one of the best teams in La Liga in open play and on the counterattack. If we are accurate, we can do well.”\n\nHead-to-head\n\nBarcelona and Villarreal have locked horns on 57 occasions. Barcelona won 35 of those games, Villarreal won 12, and 10 matches ended as draws.\n\nVillarreal have won their last two games away at Barca by scoring plenty of goals – recording a 3-2 victory in May 2025 and a 5-3 win in January 2024.\n\nWhat happened the last time these clubs met?\n\nBarcelona wingers Raphinha and Lamine Yamal guided the Catalan giants to a 2-0 win away at 10-man Villarreal in December 2025.\n\nBrazilian international Raphinha won and converted an early penalty before Villarreal’s Renato Veiga was sent off before half-time for a late lunge on Yamal.\n\nLamal slotted home Barca’s second midway through the second half.\n\nBarcelona team news\n\nBarca announced on Thursday that midfielder Frenkie de Jong will be out for up to six weeks with a hamstring issue. Centre-back Andreas Christensen has also been ruled out for a lengthy period with a similar injury.\n\nDefender Gerard Martin will be suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards.\n\nIn some positive news for Barca, midfielder Gavi has resumed training following a serious knee injury that has kept him out of action since August, but he is not expected to feature until sometime in March.\n\nPredicted starting XI:\n\nJoan Garcia (goalkeeper); Kounde, Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Balde; Bernal, Pedri; Yamal, Fermin, Raphinha; Lewandowski\n\nVillarreal’s team news\n\nPau Cabanes, Logan Costa, Juan Foyth, Willy Kambwala have all been ruled out with injuries, while Gerard Moreno and Pape Gueye face late fitness tests.\n\nPossible starting XI:\n\nLuiz Junior (goalkeeper); Mourino, Navarro, Veiga, Pedraza; Pepe, Comesana, Gueye, Moleiro; Mikautadze, Perez"

            "content": "Progressive Greens win closely watched election in one-time Labour stronghold, while right-wing Reform comes second.\n\nA candidate for the United Kingdom’s left-wing Green Party has comfortably won a closely-watched election for a vacant parliamentary seat, delivering an embarrassing defeat for Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party in one of its former strongholds.\n\nResults announced Friday showed the Greens’ Hannah Spencer, a 34-year-old councillor and plumber, had won 40.7 percent of the vote in the by-election in Gorton and Denton, a constituency in Greater Manchester that has been considered a secure Labour seat for almost a century.\n\nIn an outcome that analysts said pointed to the fracturing of the UK’s traditional two-party politics, the hard-right candidate for the populist, anti-immigration Reform finished in second place.\n\nLabour, which had won more than half the vote in Gorton and Denton at the last general election in 2024, finished a bruising third.\n\nThe Green Party has positioned itself as an alternative to Labour, arguing that the governing party has moved away from some of the values it once championed.\n\nThe Greens, and their party leader Zack Polanski, have been vocal in their condemnation of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and their support for Palestinians. Many Labour voters have been infuriated by the government’s ongoing diplomatic support for Israel through the carnage it has wrought in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.\n\nPolitical scientist John Curtice called the result a “seismic moment” that signalled that the “future of British politics looks more uncertain than at any stage” since the end of World War II, the Reuters news agency reported.\n\n\n\nThe result was “clearly disappointing”, said Labour Party chair Anna Turley.\n\nIn her victory speech, Spencer said she felt compelled to call out “politicians and divisive figures who constantly scapegoat and blame our communities for all the problems in society”.\n\nStarmer’s woes continue\n\nThe loss of what had been considered a safe seat, in the country’s biggest electoral test ⁠in nearly a year, adds to the mounting pressure on the embattled Starmer.\n\nThe British leader has faced calls for his resignation amid Labour’s nose-diving popularity and ongoing turmoil, including the arrest of Peter Mandelson, who Starmer had appointed ambassador to the US last year, following revelations surrounding his links to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nStarmer had personally invested political capital in the outcome by blocking Andy Burnham, the popular Manchester mayor who is widely touted as a potential challenger for the Labour leadership, from standing in the race, and by visiting the constituency before the vote.\n\nDuopoly challenged\n\nSpencer’s victory – the Greens’ first win in a by-election – gives the party its fifth seat in parliament, while the top-polling Reform, which is widely viewed as posing the biggest challenge to the government at the ballot box, has eight.\n\nBoth parties, along with the centrist Liberal Democrats, are polling in double digits, presenting a threat to the traditional Labour-Conservative duopoly in British politics.\n\nNigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigration Reform, claimed on X, without evidence, that the Greens’ win was “a victory for sectarian voting and cheating”, and welcomed forthcoming local elections in May.\n\n“It will be goodbye Starmer and goodbye to the Tory party,” he said.\n\nA Greens spokesperson dismissed Farage’s comments as “an attempt to undermine the democratic result” that was “straight out of the Trump playbook”.\n\nThe contest was triggered after former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne stood down for health reasons."

            "content": "Pakistani defence minister says Pakistan and Afghanistan are now at ‘open war’.\n\nPakistan has launched air strikes on Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, and other cities, as clashes escalate along the two countries’ shared border.\n\nOn Friday, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Islamabad’s patience had run out with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan, declaring that the two countries are now at “open war”.\n\nThe declaration came hours after Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah ⁠Mujahid said Afghanistan was carrying out “large-scale offensive operations” against the Pakistani military along the Durand Line, which separates the two countries.\n\nThis follows weeks of fighting along the countries’ shared border, with both sides claiming that dozens of people have been killed.\n\nHostilities are taking place against a backdrop of an escalation in tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities since the latter’s return to power in 2021.\n\nHere is what we know so far:\n\nWhat has happened?\n\nOn Friday, Pakistani officials said Afghan forces had attacked military positions close to the border, prompting Islamabad to launch air strikes on targets inside Afghanistan, including in the capital, Kabul, and in other cities.\n\nThe first Pakistani strike occurred at about 1:50am local time on Friday (21:20 GMT on Thursday), Al Jazeera’s correspondent Nasser Shadid reported, with Afghan forces responding with anti-aircraft fire.\n\n“Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on X.\n\nPakistan called this Operation Ghazab lil Haq, which translates to “righteous fury”.\n\nWhich areas in Afghanistan have been hit by Pakistan?\n\nPakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X that “Afghan Taliban defence targets” had been struck in Kabul, the southeastern Paktia province and southern Kandahar, while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif declared what he described as an “open war” with the Taliban government.\n\n\n\nAfghan government spokesperson Mujahid also confirmed in an X post that these three provinces had been hit.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that the attacks had destroyed two brigade bases in Afghanistan, citing two senior Pakistani security officials who spoke to the agency on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nPakistani state media outlet Pakistan TV claimed in a report that the country’s forces had “destroyed” a number of Taliban locations in a few hours.\n\nAccording to the outlet, the locations attacked in Afghanistan included a Taliban brigade headquarters and ammunition depot in Kandahar, as well as Taliban posts in the Wali Khan sector, near the Shawal sector, in the Bajaur sector and in Angoor Adda.\n\nPakistan’s Ministry of Information said it was also targeting Afghan Taliban forces in several districts of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province: Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur.\n\nLater on Friday, gunfire and shelling were reported near the key Torkham border crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nAl Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder, reporting from Islamabad, and the AFP news agency reported that shelling had been heard near the crossing in the morning.\n\nAFP reported Afghan soldiers were heading towards the frontier.\n\nThe Torkham crossing has remained open for Afghans returning en masse from Pakistan, despite the land border being largely shut since fighting between the neighbours in October.\n\nWhat do we know about casualties?\n\nReports from each side are conflicting.\n\nMosharraf Zaidi, the spokesperson for Pakistan’s prime minister, wrote on X early on Friday that in the attack on Friday morning, 133 Afghan Taliban forces had been killed and more than 200 were wounded.\n\nHe added that 27 Afghan Taliban posts had been destroyed, and nine had been captured. More than 80 “tanks, artillery pieces, and armed personnel carriers have been destroyed”, he wrote.\n\nPakistani news outlet Dawn reported that two Pakistani military personnel had died in the ongoing clashes.\n\nAl Jazeera could not independently verify the casualty figures released by Pakistan.\n\nThe Taliban government, however, said only eight Taliban fighters were killed and 11 were wounded.\n\nAfghanistan said its military had launched its attack on Pakistani military bases and outposts along the border early on Friday in retaliation against Pakistani strikes across the Afghan border on Sunday. It claimed its forces had killed 55 Pakistani soldiers, and captured two military bases and 19 military posts. Pakistan has dismissed this claim.\n\n\n\nFor its part, Pakistan said its air strikes last Sunday killed at least 70 “militants”, a claim dismissed by Mujahid, according to news outlets. Mujahid, instead, wrote on X that the attacks “killed and wounded dozens, including women and children”.\n\nThe provincial director of the Afghan Red Crescent Society in Nangarhar province, Mawlawi Fazl Rahman Fayyaz, said 18 people had been killed and several others were wounded on Sunday.\n\nFormer Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who does not hold an official position but remains an influential political figure, said the country “will defend their beloved homeland with complete unity in all circumstances and will respond to aggression with courage”.\n\n“Pakistan cannot free itself from the violence and bombings – those problems it has created itself – but must change its own policy and choose the path of good neighbourliness, respect, and civilised relations with Afghanistan,” he wrote in an X post on Friday.\n\nWhy are Pakistan and Afghanistan fighting?\n\nThe current flare-up of violence between the two countries is the culmination of months of tension.\n\nIn October 2025, Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed to an immediate ceasefire during talks mediated by Qatar and Turkiye following a week of fierce and deadly clashes along their border.\n\nThe border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is called the Durand Line and spans 2,611km (1,622 miles). Afghanistan does not formally recognise this border, which it argues was an imposed colonial demarcation that illegitimately divided ethnic Pashtun areas between the two countries.\n\nThe neighbours have been embroiled in frequent clashes since the Taliban took over in 2021. Sami Omari, an expert in South and Central Asian security and strategic affairs, told Al Jazeera there have been 75 clashes between Afghan and Pakistani forces since 2021 – the same year that US and NATO forces withdrew from Afghanistan.\n\nIn particular, Pakistan wants the Taliban to rein in armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban, known by its acronym TTP, which it says Afghanistan is harbouring. The TTP emerged in Pakistan in 2007 and is separate from the Taliban in Afghanistan, but shares deep ideological, social and linguistic ties with the group.\n\nArmed attacks in Pakistan by the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which operates in the resource-rich Balochistan province, have surged in recent years. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which border Afghanistan, have borne the brunt of the violence.\n\nOn Friday, Pakistan’s former Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said the country has “nothing against the proud and poor citizens of Afghanistan”.\n\n“But it is the Taliban (Afghanistan & Pakistan) who have forced Pakistan into this conflict,” he wrote on X.\n\n“For the sake of innocent civilians on both sides of the border, I hope the Taliban stop with incursions into and terrorism in Pakistan.”\n\nAfghanistan is unlikely to take action against armed groups, however, analysts say. “The Afghan Taliban appear unwilling to seriously crack down on the TTP, partly due to prior affinities between the two groups but also out of fear of TTP militants defecting to its main rival, the Islamic State Khorasan Province,” Pearl Pandya, South Asia senior analyst at the US-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), an independent, impartial conflict monitor, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\nPandya added that a serious escalation is “inevitable” if the Taliban in Afghanistan do not crack down on the TTP.\n\nElizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia programme at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington, DC, told Al Jazeera that the latest clashes are not surprising, as they stem from months of “frayed” tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n“It is significant to the extent that it represents perhaps a shift in strategy,” Threlkeld said, noting the “more aggressive, kinetic attacks” from Pakistan.\n\n“But since then, we’ve seen a couple of terrorist attacks within Pakistan that were quite significant. So, no, I’m not surprised that after those cumulative attacks, that tensions have frayed and things have again gone in this direction, unfortunately.”\n\nArmed warfare between the two nations would not favour Afghanistan, which is ill-equipped to meet Pakistan head on.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban does not have a military that is comparable to Pakistan’s, which is why it is using unconventional methods of attack, Abdul Basit, a scholar at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“They have suicide bombers and kamikaze drones, which I think they will use those in large numbers,” Basit said.\n\nFurthermore, Al Jazeera’s Kamal Hyder reported, “the Afghans do not have an air force, so the Pakistanis have the upper hand in striking across the border. They’ve attacked Kabul, Kandahar and other places. They say their main targets are ammunition depots and military infrastructure.”\n\n“Does it mean that Pakistani troops are going to cross the border?” he said. “It is very unlikely. However, we cannot rule out continuous exchange of fire across the border, with both sides using heavy artillery.”\n\nHow has the world reacted?\n\n“India strongly condemns Pakistan’s air strikes on Afghan territory that have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, during the holy month of Ramadan,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said.\n\n“It is another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures,” he said.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has urged both sides to adhere to international law, according to a statement delivered by his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has urged Afghanistan and Pakistan to resolve their differences through dialogue and good neighbourly principles.\n\n“In the blessed month of Ramadan, the month of self-restraint and strengthening solidarity in the world of Islam, it is fitting that Afghanistan and Pakistan manage and resolve their existing differences within the framework of good neighborliness and through the path of dialogue,” Araghchi wrote in an X post.\n\nRussia has urged the warring parties to ⁠halt cross-border attacks ‌immediately and resolve their differences through diplomatic ⁠means, the ⁠RIA news ⁠agency reported on ⁠Friday, ⁠citing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Russia has also offered to mediate."

            "content": "Warning: This story contains details about suicide that some readers may find disturbing. If you or a loved one is experiencing suicidal thoughts, help and support are available.\n\nLondon, United Kingdom – Before Charlotte Head was arrested, she was a charity worker supporting victims of domestic violence. She had also volunteered at refugee camps in Calais.\n\n“Such a terrorist,” she says, tongue in cheek, speaking to Al Jazeera in London.\n\nHead, 29, is part of the so-called “Filton 24”, two dozen pro-Palestine activists alleged to have raided the Bristol branch of Elbit Systems UK, a subsidiary of Israel’s largest weapons manufacturer, in August 2024.\n\nLess than a year later, after other activists broke into an airbase in Oxfordshire and allegedly spray-painted two Voyager refuelling and transport planes, the UK proscribed Palestine Action, the group which claimed responsibility for both incidents, as a “terrorist” organisation.\n\n“We were some of the first activists in a very long time to be treated as terrorists,” Head said. “That had a massive impact on our treatment inside the carceral system.”\n\nShe said family and friends encountered overly burdensome administrative difficulties when trying to arrange prison visits while the books she wanted to read were screened, claims that are consistent with the accounts of other Palestine Action-linked activists and their families, but allegations the Ministry of Justice has previously denied.\n\nHead, whose barrister in court likened her to a suffragette, was released three weeks ago on bail. Convicted of no crime, she had served 18 months in prison, well beyond the UK’s usual six-month pre-trial detention limit.\n\n\n\n‘I was so depressed and so isolated’\n\nAfter she was released, Head’s friend asked what she wanted to eat as one of her first meals.\n\n“I sat there completely overwhelmed, so she just said, ‘Right, pesto pasta’, and I swear nothing has ever tasted that good.”\n\nWhile getting used to her freedom, living in a seaside town and continuing her activism – Al Jazeera interviewed Head at the launch of a new database tracking the repression of pro-Palestine voices – she remembers her lowest points in jail.\n\nDuring her detention, she was moved from Bronzefield prison in southern England to Foston Hall, a facility nearly 250km (155 miles) north, far further from her loved ones.\n\nIn August 2025, about a year after she was arrested, she said she attempted to take her own life at Foston Hall.\n\n“I was so depressed and so isolated and was so aware that the public was just being told these lies about us, by the police, by the right-wing press, by the state itself – I had no power to counter that narrative.\n\n“I tried to take my own life … purely out of powerlessness of being used as a political play piece and having very little recourse to [my] own agency.”\n\nShe said she was taken to an emergency department, “where I was handcuffed to a prison officer the whole time”. After blood tests, she was returned to prison from hospital the following day.\n\nThe prison system’s conditions need “massive” reform, she said.\n\nIn 2025, 29 people died in the UK’s prisons in circumstances officially described as “self-inflicted”, while there were about 75,000 incidents of self-harm.\n\nThe hunger striking activists had also called for improved conditions, demanding an end to what they called censorship in prison, accusing authorities of withholding mail, calls and books.\n\nFounded in 2020, Palestine Action’s stated objective has been to counter Israeli war crimes – and what it says is British complicity in them – by targeting weapons manufacturers and associated companies. Its main target is Elbit Systems, which has several UK sites.\n\nThe Israeli firm produces the drones that are used with deadly effect in Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, but the company’s UK subsidiary denies that it supplies the Israeli military.\n\nAll Palestine Action-linked activists have denied the charges against them.\n\nHead is said to have driven a van into the Bristol site, using it as a “battering ram” to get inside the factory.\n\n“It’s so painful to see that so little has changed in Palestine, that the genocide has continued unabated,” she said. “It’s horrifying, but it confirms what we’ve known all along, that state actors like Israel, the US and the UK were never going to abide by international law and that we must continue to voice our opposition and try to bring about true justice for Palestine.”\n\n\n\nNew protests against Elbit Systems UK\n\nIn recent weeks, in a dizzying turn of events, the High Court ruled that the Palestine Action ban was unlawful and all “Filton24” defendants have been acquitted of aggravated burglary. Twenty-three of the 24 were bailed in two rounds, including a group that participated in a life-threatening hunger strike. Only one, Samuel Corner, remains in jail. He faces an additional charge of causing grievous bodily harm to a police officer.\n\nThe jury reached partial or no verdicts on the counts of criminal damage and violent disorder, so Head and other activists now face a retrial.\n\nOn the Palestine Action ban, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has been granted permission to appeal the High Court ruling.\n\nMeanwhile, Elbit Systems UK continues to be targeted.\n\nOn Thursday, activists affiliated with a group called People Against Genocide claimed to have blocked the Elbit UK Systems site in Bristol by “locking on”, a protest tactic that involves attaching oneself to an object.\n\n“The arms firm claim that the Filton facility is a research, development, and manufacturing hub, but quadcopter drones, of the exact type used to kill civilians in Gaza, have previously been discovered here, ready to be shipped to the Israeli military,” they said.\n\nAvon and Somerset Police told Al Jazeera that three people “causing disruption” had been arrested for offences relating to “locking on, contrary to the Public Order Act 2003”.\n\nAt the time of publishing, Elbit Systems UK and the Ministry of Justice had not responded to Al Jazeera’s request for comment."

            "content": "A local governor says authorities found two mass graves in the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira which the rebel M23 group seized in December.\n\nCongolese authorities and a civil society group have said that mass graves were found in a part of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where the M23 rebel group has recently withdrawn from, as fighting in the region escalates despite a United States-mediated peace deal.\n\nThe governor of South Kivu province, Jean-Jacques Purusi, told The Associated Press news agency on Thursday that authorities found two mass graves with at least 171 bodies in the Kiromoni and Kavimvira neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira.\n\n“At this stage, we have identified two sites: one mass grave containing approximately 30 bodies in Kiromoni, not far from the Burundian border on the Congolese side, and another in Kavimvira where 141 bodies were found,” Purusi told AP over the phone.\n\nThe Executive Secretariat of the Local Network for the Protection of Civilians, a civil society group in the region, said on Thursday it wanted to visit the mass graves but was prevented from doing so by the Congolese military.\n\nInformation gathered so far indicates that the victims were killed by M23 rebels, said Yves Ramadhani, the group’s vice president.\n\nThe governor and the civil society group alleged that the rebels killed the individuals because they suspected them of belonging to the DRC army or a pro-government militia.\n\nBoth the DRC military and M23 have been accused of extrajudicial killings and abuses by rights groups. Al Jazeera could not independently verify Purusi’s or the group’s claims.\n\n\n\nThe M23 is the most prominent of the more than 100 armed groups that are vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern DRC, near the border with Rwanda.\n\nM23 has been in a tense and violent conflict with the DRC government for more than a decade. The first fighting began in 2012 but de-escalated the next year, only to resume in 2021.\n\nThen, in January 2025, the rebels gained ground, seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, before taking Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu, the following month. And in December, the group seized control of Uvira in an offensive that killed more than 1,500 people and forced about 300,000 to flee, according to regional authorities.\n\nThe rebel group later announced it would withdraw from the city, in what it said was a “unilateral trust-building measure” requested by the US to facilitate the peace process.\n\nM23 claims it is fighting for the rights of the minority Tutsi community, who it says has been marginalised by the state. The DRC government has condemned the rebels and neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting them, for seizing land and resources.\n\nLast year, two separate peace negotiation processes took place – one between DRC and M23 mediated by Qatar, and a separate one between Kinshasa and Kigali mediated by the US.\n\nDespite agreed ceasefires, fighting has continued in the east of the country.\n\nThe conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people displaced, according to the UN agency for refugees, and thousands killed.\n\nMore than 200 people were also killed in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern DRC last month."

            "content": "Critics are wary of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to send the military to tackle crime, drugs and gangs in three provinces.\n\nCape Town, South Africa – Two ominous letters are spray-painted on a wall at the entrance to Tafelsig, a township in Mitchells Plain on the outskirts of Cape Town: HL – the insignia of the Hard Livings gang, which has threatened communities there for five decades.\n\nIt’s a February day soon after the president’s state of the nation address, in which Cyril Ramaphosa boldly announced he’d be deploying the army to communities across South Africa to tackle the growing crisis of crime, drugs and gangs. But in Tafelsig, which will likely be part of the new military operation, most people seem unbothered by the news.\n\nMitchells Plain is on the Cape Flats – a series of densely populated, impoverished townships about 30km (19 miles) southeast of the wealthy city centre where the president made his speech. While the city boasts hordes of tourists and some of the most expensive real estate on the continent, the Cape Flats accounts for the highest rate of gang-related killings in the country.\n\n“When it was at its worst, [there was a shooting] almost every day,” said Michael Jacobs, the chairperson of a local community police forum.\n\n“Whether it’s day or whether it’s night, they’re shooting somewhere on the Cape Flats,” he added on a drive through the settlement of run-down houses and corrugated iron shacks.\n\nAround him, residents made their way to a home-grown tuck shop, known as a spaza, or sat on street corners while toddlers ran about.\n\n“How is this conducive to raising children?” he asked, recounting the horrors of life in Mitchells Plain.\n\n\n\nIn the past week, four people, including a nine-month-old, had been shot and killed in a drug den in Athlone, about 17km (10 miles) away.\n\nA beloved Muslim cleric who is rumoured to have angered a gang leader over a personal dispute was also shot dead on the first day of Ramadan as he was leaving the Salaamudien Mosque on a nearby street.\n\nAs Jacobs spoke, reports of other shootings filtered through on the many crime groups he is part of on WhatsApp. A few days later, he shared with Al Jazeera a video of two schoolgirls and a taxi driver shot outside a school in Atlantis, about 40km (25 miles) north of Cape Town. One of the girls died.\n\nTafelsig residents now await the probable arrival of uniformed soldiers and armed vehicles in their neighbourhood, but have little hope that it will make a difference.\n\nDespite his weariness with the violence, Jacobs is far from enthusiastic about a decision to deploy the army.\n\nOther critics of the government’s decision said it is window dressing more than a real solution while some question the wisdom of such a drastic step in a country where the military has a history of brutality and where recent explosive allegations about police corruption at the highest levels have surfaced.\n\n‘Do our lives not matter?’\n\nIn his speech on February 12, Ramaphosa said he would deploy the army to the Western Cape, the province that includes the Cape Flats, and Gauteng, home to the country’s largest city, Johannesburg, to tackle gang violence and illegal mining. On February 17, Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia announced that the Eastern Cape would be added to the list and a deployment would take place in 10 days – although no soldiers have so far been deployed.\n\nThe president’s decision followed pressure from civil society groups and the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, which runs the Western Cape, to take drastic action to curb widespread gang-related violence in the three provinces.\n\nA day before its province was added to the deployment schedule, the DA joined residents in Gqeberha, the largest city in the Eastern Cape, for a “Do Our Lives Not Matter?” protest to demand that Ramaphosa take urgent action.\n\nIn Gauteng, neighbourhoods surrounding the province’s once-lucrative abandoned mines have often been turned into battlegrounds, resulting in shootouts between police and illegal artisanal miners, known as zama zamas.\n\nGauteng and the Western Cape frequently appear at the top of the country’s organised crime lists while the Eastern Cape made headlines last year for a series of killings linked to extortion syndicates.\n\n\n\nIn the latest crime statistics, police announced the arrests of 15,846 suspects nationwide and the seizure of 173 firearms and 2,628 rounds of ammunition from February 16 to Sunday alone.\n\nGauteng took up the most space in the police’s crime highlights, which included a 16-year-old arrested in Roodepoort for possession and distribution of explosives and the seizure of counterfeit clothing and shoes worth 98 million rand ($6.1m).\n\nOverall, South Africa has some of the world’s most violent crime with an average of 64 people killed every day, according to official statistics.\n\nThe three provinces selected for military deployments have a turbulent history with the armed forces, not least during the apartheid era when the regime used soldiers to unleash deadly crackdowns on antiapartheid activists.\n\n“They were the enemy,” Jacobs said, recalling his own arrest in September 1987 during a student protest on the Cape Flats opposing the racist government, which was replaced in the country’s first democratic elections in 1994.\n\nToday after three decades of democracy, poverty, unemployment and violent crime remain a major challenge in the area.\n\nBut Jacobs, like other critics of the military police, believes the new move will do little to cure the ills that he said gangs exploit to increase their influence. Children as young as eight years old are recruited into their ranks.\n\nThe Town Centre, a shopping mall that was once a hub of economic activity, has been reduced to a ghost town where the drug trade thrives despite the fact that it is right next to a police station, according to Jacobs.\n\nFor him, there is a direct link between the country’s economic decline and the flourishing of gang activity over the past decade on the Cape Flats, where working-class people have seen their livelihoods stripped away as the manufacturing sector shrank.\n\nOn an average weekday when children should be at school, he said, you see children and even women in their 60s in Mitchells Plain digging through rubbish bins to find glass, plastic or other things they can recycle and turn into income. “At least it will put something on the table.”\n\nPlugging a ‘haemorrhage’\n\nSocial issues and not simply military intervention should be put at the heart of government anticrime efforts, analysts say.\n\n“There’s no other way to describe it other than plugging a hole that is haemorrhaging at the moment with regards to these forms of organised crime,” said Ryan Cummings, director of analysis at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused risk management firm.\n\nIrvin Kinnes, an associate professor with the University of Cape Town’s Centre for Criminology, pointed out that constitutionally the army is limited in the duties its members may perform among the civilian population. Their role will be largely to support police, who will retain control of all operations.\n\nHe fears the government has not learned lessons from previous army deployments in South Africa’s democratic era.\n\n\n\nThe army was dispatched to the Western Cape in 2019 during a previous spike in gang violence and was again sent in to help with the enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions the following year.\n\n“It’s a very dangerous thing to bring the army because there’s an impatience with the fact that the police are not doing their job. And so they come in with that mentality and want to beat up everybody and break people’s bones,” Kinnes said.\n\n“We saw what happened in COVID. They killed people as the army. It’s not as if the police don’t kill people, but the point is, you don’t need the army to do that.”\n\nTo the government’s detractors, summoning the army is nothing more than an attempt at political heroics before local elections due to be held this year or in early 2027.\n\nKinnes pointed out that, according to police statistics, crime has been decreasing without the help of the army.\n\n“It’s very much political. It’s to show that the political leaders have kind of heard the public. But the call for the army hasn’t come from the community. It’s come from politicians,” he said.\n\n‘The military is ready’\n\nRamaphosa, who has yet to reveal details of the military deployment, has defended his decision. On Monday in his weekly newsletter, the president sought to separate the South African armed forces from their troubling past, listing several operations that benefitted communities, such as disaster relief efforts and law enforcement operations at the border.\n\nHe made it clear that the army’s role would merely be a supporting one “with clear rules of engagement and for specific time-limited objectives”.\n\nIts presence may free up officers to focus on police work and would take place alongside other measures, such as strengthening antigang units and illegal mining teams, he said.\n\n“Given our history, where the apartheid state sent the army into townships to violently suppress opposition, it is important that we do not deploy the [military] inside the country to deal with domestic threats without good reason,” Ramaphosa wrote.\n\nCummings said it was clear the president’s hand was forced amid an unrelenting wave of violence. “The rhetoric of the president up until now suggests that this was a directive that he was not necessarily too keen on implementing.”\n\nOn the ground, soldiers appear equally reluctant about their pending engagement.\n\nNtsiki Shongo is a soldier who was deployed in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. He told Al Jazeera, using a pseudonym, that any operation involving the police was almost certainly doomed.\n\n“We [in the army] become so negative when we are working with them [the police] because always we don’t get what we need,” he said.\n\n“We know how easy it is to get these gangsters, to get these drug lords, but unfortunately, the police, they are not cooperating with us because some of them are in cooperation with these criminals,” he charged. “Maybe they are scared for their lives because they are staying in the same areas with them.”\n\nShongo referred to an ongoing commission investigating police corruption that has implicated senior government officials and led to the suspension of national Police Minister Senzo Mchunu.\n\n“So this operation, … is it going to be a success? I don’t know. It all depends on the police,” he said, adding that he and his fellow soldiers long for the day the government lets the military solve the problem on its own.\n\n\n\n“Even when we are just sitting having lunch as soldiers, we talk about the police. We pray that one day the state can say, ‘Let’s take the military inside the country and clean out all these weapons, all these guns, all these gangsters,’” he said.\n\n“The military is ready, and they want to prove a point because we’ve been hungry for these things.”"

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” — a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer and browser, allowing it to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans while you do something else.\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis. Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow? Seems like we need to ask Apple and Google why they chose differently."

That’s according to the latest report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), which forecasts smartphone shipments to plummet 12.9 percent this year, marking its “lowest annual shipment volume in more than a decade.”\n\nAt the same time, the average selling price for smartphones is set to hit new highs, with IDC predicting a 14 percent increase to a record $523. “While memory prices are projected to stabilize by mid-2027, they are unlikely to return to previous level,” IDC senior researcher Nabila Popal says, adding that the sub-$100 phone segment will become “permanently uneconomical.” Next week, Apple is rumored to announce a new edition of its budget smartphone as the “iPhone 17e,” which could give a hint about where things are going.\n\nThe memory shortage is expected to impact budget-friendly Android smartphones the most, as the rising costs of components leave them with “no choice but to pass the costs on to end users,” Francisco Jeronimo, the vice president for IDC’s Worldwide Client Devices, says in the report. That could result in smaller brands exiting the industry, while allowing Apple and Samsung to grab more market share, according to Popal."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

            "content": "Ultrahuman on Friday unveiled a new smart ring with longer battery life and a redesigned form factor, as the Bengaluru-based wearable maker seeks to revive its U.S. business that was disrupted last year by a patent dispute with rival Oura.\n\nThe Ring Pro, Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, offers up to 15 days of battery life — compared with four to six days on the Ring Air — and is priced at $479. It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.\n\nUltrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — ruled in Oura’s favor in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.\n\nIn August 2025, Ultrahuman also filed a separate patent infringement case against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.\n\nMeanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance. U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance to confirm it can legally be imported into the country.\n\nDespite the U.S. disruption, Ultrahuman is currently operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $150 million, Kumar said. It reported $64 million in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.\n\nAlongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nKumar said Jade is designed to move beyond retrospective health summaries toward real-time, actionable guidance.\n\nUltrahuman’s Jade AI system Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\n“Most AI tools today look backward at your data,” he said. “Jade is built to react to your health in real time and surface actions users can take.”\n\nKumar said Jade will be available to all Ultrahuman users, including those using the older Ring Air, and does not currently require a subscription.\n\nThe Ring Pro features a redesigned heart-rate sensing architecture for improved signal quality during sleep and a new dual-core processor to enhance data accuracy and on-device computing. The device can store up to 250 days of health data and weighs about 5% to 6% more than the Ring Air, launched in July 2023 at $349.\n\nUltrahuman has also introduced a Pro Charger with up to 45 days of battery life to support on-the-go charging and enable faster updates and diagnostics through direct case connectivity. The charger also supports wireless charging via Qi, the same standard used by most modern smartphones.\n\nUltrahuman’s Pro Charger Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\nWomen account for about 68% of Ultrahuman’s user base, up from roughly 65% a year earlier, Kumar said, reflecting strong adoption of the startup’s women’s health features.\n\nUltrahuman also offers subscription-based services across its broader health platform, including a coaching and recovery program called PowerPlugs, the Blood Vision metabolic panel, Ultrahuman Home, and a continuous glucose monitoring offering. Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.\n\nUltrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.\n\nGlobal smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.\n\nJain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.\n\nSeparate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.\n\nFounded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.\n\nUltrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks.

            "content": "Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said Thursday that he “cannot in good conscience accede to [the Pentagon’s] request” to give the military unrestricted access to its AI systems.\n\n“Anthropic understands that the Department of War, not private companies, makes military decisions,” Amodei wrote in a statement. “However, in a narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values. Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

There’s no need to be nasty about it.”"

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

            "content": "Hair loss isn’t always dramatic. It can be incremental. You start noticing a bit more scalp in harsh bathroom lighting; a tiny bald spot when you tie your hair up in a ponytail. The shower drain is more clogged than usual. Not long ago, hair loss treatments meant topical remedies, supplements, or a flight to Turkey. Luckily, red light therapy brings the potential for hair regrowth into your home—no clinical appointment required.\n\nBeyond skin rejuvenation, research suggests red light therapy can help energize hair follicles, increase blood circulation in the scalp, reduce inflammation, and lower dihydrotestosterone levels—a hormone that causes hair loss and thinning. Red light therapy also supports adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which helps provide oxygen and blood flow to the scalp and triggers follicles to remain in the hair growth phase.\n\nTo determine the best red light therapy for hair growth, I tapped three WIRED tech reviewers who've dealt with hair loss themselves. We assessed red light therapy caps, hands-free helmets with full scalp coverage, and low-level laser therapy or photobiomodulation devices for 16 weeks. Along the way, we reviewed the research, spoke with dermatologists, and tracked ease of use. These are the favorites that produced meaningful results and earned our trust.\n\nBe sure to check out our other hair care guides, including Best Dry Shampoos, Best Heat Protectant Sprays, and Best Hair Dryers.\n\nBest Red Light Helmet\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet $860 CurrentBody WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Simple device with only one button and a charging port\n\nBluetooth-enabled so you can listen to your own tunes during treatment\n\nComes with a stand for easy storage\n\nObserved new hair on scalp after 12-ish weeks TIRED Need to use daily for at least four months to achieve results, and use regularly (nearly every day) for maintenance\n\nEven the smallest helmet size is large\n\nBuffer cups can snag and pull hair during helmet removal\n\nEar cups can be somewhat difficult to adjust while worn\n\nCurrentBody's LED Hair Growth Helmet is a wearable, cord-free, Bluetooth-enabled device aimed at improving hair’s density, thickness, and overall condition. Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee say they’ve identified more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses tied to identity theft connected to four major breaches involving data broker firms. The estimate was released Friday in a minority report stemming from a months-long inquiry into data broker practices launched by United States senator Maggie Hassan.\n\nHassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the JEC’s ranking member, sent investigative requests to five major data brokers—Comscore, Findem, IQVIA Digital, Telesign, and 6Sense Insights—in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines using “no index” instructions that tell web crawlers not to list the page.\n\nScammers are shown to use the kind of sensitive data that companies like these hold—including identifiers like dates of birth, addresses, and even Social Security numbers—to target victims with personalized fraud.\n\nFour of the companies took steps after Hassan’s outreach to improve access to opt-out options, including by removing the “no index” code, adding more prominent links, and posting guidance on exercising privacy rights.\n\nFindem, however, did not respond to Hassan or to committee staff follow-up, and staff said the company has not removed the “no index” code from its page. WIRED’s calls to Findem on Thursday went unanswered.\n\nThe report says Findem’s “failure to respond” to the lawmakers’ inquiries raises “serious, broad questions about its responsiveness to opt-out requests and commitment to data privacy,” adding that its own mandatory disclosures from 2024 show the company “did not process 80 percent of privacy requests from consumers and other parties,” citing “insufficient data.”\n\nIQVIA, 6sense, and Comscore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Telesign routes press inquiries through an online form that requires reporters to consent to receiving marketing communications, which was not used for that reason; instead, a company email address that appeared in previously leaked breach data was tried.\n\nThe Markup/CalMatters investigation found that dozens of California-registered data brokers were using the “no index” code and other so-called dark patterns that make opt-out and deletion pages harder to find. “In doing so,” the JEC minority report says, “the companies made it more difficult for people to protect their information from scammers.”\n\nComscore told the committee it reviewed its website after receiving Hassan’s request and found that its “Data Subject Rights” page—which directs users to separate forms for submitting opt-out requests—contained a “no index” code. The company said it traced the code, which it removed, back to an earlier version of the page created in 2003. The report says the company could not determine why it was added, but suggested it was “not intended to prevent consumer access.”\n\nTelesign confirmed that its opt-out form, hosted on a “Privacy Request” page, was not appearing in search results at the time of the Markup/CalMatters reporting; it attributed the issue to a third-party SEO tool that restricts visibility by default, and says it has now enabled indexing and added a footer link to the form.\n\nJEC staff say Telesign’s approach still forces consumers to look beyond its main site and, even where links exist, they’re often buried on pages users wouldn’t reasonably think to check—including privacy notice pages exceeding 9,000 words.\n\n6sense disputed that its main “Privacy Center” was hidden, but acknowledged that its “Privacy Policy” page—which links to opt-out tools—previously carried “no index” code, adding that it removed the code after the Markup/CalMatters report. 6sense was the only company to report using third-party audits to assess both the visibility of opt-out options and whether the requests are being successfully processed, the report says."

I purchased my favorite from our extensive list of the Best Power Banks, which features hand-tested picks from my fellow WIRED Reviews gadget experts.

The transparent housing and triangle shape are cool, but the battery also performs well, with a 24,000-mAh capacity, a maximum output of 170 watts, and even a little bit of water resistance. There's a display that'll show you battery life, time remaining until a full charge, and the input or output in watts. The battery itself charges up in a little under an hour, provided you have the right cable and charger, and it can top off three devices simultaneously."

The two phones are largely similar, even rocking the same chipset. The Pixel 10a does come in some new colors, though, like Fog and Lavender, and the phone is slightly thinner, with a less noticeable camera bump. The screen is a little brighter and a little more scratch-resistant, and the device is made with more recycled materials.\n\nHowever, there are some software changes in the 10a compared to the 9a. The Pixel 10a is getting some of the same AI features as you’d find in the Pixel 10, plus support for AirDrop as well. The battery lasts up to 30 hours on a single charge, and the phone will have seven years of software and security updates. We can help you decide which Google Pixel to order, and if you decide on the 10a, these gift card deals are definitely worth it (especially if you were already planning on spending money at Amazon or Best Buy anyway)."

            "content": "Lowe’s Home Improvement grew the old-fashioned way, working its way up from a single, small, family-owned North Carolina general store founded in 1921. But the Lowe’s hardware store empire is plenty big these days. A tool-filled Lowe’s superstore is now about as big as a New York City block. The focus stays mostly on appliances and tools for the home DIYer, more than large building contractors. I like to pop in for grill and griddle tools, or just some propane. But you can also buy a pre-finished door complete with the frame—or the lumber, sanders, routers, and saws you’d use to make your own door, including the hinges and the wood stain. It’s easy to get lost in the endless aisles if you love the smell of plaster and wood dust, but it’s easier to find the best Lowe’s deals on the website. This roundup includes Lowe’s daily deals, a promo code, and Lowe's offer code for 40% off appliances, plus info on the Lowe’s rewards program and military discounts.\n\nQuick Ways to Save at Lowe’s: Text Alerts and Daily Deals\n\nLowe’s wants to be able to tell you about its deals, hoping you’ll be tempted to take advantage of them. If you’re a consistent DIYer, it’s likely worth getting a heads-up on the Lowe’s Deals of the Day, delivered to your phone via text message. This might be anything from drills to snow blowers or lawn mowers, plus the best package deals on appliances, refrigerators, washers, and dryers. Each of these deals is one-day only. If you \n\nJoin the MyLowe’s Rewards Program, Get Maximum Benefits\n\nIf you’re planning on doing some major work this year, or just like to putter around, it’s probably worth picking up a MyLowe’s Rewards Program membership. Each eligible purchase accrues points that’ll pay out in increments of $5 in-store credit at Lowe’s. Like a lot of loyalty programs, you get more benefits if you spend more at the store, including free shipping on all purchases including the small ones, member-only discounts, and point boosters for better discounts.\n\nThere are three tiers of memberships, depending what you buy. One large appliance might already qualify you for the highest tier of rewards, at which point you might as well. These are the three tiers, based on the total cost of what you’ve bought at Lowe’s in the past year. Bronze ($0-$499): $35 minimum for free shipping; 1 point per $1 spent. Silver ($500-$1,999): Free shipping; 1.25 points per $1 spent. Gold ($2,000+): Free shipping; 1.5 points per $1 spent.\n\nFor contractors, there’s a separate MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Program that offers Lowe’s in-store credit in increments of $1 for every 100 points earned. (Points expire in half-yearly increments, on June 30 and December 31.) Benefits include member-only deals, volume discounts, free standard shipping in the contiguous United States, and a 20% paint discount after annual spend of $3,000 or more. Other benefits include analytics and spend reports, online order quoting, and purchase authorization for specified crew members.\n\n10% Military Discount, Plus Free MyLowe’s Silver Status\n\nAll verified active military, veterans, and military spouses are eligible for a 10% discount on full-price items—meaning things don’t have to be on sale to be on sale. This is available through what Lowe’s calls the Everyday Military Discount program. When you enroll, you also get an immediate upgrade to Silver status on the MyLowe’s Rewards program, which means more rewards points earned per dollar, and free shipping on all orders in the contiguous United States.\n\nGet a free Silver status upgrade instantly when you enroll in our Military Discount program and validate through ID.me. MyLowe’s Rewards Silver status members receive free standard shipping (excludes AK and HI) and earn more points per dollar.\n\nSave 5% on Everyday Purchases at Lowe’s\n\nLike a lot of big retailers, Lowe’s also has a store credit card with discounts attached. The MyLowe’s Rewards Credit Card offers 5% off qualified purchases, with a whole bunch of asterisks. Specifically, the discount applies after all other discounts and can’t be combined with other programs like contractor bulk discounts, employee discounts, or military discounts. It also doesn’t work on Weber, Miele, or Kichler products. Scroll to the bottom here, for APR and exceptions. The smart person signs up during a big purchase: When you sign up and get approved, you get 20% off an in-store purchase (up to $100 off).\n\nAnother way to get 5% off on items you need regularly is to set up a Lowe’s subscription. This is good for items ranging from cleaning products, air and water filters, lawn care, pet goods, plumbing, and batteries. Shipping is free, and delivery happens automatically."

            "content": "Iowa lawmakers voted to advance state House bill 751 last week, legislation that would ensure farmers in the state can freely repair their own agricultural equipment, like tractors. This Tuesday, the bill was renamed to House File 2709, and it will be voted on again. Should the political winds align, it will go through the Iowa House and Senate before the Iowa Legislature adjourns on April 21.\n\nThe bill is the first of nearly 57 state bills supported by repair advocates across the country in 2026. Many of them focus on farm equipment in states like Oklahoma, Wyoming, Delaware, and West Virginia. Repair advocates hope a win in Iowa—the second-highest-grossing state in the US for agricultural products, behind California—will help further legislative and broader efforts to make phones, cars, and other devices more repairable.\n\n“This isn't just a blue state thing; this isn't just a Colorado activist thing,” says Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability for the right-to-repair advocate arm of iFixit. “Its real. Farmers have trouble repairing their equipment and want change.”\n\nFarmers and their tractors have long been a focal point of the right-to-repair movement, the ever-growing global effort to let product owners fix their own devices and equipment without manufacturer approval. Farmers who use tractors to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops often need to repair their equipment while they work. Waiting for manufacturer approval to get something fixed, or taking the time to bring the equipment to an approved dealership, can cause delays, frustration, and missed opportunities to harvest crops.\n\nThe Iowa bill defines which agricultural equipment it covers, including tractors, trailers, combines, sprayers, balers, and other equipment used to cultivate and harvest crops. It excludes aircraft and irrigation equipment, along with jet skis and snowmobiles.\n\nManufacturers would also be required to provide owners with data—documentation, like manuals, and access to embedded operating software—on their tractors, including future patches and fixes, all without charging for it or requiring authorization for internet access. The bill also limits the use of digital locks—software restrictions that prevent accessing features without manufacturer approval.\n\nOh Deere\n\nThe most prominent opposition to the Iowa bill is tractor manufacturer John Deere, which has a long history of opposing repair efforts and frustrating farmers who want to take more control of their equipment. The company is still fighting a lawsuit the US Federal Trade Commission levied against John Deere in January 2025 for “unlawful” repairability policies. The company has lobbied against the Iowa bill and outright opposes its passing.\n\n“John Deere is steadfast in supporting farmers' ability to repair their equipment,” wrote a John Deere representative in a statement responding to WIRED’s inquiry. “And we back that up by offering industry-leading self-repair tools and resources to both equipment owners and alternative service providers.”\n\nJohn Deere points to its online repair hub that catalogs ways its product owners can repair their products. Chamberlain says it is true that John Deere offers self-repair options, but they are not always in line with the reality of what farmers need to make fixes in the moment.\n\n“Ultimately, it doesn’t matter if the vast majority of repairs are possible if there’s a repair that takes your equipment down and that means loss of harvest or having to wait weeks for a dealer representative to come out,” Chamberlain says.\n\nJohn Deere has said it supports third-party and self-repair of its equipment before. In 2023, John Deere and the American Farm Bureau agreed to a memorandum of understanding about how the company would allow access to repairs on its products in response to repair laws passing in states like Colorado. But repair advocates criticized the move, saying the memorandum did little to make John Deere adhere to new regulations."

Click here for our daily Strands hints, as well as our daily answers and hints for The New York Times Mini Crossword, Wordle, Connections and Connections: Sports Edition puzzles.\n\nToday's NYT Strands puzzle was tough for me. Some of the answers are long and difficult to unscramble, so if you need hints and answers, read on.\n\nI go into depth about the rules for Strands in this story.\n\nIf you're looking for today's Wordle, Connections and Mini Crossword answers, you can visit CNET's NYT puzzle hints page.\n\n\n\nHint for today's Strands puzzle\n\nToday's Strands theme is: It's a little much\n\n\n\nIf that doesn't help you, here's a clue: Whoa, that's plenty!\n\nClue words to unlock in-game hints\n\nYour goal is to find hidden words that fit the puzzle's theme. If you're stuck, find any words you can. Every time you find three words of four letters or more, Strands will reveal one of the theme words. These are the words I used to get those hints, but any words of four or more letters that you find will work:\n\nLURE, HARK, HARKEN, LATE, SORE, ROSE, TEAL, LATER, GLUE, GLUED, PLUS, LESS, GLARE\n\nAnswers for today's Strands puzzle\n\nThese are the answers that tie into the theme. The goal of the puzzle is to find them all, including the spangram, a theme word that reaches from one side of the puzzle to the other. When you have all of them (I originally thought there were always eight but learned that the number can vary), every letter on the board will be used.

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

            "content": "The projected shortage of memory chips worldwide will have a more serious impact on smartphone sales in 2026 than previously projected, according to new data from International Data Corporation Worldwide. Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

            "content": "During Nvidia's quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said that agentic AI has reached \"an inflection point\" and that AI agents are \"solving real problems.\"\n\nThe company's powerful chips have been at the heart of the AI boom over the last few years, especially for use in data centers -- so much so that Nvidia's annual revenue for fiscal 2026 zoomed to $216 billion, up 65% from the previous year.\n\nHuang called Nvidia an AI infrastructure company, a dramatic evolution from the graphics card company it started as.\n\nThe term agentic AI has been floating around for some time, but now the technology is becoming available for real-world use. Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."
