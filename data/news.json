However, under current circumstances we believe it is best to change managers.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at the club, the board and personally, I would like to thank Frank for his work as head coach and wish him every success in the future.”"

The Reds finished third in the league phase, securing their passage to the knock-out rounds.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Reds will now face either a reunion with Atletico Madrid or Galatasaray in the last-16. Both sides are capable of inflicting damage on Arne Slot's side as demonstrated this season alone.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLiverpool famously beat Atletico 3-2 at Anfield in November with the Spanish giant's manager, Diego Simeone, sent off.

Mirror Football takes a look at Alexander-Arnold's feelings on returning to the Reds while Simeone has also shared his thoughts on playing Liverpool.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold's feelings clear\n\nSpeaking after Real Madrid dispatched Benfica to claim their place in the last-16, Alexander-Arnold made his feelings clear that he and his team are ready for any challenge that comes their way.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRed Bull break silence on Jurgen Klopp quit claims after Man Utd job offer leaked READ MORE :\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold slammed by Spanish media as Real Madrid reality sets in READ MORE :\n\nAlexander-Arnold has already returned to Liverpool once this season, with Slot's side beating Los Blancos 1-0 in November. The ex-Reds full-back started the game on the bench but was met with a chorus of boos as he made his way to the pitch late in the second half.\n\nLiverpool and Madrid could now meet each other again, in the semi-finals or final, depending on who the Reds draw in the last-16. The England defender isn't fearful of meeting his old side, however, declaring there is no reason why Madrid shouldn't go on to claim their 16th European Cup.\n\nView 3 Images Alexander-Arnold played 90 minutes against Benfica (Image: Quality Sport Images, Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't about sending a message to anyone, it was about winning the game and letting our football do the talking,\" Alexander-Arnold said.\n\n\"At the start of every season, our aim is to win this competition.

We're more than ready to face whatever challenges come next.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReunion on the cards\n\nWhoever Liverpool draw, be it Atletico or Galatasaray, a reunion is on the cards with either Atletico or Galatasaray. Goals from Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson and a late winner from Virgil van Dijk ensured the Reds beat Atletico 3-2 in a heated affair at Anfield in September.\n\nIt was a game memorable for a stunning meltdown from Atletico boss Simeone that saw him receive a red card. After beating Club Brugge to cement Atletico's place in the last-16, Simeone even claimed he is “not thinking about Liverpool”.\n\nLiverpool have played Atletico nine times since 2008. The Reds have won four of those ties, drawn two and lost three. Simeone's side have eliminated Liverpool on the two occasions the clubs have met in European knock-out competition: back in 2020 in the Champions League and in the 2010 Europa League semi-finals.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Diego Simeone was sent off against Liverpool earlier this season (Image: Marc Atkins/Getty Images)\n\nLiverpool have faced Galatasaray on five occasions in European competition.

United have 16 points from a possible 18 under the interim boss and have seemingly benefited from fresh legs while rivals deal with a busier fixture list.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn today's round-up, our focus moves onto the summer transfer window and the moves the club will and won't be making.

In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren’t going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, ‘Well, with Mauricio we played good football,’ or whatever it may be.\n\n\"But no. We’re focused on the World Cup, on the United States. My contract runs until after the World Cup, so after that we’ll see what might happen. Open to everything, right?”\n\nIan Wright and Gary Neville clash as Igor Tudor forced to deny worrying Tottenham theory READ MORE :\n\nTudor took over earlier this month on an interim basis until the end of the season with the sole aim of avoiding relegation.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe replaced Frank, who was sacked earlier this month, having managed just two wins from 17 Premier League games. Spurs are also yet to win in 2026.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\nThat continued this past weekend with defeat to Arsenal in the north London Derby, which saw the gap to the bottom three reduced to four points following West Ham's draw against Bournemouth.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino is seemingly the leading contender to be Frank's permanent successor with Spurs in need of a head coach who can galvanise the fanbase.\n\nThough he did not win any trophies, the Pochettino years are reflected upon fondly with Tottenham going close in two Premier League title races. They also reached the Champions League final in 2019, but lost to Liverpool.\n\nPochettino was sacked just months after that showpiece clash with Spurs appointing Jose Mourinho as his replacement. Nuno Espirito Santo, Antonio Conte, Ange Postecoglou and Frank have followed as permanent managers since then.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Tottenham sacked Thomas Frank earlier this month (Image: Joe Toth/Shutterstock)\n\nRoberto De Zerbi, Robbie Keane and Enzo Maresca have been touted as possible alternatives to Pochettino.\n\nOther big names such as Julian Nagelsmann and Carlo Ancelotti could also be available after the World Cup, but Manchester United are more likely to appoint one of those.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhat division Tottenham are in next season will likely play a huge role in the type of candidate they can appoint. If he does not get the permanent job at Old Trafford, Michael Carrick, who also played for Spurs, is a serious option.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. **Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings"

            "content": "Nottingham Forest survived a scare from Fenerbahce to book their Europa League last-16 place, winning 4-2 on aggregate despite a 2-1 defeat at the City ground in Thursday's second leg.\n\nVitor Pereira had the luxury of rotation for the knockout play-off tie, having already won 3-0 in Istanbul last week, but the difference in performances could not have been more vast.\n\nForest were the architects of their own difficulties too, and made a seemingly simple task monumentally harder.\n\nThey were first punished in the 22nd minute when Fenerbahce's ruthless break saw Kerem Akturkoglu sweep home to hand the visitors a lifeline.\n\nIt gave Fenerbahce real confidence, with Akturkoglu and Sidiki Cherif squandering glorious chances to level up the tie in the first half.\n\nImage: The game was stopped mere seconds after kick-off after Fenerbahce fans threw flares onto the pitch\n\nForest players forced to dodge Fenerbahce fireworks Forest players were forced to dodge fireworks thrown on to the pitch by Fenerbahce fans.\n\n\n\nMoments after the match kicked off, there was a three-minute delay as sections of a 1,500-strong away end launched several fireworks on to the pitch into the Forest penalty area.\n\n\n\nJair Cunha had to take evasive action as he had his back to them and Neco Williams also had to duck as he tried to carry one away.\n\n\n\nFenerbahce's Archie Brown also had to intervene and carry some of the pyrotechnics off the pitch while urging calm from his side’s fans.\n\nAfter 45 minutes with no shots on target, high turnovers and losing duels, Pereira made four half-time changes - something he called \"difficult\" after the game - bringing on Callum Hudson-Odoi, Igor Jesus, Ola Aina and Ibrahim Sangare.\n\nBut seconds into the second half, another clumsy moment handed Fenerbahce a penalty. Jair Cunha stuck a foot out to catch Akturkoglu and, after a VAR check, the on-field decision stood.\n\nImage: Fenerbahce's Kerem Akturkoglu scores his opener against Nottingham Forest\n\nIt was the forward who stepped up and easily slotted home his second of the evening to give the Turkish side real hope of levelling up on aggregate.\n\nBut Forest soon settled into their rhythm as the substitutes worked their magic, even if the approach of careful possession - as they have done so well in their two games under Pereira so far - did little to calm the nerves of the home fans.\n\nImage: Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi scored at the City Ground on Thursday\n\nAnd as the unhappy whistles began, Forest answered. It was two substitutes who combined as Aina's swinging cross found Hudson-Odoi over on the left of the area. He then sped past his defender before hammering home his first European goal of the season into the far corner.\n\nThe relief was palpable around the City Ground, and it took the remaining puff out of injury-hit Fenerbahce. Forest are now in the draw for Friday's last-16 draw, and will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland.\n\nTeam news headlines Only five Nottingham Forest players survived from the weekend's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool - those were Stefan Ortega, Murillo, Neco Williams, Elliot Anderson and Omari Hutchinson.\n\nFenerbache have an injury-hit squad, and only named five outfield players on their bench. The likes of Ederson and Milan Skriniar were among the absentees.\n\nPereira: Changing six players was a risk\n\nNottingham Forest head coach Vitor Pereira: \"When you change half of a team, it's not easy to keep the level, that's my responsibility because we have an important game in three days. By my decision, I try to manage the next game and recover some players. It's not easy. It will change a lot.\n\n\"We are in the moment of the season that we need to think not about one game, but about two games, about the next game. It was a risk because I decided to make six changes in the team. If you have one or two changes the players can be in the middle of the others, and you don't miss the quality.\n\n\"But when you change six players they aren't used to playing 90 minutes. This is the risk and I decide to take this risk. I decide because I need to think about the Brighton game, because it's very important for us. We need to go there with fuel and energy.\n\n\"We conceded a goal and lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at half-time, but I said to the players it's my decision. The game was a dangerous situation for us. They start the second half by scoring the second goal and after we start to play and create.\n\n\"We have a big chance to score the second goal. Ok, this is important to keep in our mind. I know they came here to fight for the result.\"\n\nOn learnings: \"Even for me. If you change five players you don't know what will happen. When the pressure starts to come, under stress it's difficult to be themselves when you don't play every match. In the end, we are in the competition so let's move forward and think about Brighton.\"\n\nVitor Pereira has become the second Nottingham Forest manager this season to lose his first two home games in charge, along with Ange Postecoglou. He's now lost four in a row at home in all competitions (also his last two at Wolves), his worst-ever run as a manager.\n\nHudson-Odoi: We made it difficult for ourselves\n\nImage: Hudson-Odoi scored his first European goal of the season against Fenerbahce\n\nNottingham Forest goalscorer Callum Hudson-Odoi to TNT Sports: \"We made it difficult for ourselves. When you're in the lead and sometimes you can feel a bit comfortable, but we showed a great reaction after they scored the second goal.\n\n\"We wanted to score, which we did. It's important that we're through even if we didn't get the result on the night.\"\n\nOn what Forest needed to do in the second half: \"We needed to up the levels a bit more and focus on what we know is best - that's us on the ball, playing a high press and going to win the ball up high.\n\n\"It was unfortunate to score a second goal straight away in the second half but we reacted very well.\n\n\"In situations like that where they're getting a couple of goals, you've got to calm the game down. They're trying to chase the game, but we had to do what we know best - keep the ball, create more chances and hope to get a goal.\n\n\"When we got the goal, it gave us more breathing space to attack more. We've just got to keep working hard and push ourselves to get results.\"\n\nOn facing either Real Betis or Midtjylland in the last 16: \"No matter who comes, we're going to be prepared and ready for the game.\"\n\nAlthough they have now reached the Europa League last 16 stage, Nottingham Forest have suffered two home defeats in a single major European season for the first time (also lost 2-3 to FC Midtjylland in October).\n\n\n\nFenerbahce registered just their second European away win in England in all competitions (D2 L7), with this their first since beating Man Utd 1-0 in the UEFA Champions League in October 1996.\n\nWhat is the Europa League schedule?\n\nRound of 16 draw: 27 February, 12pm\n\nRound of 16: 12 & 19 March 2026\n\nQuarter-finals: 9 & 16 April 2026\n\nSemi-finals: 30 April & 7 May 2026\n\nFinal: 20 May 2026 (Istanbul)"

The goal, though, lifted an otherwise lacklustre Selhurst atmosphere with spots of empty seats reflective of a collective apathy in south London.\n\nPlayer ratings: Crystal Palace: Henderson (6), Munoz (6), Lacroix (7), Richards (6), Canvot (6), Mitchell (6), Wharton (8), Kamada (7), Sarr (6), Guessand (8), Strand Larsen (6)\n\n\n\nSubs: Hughes (6), Johnson (6)\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Wharton\n\nWhile quality was lacking, Palace continued to push a Zrinjski side who had failed to score and therefore win in any of their Conference League games away from home this season.\n\nIsmaila Sarr was denied by opposition goalkeeper Goran Karacic in a one on one as he spurned one of his several chances, as Palace's endeavour proved more than their quality as the game wore on.\n\nHowever, after Tomi Juric had Palace hearts in their mouths late on as he sent a header wide, Guessand ran through and wrapped up the victory in injury time.\n\nWhat's happening in Friday's draw?\n\nThe Conference League last-16 draw will take place on Friday at 1pm UK time in Nyon, Switzerland.\n\nThe draw will confirm the last-16 ties and also allocate a side of the bracket for every team so they know who they could potentially meet in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\n\nEach of the play-off winners face the sides that finished in the top eight (seeded teams) in the league phase.\n\nPalace will play the second leg of the tie against either Larnaca or Mainz away from home.\n\nGlasner: I've been given assurance of staying but sometimes we don't enjoy the noise\n\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner played down suggestions of a premature Selhurst Park exit but says he has not enjoyed the backlash during his side's difficult spell.\n\nSpeaking to TNT Sports, he said: \"I've had 100-per-cent assurance [of staying on]. For me, the number one is the players, the players believing in the staff and I - and that's the most important thing, otherwise you can pack your suitcase and go home.\n\n\"They have a great togetherness in the group, the staff and it's the same with the chairman and sporting director.\n\n\"They are sometimes wondering - it's the second-best Premier League season ever.\n\n\"The best was last year, so maybe the best two in Palace's history, playing European football for the first time, and there is so much noise so sometimes we really don't understand it.\n\n\"Maybe I gave some interviews which were not really helpful, I have to admit, but I always say what I am feeling and sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's not so positive.\n\n\"That's Oliver Glasner, and in the end, we are in a very good position in the league and now it's up to us with our fans to make a really good season of it.\"\n\nStimac: Palace are my favourites to win the Conference League!\n\nZrinjski Mostar boss Igor Stimac says Crystal Palace are his pick to go on and win the Conference League.\n\n\"Congratulations to Crystal Palace,\" he said.\n\n\"Looking at the teams which are left there. As far as I'm concerned, they are one of the top three favourites in this competition. I wish them the best of luck to win the competition and to go all the way through.\"\n\nQuizzed further on who his top three are, Simac added: \"Crystal Palace is my favourite. Mainz is the second one. I would say we played against them already. And they have an enormous quality in their team also. They have wonderful support and a really, really well-balanced team. Dangerous from each part, each position.\""

            "content": "Celtic salvaged some pride despite exiting the Europa League at the hands of Stuttgart 4-2 on aggregate as Luke McCowan's first-minute strike earned them a first-ever victory in Germany.\n\nTrailing by three goals from the first leg and needing a minor miracle to progress to the last 16, Martin O'Neill decided to rest eight first-teamers against a side fourth in the Bundesliga ahead of a crunch Old Firm game on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.\n\nO'Neill's players did not share his apparent willingness to throw in the towel and stunned the MHPArena with just 28 seconds on the clock as Junior Adamu's slide-rule pass was fired home by McCowan for his first European goal.\n\nCeltic could have had a second when Daizen Maeda got the ball stuck under his feet from an Adamu cross with the home side struggling to settle.\n\nBut once they did settle, there were few signs of an unlikely comeback and stand-in goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo, making his European debut for the Hoops, made a number of saves to keep the visitors ahead on the night.\n\nThe one time the Finnish stopper was beaten by Deniz Undav, VAR intervened to rule Ermedin Demirovic offside in the build-up and keep Celtic's lead alive and avoid a moment of potential controversy for the fourth official, who had let Demirovic back onto the pitch following an injury moments before receiving the ball.\n\nFollowing a first-leg hammering and an equally disappointing home defeat by Hibs at the weekend, Celtic's narrow win provided a tonic for their delighted travelling support as they bowed out of Europe with a victory, and joined Bayern Munich as the only opposition sides to win in Stuttgart so far this season.\n\nO'Neill given 'food for thought' ahead of Old Firm game\n\nO'Neill admitted he was handed some selection dilemmas ahead of Sunday's showdown with Rangers after goalkeeper Sinisalo shone and a much-changed side secured the historic if academic win over Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo made six saves in his sixth Celtic appearance of the season and several of them were impressive stops.\n\nThe 24-year-old Finland international looked assured throughout and put pressure on Kasper Schmeichel for a place at Ibrox after some inconsistent displays from the Dane in recent months.\n\nO'Neill said: \"I thought he did really well, really well, in the game. I'm delighted for him, he's a lovely lad.\n\n\"Everybody did well in the match. It gives me food for thought. Of course it does, absolutely.\n\n\"It's not as if we've played some 16-year-olds. The players have all played, but some have played less football than others in recent times.\n\n\"I thought everybody came out with flying colours.\"\n\nO'Neill admitted McCowan's early strike had him believing they could pull off a famous comeback.\n\nImage: McCowan was all smiles after scoring\n\n\"I'm delighted with the effort and determination they put into the game,\" added the Celtic manager.\n\n\"We got off to a really great start. We felt as if we don't concede in the first 20 minutes of the match, and maybe even nick a goal, we could still be in the tie.\n\n\"I got carried away with myself [after the goal]. I thought, we're going to do this here. Eventually, we have to create more chances and it wasn't to be.\n\n\"It might have been interesting if Seb (Tounekti) had scored towards the last couple of minutes. It might have been a bit nervy for Stuttgart.\n\n\"I genuinely thought we could do it, but I might be asking a lot.\n\n\"We're playing a very, very good side. A side, from my viewpoint here, capable of winning the competition.\n\n\"But I couldn't be more pleased with the team, couldn't be more pleased with attitude and desire.\""

The referee responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and temporarily stopping the match.\n\nUEFA has opened an investigation into allegations of \"discriminatory behaviour\" after the game in Lisbon, and Prestianni was handed a one-match suspension, covering the second leg at the Bernabeu.\n\nBenfica appealed the temporary suspension, and Prestianni did travel and train with the squad in Madrid. However, the appeal was dismissed hours before the game on Wednesday.\n\nReal Madrid won the tie 3-1 on aggregate to seal a spot on the last 16. Aurelien Tchouameni said the result was a \"victory for everyone who stands against racism\".\n\nImage: Gianluca Prestianni arrives in Madrid with the Benfica squad (credit Benfica)\n\nMourinho criticised for response over incident\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho did not speak to the media around Wednesday's second leg, with his sending off during the first leg meaning he did not have to carry out his usual media duties.\n\nIt comes after the former Real Madrid boss was widely criticised for appearing to defend Prestianni and the club by questioning the way Vinicius Jr celebrates goals.\n\n\"I told him, when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. They [Vinicius Jr and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent,\" Mourinho told Amazon Prime following the first leg.\n\n\"When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.\"\n\nImage: Mourinho spoke to Vinicius Jr after the incident in the Champions League knockout round play-off first leg\n\nMourinho then appeared to comment on previous incidents in which Vinicius Jr has been subject to racist abuse in stadiums.\n\nThe Brazilian has spoken out multiple times against racism he has been subject to inside stadiums. In June 2024, three Valencia fans were jailed for eight months for racially abusing him during a LaLiga game the previous year, in the first verdict of its kind in Spain.\n\n\"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,\" said Mourinho. \"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking to a visibly upset Vinicius Jr and a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card during the lengthy stoppage. After a number of discussions between players, coaches and the referee, play then resumed.\n\nReal Madrid held on to win but there was a further short delay late in stoppage time when fans threw objects as Vinicius Jr was attempting to take a corner kick.\n\nImage: Vinicius Junior scored against Benfica in the second leg to round off Real Madrid's win\n\n'Prestianni facing 10-game ban'\n\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\n\nUEFA has moved very quickly to suspend Prestianni. They appointed an ethics inspector last Wednesday to look into allegations that Prestianni had racially abused Vinicius Jr the previous evening.\n\nThe inspector has already spoken to the relevant parties and forwarded an interim report to UEFA's disciplinary body, recommending Prestianni is suspended for one game while the disciplinary process continues.\n\nThe inspector believes there is prima facie evidence that Prestianni has broken UEFA's regulations on discriminatory behaviour, which carries a minimum 10-game ban.\n\nUEFA says the provisional ban is without prejudice, which means Prestianni can still expect a fair hearing.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Aurélien Tchouaméni praised Vinícius Júnior for his performance against Benfica, after the forward was allegedly subjected to racial abuse during the first leg of their Champions League play-off clash.\n\nVinicius Jr: Racists are cowards\n\nPosting after the first leg, in Portuguese on his Instagram story, Vinicius Jr wrote: \"Racists are, above all, cowards.\n\n\"They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.\n\n\"But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened here today was new in my life and my family's.\n\n\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\n\n\"I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\n\nImage: Vinicius Jr spoke to referee Francois Letexier after Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni appeared to make a comment towards him\n\nIn a statement in Portuguese on Instagram, shared by Benfica on social media, Prestianni denied making racist comments.\n\nHe wrote: \"I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard.\n\n\"I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.\"\n\nBenfica posted footage of the incident on X, with the comment: \"As the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.\"\n\nMbappe explains what he heard\n\nReal Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe said in an interview after the match in Lisbon that he heard Prestianni racially abuse his team-mate and said the Benfica winger should not be allowed to play in the Champions League.\n\n\"I know everything,\" the France international said after the game. \"I will explain everything that happened.\n\n\"Vinicius scored a goal - an amazing goal. He goes to dance and the people boo him. That's something that happens in football. After that, there's a moment of tension with the Benfica players. It's better if it doesn't happen, but this can happen too.\n\n\"It's the Champions League, the best competition in the world for clubs. So, it's normal that people want to win, to give their best for their club and their fans and defend their colours.\n\n\"After that, Benfica's No 25 - I don't want to say his name because he doesn't deserve it - starts to talk badly. You don't accept it but, again, it happens in football and it will continue to happen.\n\n\"He put his shirt here [over his mouth] to say Vinicius is a ****** five times. I heard it. There are Benfica players who heard it as well. And after that point, everything you have seen started.\n\n\"I want to try and explain it calmly. I don't want to speak in a general manner. I have come to Portugal many times. I have been lucky to have many team-mates and friends from Portugal, and nothing has ever happened to me.\n\n\"With these kind of things, it's very important to speak in a very clear way, and to not speak in general, because there are people who haven't done anything wrong. In the stadium, I think there are 70,000 people who haven't done anything wrong. They just wanted to support their team.\n\n\"I have the maximum respect for Benfica and their manager, who is one of the best in history, who has made history at Real Madrid.\n\n\"But this player, for me, doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing to play in the Champions League. The best competition. Everyone here, all the journalists, loves the Champions League, no? It inspires me as a player, it inspires the people, it inspires children, and we have to give the best possible example to young people.\n\n\"If we let this kind of thing happen, I think all the values of football are worthless, all that we believe is worthless. We have to do something.\"\n\nVinicius Jr's history with incidents of racism\n\nVinicius Jr has spoken out previously about repeated racist abuse he has suffered, saying in 2024 that he felt \"less and less\" like playing football because of the abuse.\n\nIn that same year, three Valencia fans were sentenced to eight months in prison for racially abusing him at a match in May 2023 - in scenes reminiscent of those in Benfica, as the game was also stopped for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr alerted the referee to fans he felt had abused him.\n\nAfter the game, the Brazilian said LaLiga \"belongs to racism\". But LaLiga president Javier Tebas responded that Vinicius Jr had been \"manipulated\" in calling out the abuse. Tebas later apologised for those comments.\n\nThe three supporters from the Valencia incident were also fined €5,000 (£4,681) and banned from sporting venues for one year for making racist gestures. Valencia were fined €27,000 (£23,581) and had their stadium partially closed for three matches.\n\nSince then, Spain has been punishing supporters for racist abuse towards Vinicius Jr. Four people were convicted for hanging an effigy with his name on it off a highway bridge in Madrid earlier in 2023.\n\nThree of them were sentenced to seven months in prison for hate crimes and threats, while the other was sentenced to 15 months in prison for sharing the images online.\n\nAll four had to take an anti-discrimination training programme to have those sentences suspended, while they were also fined €60,000 and banned from sports venues for two years.\n\nAnd just last year, five Real Valladolid fans were found guilty for racially abusing Vinicius Jr during a match in 2022. They faced one year in prison and were fined up to €1,620 (£1,412) - but again the prison sentences were suspended as long as they did not attend a football match for three years."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three away games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on a direct rival. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in match-day chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) and sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL translators will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday.

Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track following a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croatian’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to firstly avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance.

The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge for the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes following the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, could not take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Strand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThere was a warning for Palace that the tie wasn’t over when Zrinjski had a goal correctly ruled out for offside with 25 minutes still to play. Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 per delegation member has been reduced to $600. One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves at an advantage financially unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s problems is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market. Fifa was contacted for comment."

Green-fingered enthusiasts have their work cut out at this time of year as gardens spring back into action.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIndeed, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) advises pruning roses, planting onion sets and shallots, and, if required, mowing the lawn when it’s dry.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBBC Gardeners' World legend Monty Don agrees that this is the month to do so, though he offers a word of caution. He says the lawn will \"need mowing in March,\" but you shouldn’t \"cut it too short.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn his blog, Monty urged gardeners to \"give it a light trim\" throughout the remainder of the month. Additional advice surfaced on TikTok from Michael Griffiths, who recommended feeding roses to achieve \"better blooms.\"\n\nView 4 Images Gardeners have no shortage of jobs to get stuck into (stock) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, Rob Brett previously emphasised there is \"so much to do\" during the spring months, describing it as a \"great\" opportunity to get planting underway.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRob explained: \"Choosing one thing to plant is a challenge as there is so much to do in a garden in spring. Spring is a great time to plant, so perhaps use early spring to plan your planting sequence. Depending on weather conditions, early March is the last time to plant bare-root trees and shrubs.\n\n\"March is also a great time to split and divide clumps of herbaceous plants and relocate them to areas around the garden (or, if not needed, give them to friends and neighbours).\n\nView 4 Images Rob said summer is a \"great time\" for \"wonderful\" plants like Gladiolus (Image: RHS )\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"March and April are also the time to plant many of our traditional vegetables – early potatoes, onion sets and shallots, for example. If I had to choose one thing to plant in spring it would be summer flowering bulbs. We often neglect to think about this, as we concentrate on planting spring flowering bulbs in autumn.\"\n\nLooking ahead, he observed that summer presents a \"great time\" for \"wonderful\" plants such as Gladiolus, with particular favourites including Nerine and Eucomis, renowned for their \"pineapple flowering heads.\"\n\nBeyond planting, the RHS has outlined a host of additional tasks for gardeners to tackle this March, ranging from planting potatoes to managing overgrown perennials.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nView 4 Images March signals the arrival of spring and offers a welcome reprieve (stock) (Image: Getty Images)\n\nRob wrapped up: \"I would hope that people have been enjoying their gardens throughout the winter – they can become a beautiful visual statement and food for wildlife – but, if you are venturing out for the first time, take stock and see what's looking good, what's flowering and what needs cutting back.\n\n\"March signals a time for cutting back herbaceous plants that have been left over winter, but March is also the time for pruning shrubs and climbing roses.\""

But one best-selling health author has pinpointed the standouts for both men and women, especially when it comes to prioritising hormonal health.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDr Mindy Pelz shared her views during an appearance on The Diary of a CEO podcast with Steve Bartlett. When asked which supplementation she would recommend, the medical professional didn't hesitate.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"For women, the most important supplement she could ever take is magnesium,\" she said. \"Magnesium makes every single hormone in your body.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMagnesium plays a vital role in hundreds of bodily processes. According to the NHS, it helps convert food into energy, supports normal muscle and nerve function, and contributes to healthy bones.\n\nThe National Institute of Health (NIH) reports that magnesium is involved in more than 300 enzymatic reactions, including those that regulate blood pressure and blood sugar levels. Some studies, the NIH notes, suggest the substance may even help with symptoms linked to premenstrual syndrome and sleep quality, although more research is needed.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nFor men, however, Dr Pelz has highlighted a different mineral. \"For men, I would say the most important supplement for hormones, zinc, because zinc makes testosterone,\" she said.\n\nZinc is essential for immune function and cell growth. According to the Office of Dietary Supplements, zinc plays a key role in DNA synthesis and reproductive health, and deficiency has been linked to reduced testosterone levels in men.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nResearch published in the journal Nutrition found that marginal zinc deficiency in older men was associated with significantly lower testosterone concentrations, reinforcing the link between the mineral and male hormonal health. The NHS also states that zinc supports wound healing and helps the immune system fight infection.\n\nExperts stress that while supplements can support health, they are not a replacement for a balanced diet. Official NHS advice for anyone considering new supplements is that they should speak to a GP or pharmacist first, particularly if they have underlying health conditions or take regular medication."

The Acting Returning Officer announced that 36,903 people people voted in the by-election. It means a turnout of 47.62%.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLabour lost the only other Westminster by-election since the 2024 general election, in Runcorn and Helsby, to Nigel Farage's Reform UK last May. Gorton and Denton was seen as a tight race between Reform's Matt Goodwin, Labour and the Greens.\n\nTurnout on Thursday was 47.6%, broadly in line with the 47.8% recorded in 2024.

Voters here report feeling utterly fed up with being bombarded with literature and constant door knocks from all parties. They say they have been under the national microscope for weeks, while local issues are not actually being addressed.\n\nEarlier in the evening a row erupted over claims of family voting at the Gorton and Denton by-election. By-election officials reacted with fury after Democracy Volunteers - an election observer group - said they had seen \"concerningly high levels of family voting\" in the battle.\n\nOfficials said no such issues had been reported throughout the day and questioned why the group had not raised the serious allegations throughout the day. Democracy Volunteers said it had seen family voting in 12% of polling stations.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReform UK member and former Tory Nadhim Zahawi appears to be accepting Reform will lose the by-election, citing the family voting. He said: \"Matt did a brilliant job. We'll probably get 10,000 votes, but the big story is this industrial levels of fraud.\"\n\nBut Manchester City Council responded with fury after claims \"family voting\" was witnessed at polling booths. A spokesperson for the Acting Returning Officer said: \"Polling station staff are trained to look out for any evidence of undue influence on voters. No such issues have been reported today.\n\n\"If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken. We have operated a central by-election hub which was has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police - who had a presence at every polling station - where necessary.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.\""

            "content": "Keir Starmer has suffered a loss to the Green Party at the Gorton and Denton by-election.\n\nIn a major upset for the Prime Minister, Labour slipped into third place after haemorrhaging votes to the Greens and Reform UK.\n\nZack Polanski's party overturned a 13,413 majority won by Labour at the 2024 general election, while Nigel Farage's right-wing outfit also overtook it.\n\nGreen candidate Hannah Spencer won the vote with 14,980 votes. She defeated Labour's Angeliki Stogia, who gained 9,364 votes, and Reform’s Matt Goodwin, who came second with 10,578 votes. The victory marks the Greens' first-ever parliamentary by-election victory.\n\nDropping into third place behind the Greens and Reform marks a seismic moment for Labour. Serious questions over Mr Starmer's leadership are likely to erupt once again after the party lost votes to both the right and to the left.\n\nImage: PA) PA)\n\nLabour chair Anna Turley admitted the result was \"clearly disappointing\" and hit out at \"easy answers\" offered by both the Green Party and Reform UK.\n\nIn her winners speech, Ms Spencer said Gorton and Denton is a \"diverse constituency\" where \"we fight for each other\". She referenced an incident this week at a Manchester mosque in which a man allegedly walked in carrying weapons including a knife and axe and called out \"politicians and divisive figures\" who blame communities for all the problems in society.\n\nMs Spencer, 34, who is a plumber, jokingly apologised to her customers - as she said she'll now be needed in Parliament.\n\nAfter her victory was announced, Labour's Ms Turley said: “This result is clearly disappointing. By-elections are normally difficult for the party of government, and this election was no different. We have had thousands of conversations over the last few weeks and we know the majority of voters here did not want the poisonous politics of Nigel Farage and Reform.\n\n“We will continue to deliver a programme for government that tackles the cost of living crisis families are facing, creates opportunities for young people and invests in our public services. The politics of anger and easy answers offered by the Greens and Reform won’t deliver this.\"\n\nDuring the night, after a Greens win seemed likely, Labour Deputy leader Lucy Powell said her party has to give a clearer account of itself. She said: “People want to hear very loudly and clearly what our story is and whose side we are on, and that is something we will be doing more loudly in the coming weeks.\n\n“It’s our job to convince people that we are doing the right things for the country and that we are improving their lives, and that is the job.”\n\nElsewhere during the night, a row erupted over claims of family voting. Family voting is an illegal practice where two voters either confer, collude or direct each other on voting and can involve husbands telling their wives how to vote.\n\nDemocracy Volunteers - an election observer group - said they had seen \"concerningly high levels of family voting\" in the battle. Officials said no such issues had been reported throughout the day and questioned why the group had not raised the serious allegations throughout the day.\n\nThe by-election was called last month after former Government minister Andrew Gwynne announced he was stepping down. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham attempted to become the Labour candidate, but was blocked from doing so. Instead local councillor Ms Stogia was picked to contest the seat for Labour.\n\nTensions ran high throughout the campaign with Reform and the Greens throwing everything at it to pull off an upset for Labour. Political mud-slinging and accusations of misleading claims ran rife.\n\nLabour branded Mr Goodwin “poisonous” and seized on far-right campaigner Tommy Robinson’s endorsement as a sign of his divisive politics. Labour also sought to draw a dividing line with the Green Party, honing in on its policy to legalise drugs.\n\nThe Greens say a health approach rather than a criminal justice approach should be applied to drugs. But Labour spinners claimed their plans would turn playgrounds into “crack dens”."

            "content": "NHS doctor shares six-month rule that could help protect your child from measles\n\nYou may not realise that you could get your child vaccinated earlier than you thought\n\nView 3 Images A doctor has provided some measles vaccine advice amid an outbreak (Image: Getty)\n\nAn NHS doctor has shared a little-known six-month measles rule that could help protect your child. According to the expert, it is possible to get your baby vaccinated early.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, this only applies in specific circumstances. Measles is a highly contagious infection that can lead to serious complications in certain individuals.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChildren are particularly at risk. Earlier this month, health authorities confirmed a rapidly spreading outbreak across several North London schools, mainly impacting unvaccinated children under 10 years old.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe NHS warns on its website that measles can lead to severe complications if it reaches other areas of the body, especially the lungs or brain. Serious potential complications include pneumonia, meningitis, vision loss, and seizures.\n\nVaccination is the most effective way to protect against measles. Also known as the MMR or MMRV vaccine, it is typically given to children when they are 12 months and 18 months old.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut there are instances in which your child could get their vaccine earlier. In a video uploaded to social media platform TikTok, Doctor Suraj Kukadia explained more.\n\nDr Kukadia, who is better known online as Dr Sooj, said: “The first MMR or MMRV vaccine is given on your child's first birthday. This is on their first birthday or very, very soon after their first birthday.\n\n“MMR stands for ‘mumps, measles and rubella’ and MMRV is for mumps, measles, rubella and varicella, which is the new version of MMR vaccine.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“The vaccination for varicella helps to protect against chickenpox. “ He continued: “But did you know that babies aged between six months and 11 months can have an early dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine?”\n\nHe explained the specific circumstances in which this applies. Dr Sooj said: “But this is only the case if they are travelling to an area where there is a higher risk of catching measles or they've been in contact with someone who has measles, or there's an outbreak of measles, which there is at the moment.\n\n“Now, if you do decide to give your child an MMR or mmrv vaccine early, then they will still need two doses of the vaccine after they turn one and this is how we help to confirm longer term protection.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe also warned that you might not be able to get this early vaccine through the NHS. “You can speak to your GP about this, but there is a chance you'll have to go privately for it because that additional vaccine dose will be outside of the routine immunisation schedule.”\n\nView 3 Images Earlier this month, health authorities confirmed a rapidly spreading outbreak across several North London schools (Image: Getty)\n\nOn the NHS website, it confirms that the vaccine can be given early. It says: “Babies aged six to 11 months can have an early dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine if:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey're travelling abroad to an area where there's a higher risk of catching measles\n\nThey've been in close contact with someone who has measles\n\nThere's an outbreak of measles\n\n“Speak to your GP if you think your baby might need an early dose of the MMRV or MMR vaccine.”\n\nThe rise of measles cases\n\nThe latest figures from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) show there have been 130 laboratory-confirmed measles cases reported in England since 1st January this year. In 2025, there were 959 cases documented, and in 2024, there were 2,911 – the highest annual total since 2012.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBetween 2019 and 2025, there were 20 deaths linked to measles, equalling the number recorded during the 19-year span from 1999 to 2018.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2023, the UK was deemed to have successfully \"eliminated\" measles. The resurgence of infections has been attributed to a substantial decline in vaccination rates.\n\nIn January, the UKHSA stated: \"Uptake of the routine childhood vaccinations is the lowest it has been in a decade and is well below the 95 per cent uptake needed to protect the population and prevent measles outbreaks. This is giving measles a chance to get a foothold in our communities.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images In certain circumstances, your child can have the MMRV vaccine earlier than usual (Image: Getty)\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe NHS says that measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms, followed by a rash a few days later. Some people may also get small spots in their mouth.\n\nThe first symptoms of measles include:\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA high temperature\n\nA runny or blocked nose\n\nSneezing\n\nA cough\n\nRed, sore, watery eyes\n\nCharacteristics of a measles rash:\n\nThe rash starts on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body\n\nThe spots of the measles rash are sometimes raised and join together to form blotchy patches. They're not usually itchy\n\nThe rash looks brown or red on white skin. It may be harder to see on brown and black skin\n\n‌\n\n\n\nYou should ask for an urgent GP appointment or get help from NHS 111 if you think you or your child may have measles. The NHS says: “Measles can spread to others easily. Call your GP surgery before you go in.\n\n“They may suggest talking over the phone or arrange for you to come to a part of the surgery where you’re separated from others.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOther ways to prevent the spread\n\nMeasles is transmitted when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. The infectious period begins when symptoms first appear (approximately four days before the rash emerges) and continues until four days after the rash has developed.\n\nTo limit the spread of the infection, the NHS recommends staying away from school or work for at least four days after the onset of the rash.\n\nGuidance on its website states: \"Stay off nursery, school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears. Also try to avoid close contact with babies and anyone who is pregnant or has a weakened immune system.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAdditional preventative measures recommended by the NHS include:"

Du Toit had also been diagnosed as a psychopath and narcissist, and had confessed to worshipping the devil.\n\nDu Toit demanded control of the vehicle and threatened Botha's life, telling her his name was \"Clinton\". When she told du Toit just to take the car and leave her alone, he told her he “wanted company”.\n\nView 5 Images Both her attackers had previously been convicted of multiple rapes and similarly violent crimes (Image: YouTube )\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCommandeering Botha's car and driving them both around the neighbourhood, du Toit passed his friend and accomplice in his previous convictions, Theuns Krugeras, who was waiting for them by the road. Du Toit slowed the car and let Krugeras get in, telling Botha, “Theuns doesn’t speak good English.”\n\nFrom there, Du Toit drove the three to a quiet, forested nature reserve and stopped the car on a sandy embankment. He dragged Botha from the car and threw her to the ground before brutally raping her.\n\nKrugeras began assaulting her too, but shouted, “No, I can’t do this,” and called out the names “Frans”. Botha, realising \"Clinton\" had been a pseudonym, was determined not to forget this name.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOnce the assault was over, du Toit said to Botha, “If we take you into town now, you’ll go to the police.” He then asked Krugeras, “What do you think Oom Nick would want us to do with her?”\n\nView 5 Images Botha is now a campaigner and hopes her tale will gives other strength (Image: YouTube )\n\n“Oom Nick” is the Afrikaans name for Satan. Krugeras replied: “I think he wants us to kill her.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe pair then callously attacked Botha. Du Toit choked her until she was unconscious, apologising as he carried out his attack.\n\nWhen Botha regained consciousness, she felt a man’s arm around her face and a searing, tugging pain across her neck. Du Toit was slitting her throat. He would make 16 cuts in total, almost ripping Botha’s head from her body.\n\nBotha gruesomely recalled: “I tried to hold my breath, but I realised I had no control over my breathing. I moved my hand to cover my neck [and] my whole hand disappeared into it.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe violence, after a short while, stopped. One of her attackers asked the other if he thought Botha, lying on her stomach on the ground, was still alive. “No one can survive that,” the other responded.\n\nView 5 Images Alison Botha has bravely spoken about her ordeal (Image: YouTube )\n\nThe pair left Botha, still aware of everything happening to her. Remembering the names she had heard, she carved the words “Theuns” and “Frans” into the sandy ground, as well as the words “I love mum”.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe recalls seeing herself from an out-of-body perspective: \"It was as if I'd cut moorings. As I hovered there, I recognised the person down below. I knew it was me, and I felt such a strong connection to that bleeding, mangled girl lying on her stomach.\"\n\nThen, Botha noticed lights in the distance – a nearby road, which was closer than she had originally believed.\n\nRealising this was her chance at survival, she pushed herself to her knees but felt something “tepid, wet and slimy” slide from her stomach.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe looked down and realised her attackers had also slashed her stomach so deeply that her intestines were leaking from her body. “It was horrifying,” she said, “there was just so much of me on the outside. I tried to scoop it all up with my hands but everything just slithered away again.\"\n\nView 5 Images Alison Botha with Tiaan Eilerd, the man who rescued her (Image: Facebook)\n\nNaked, with her half-decapitated head falling almost to her shoulder blades and keeping her intestines barely inside her with a piece of cloth, Botha crawled toward the light.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe waved, and a car thankfully stopped. She heard a woman scream in horror as a young man, Tiaan Eilerd, crouched beside her. Eilerd was a vet and had been on his way home from visiting friends, just as Botha had been just hours before.\n\nUsing his medical knowledge, he checked Botha’s vital signs and helped slow the bleeding. He described Botha as resembling “a creature straight out of a Dickens novel”.\n\nMiraculously, Botha survived. Du Toit and Krugeras were arrested and sentenced to life in prison in 1995, although in 2023, both were released on parole.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThis decision caused such an outcry in South Africa both were rearrested soon afterwards and had their parole revoked, the first time this had happened in the country’s history.\n\nDu Toit complained about Botha choosing not to forgive her attackers and that the ordeal had traumatised him.\n\nBotha, who wrote a memoir and a film about her experience, hoped her story would help inspire others.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"I have always hoped that by sharing my own journey with others, it would give them hope and courage for their own,” she said.\n\n“To have my story and ultimate triumph shared means that so many more people can see the power of choice that we each have; and might also choose to triumph over life's hardships.\""

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "The look was perfect. Emile Heskey wore it so well, that strange cocktail of exasperated indignation. You’re asking me about Erling Haaland? Ah, come on.\n\nHeskey, sat on upholstered leather to bring an air of authority to proceedings – those proceedings being to goad an ex-professional into saying something inflammatory on video for social media, all in the name of betting advertising – briefly weighed up the question of whether Haaland is 'world class'.\n\nHe answered 'no' and then the edited footage cuts to the former Liverpool striker explaining why, presumably to somebody who raised surprise in an action that now had him all of a fluster. ‘World class? Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals. Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals.’\n\nHeskey knows a thing or two about goals of course, having registered one in five games at club level and one in nine for England during a career that saw him clean up at Birmingham City’s Player of the Year Awards in 2005.\n\nThese days he spends a bit of his time flogging CBD online but here we are instead focusing on his suggestion that Haaland is selling snake oil to anybody who thinks he’s an elite striker.\n\nHeskey’s sons, Jaden and Reigan, are both products of Manchester City’s academy and have regularly trained alongside Haaland, so are perhaps in a better position to determine the 25-year-old record-breaker’s skillset from the perspective of somebody who has seen him close up.\n\nErling Haaland chases down the ball against Newcastle last Saturday during a dynamic display in which he had his most touches yet in a Premier League match, at 43\n\nHaaland set up Nico O'Reilly for City's second goal. The Norwegian has three assists since City's formation switch\n\nTheir old man’s game was predicated on doing the donkey work, allowing others to grab headlines. He did this expertly by bringing midfielders into play, occupying defenders, creating channels for others, generally enjoying the physicality of the Premier League.\n\nThat description does bring a man to mind, actually. Long hair, Scandinavian. Fastest ever to 100 Premier League goals. Second in this year’s assist charts with seven, behind only Bruno Fernandes. Part of a leadership team handpicked by the great Pep Guardiola. Seems like a full package. World class, you might say.\n\nDiscussion around what Haaland does or does not do came back round last weekend, when City squeezed past Newcastle United. The best all-round performance of his career has been the shout from a section of observers and Wayne Rooney gushed over the nature of it. ‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ Guardiola said, having already held Haaland up as an example to his team-mates in the dressing room after the 2-1 victory.\n\nBasically the message was to remember what he put in for the cause, the commitment and desire, the sort of which is non-negotiable if City are to beat Arsenal to this title.\n\nHaaland ran, defended, hustled like a man possessed. He bundled Dan Burn about as if the giant defender was a rookie on the slight side. There he was, heading away a dangerous corner in the dying seconds. He didn’t score but assisted beautifully for Nico O’Reilly’s second, standing up a right-foot cross to the back post. Haaland admired it as O’Reilly headed in before darting off to celebrate with the scorer.\n\n‘You can see his joy when other people succeed,’ Norway head coach Stale Solbakken has told Daily Mail Sport. ‘That is big proof of what a team player he is.’ Some City players have been somewhat surprised by his collegiate attitude over the years; that attribute is partly why Guardiola handed him more responsibility last summer.\n\nHis numbers against Newcastle paint a picture. A career-high 12 duels. His most touches in a Premier League match, at 43. No City player completed more clearances, albeit that is dependent on which source and what they determine a clearance to be.\n\nHis average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush, which is a product of Guardiola going with two up front and a box midfield in recent weeks. ‘We’ll see what we do when the wingers (Jeremy Doku and Savinho) are back,’ the City manager said. ‘I think he adapted perfectly. I’m not telling Erling to play left back.’\n\nIt’s no coincidence that Haaland has three assists since the formation switch and is now only one from his league-best tally.\n\n‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ City manager Pep Guardiola said of Haaland's efforts against Newcastle\n\nHaaland's average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush (Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki and Abdukodir Khusanov were all substitutes)\n\nThese bits are significant indicators of a complete centre forward, more Harry Kane than Cristiano Ronaldo. And it is a trend. The conversations around how Haaland’s game has been transformed, doing more for the team and not ‘just’ scoring an inordinate number of goals, have now surfaced at least four times this season.\n\nThe draw at Arsenal. Beating United in September’s derby – before which Haaland was a central figure in a team meeting about raising standards and when he completed more defensive actions than that Newcastle match. And after a home win against Bournemouth. Each display prompted discourse about his style, the sort of which that has that guy at the end of the bar earnestly offering that Haaland’s not just about goals anymore, you know.\n\nThat this talk about an improvement outside of his recognised zone, between the posts, happens periodically and presented as new begs the question: has he actually always been like this?\n\nThe answer is yes and no, although it certainly looks to the naked eye that he has grown into a main character of City’s build-up play. And often that is more instructive than the raw stats. Heading and City relying upon his size is the main upturn – and a drastic one. This has been an area that Haaland’s worked on for a long while, particularly with Marco Rose at Borussia Dortmund, and one he knew needed elevating.\n\nWhile the number of aerial duels he battles in is only up marginally per 90 minutes, 3.9 now compared to 3.55 last year and 3.2 during his first season, City are seeing far better results. Haaland now wins 64 per cent of those, up from an average of around 50.\n\nHis dribbling statistics are on an upward curve, one deft slalom against Newcastle given the slow-motion treatment by City’s video team this week. He takes on more of those per game and completes 40 per cent.\n\nBut then there are the others. Winning back possession in the final third is better than last year but not as prevalent as in 2023-24. Passes played into the box is half of the Treble year. Expected assists are broadly the same as his other three campaigns, chances created from open play are actually lower than ever - even if through-balls are now far higher than his normal average.\n\nAverage number of touches – the metric that detractors became obsessed by – are lower than his first two seasons, 24 now and 27 in that blistering first term when plenty mocked his lack of general involvement. But this takes into account the whole season, not just the period that City have been wingerless. Anyway, it's a funny old game. He’d not felt the ball once before a 15th-minute opener in Monaco and nobody mentioned it.\n\nHaaland is now winning far more of his aerial duels: 64 per cent up from an average of around 50\n\nHaaland's stats for winning back possession in the final third are better than last year\n\nOften the sheer weight of goals distract from everything else and perhaps the amazement of those feats wearing off has seen pundits look for other things in his game to highlight.\n\nCertainly working for the team is nothing new, Haaland particularly pleased with a decoy run to distract Juan Foyth, allowing Bernardo Silva to score, away at Villarreal in October as a recent example, even if dropping deep is.\n\nRoughing up William Saliba and Gabriel in the 2023 title showdown with Arsenal is a memorable display of force and doing the dirty stuff, while Norway marvelled at the way he pressed, ran channels and held up possession as they secured a vital World Cup qualification win over Italy in June.\n\nTactically, they are seeing him have a greater awareness of what is required, especially against supposedly superior opposition. And that is maybe where this year’s difference comes: the statistics are similar but it’s learning how best to utilise those opportunities to the betterment of players around him.\n\nEven as the league’s top scorer on 22, there have been struggles. A barren spell in front of goal either side of new year is being worked through and he is still not entirely out of that yet. Coming out of the dressing room at Anfield in his sliders, Haaland insisted there was ‘no excuse’ for his form and he has still only scored one from open play in his last 10 league games.\n\nHe has refused to put this down to fatigue, even if Guardiola has labelled him ‘exhausted’ and attempted to give rest where possible, Haaland benched for victory over Wolves last month. Haaland is between houses at the moment, the family temporarily moving down near Crewe, and spent some of his three days off after Newcastle in Paris.\n\nLeeds United next, the city of his birth, as the first half of the run-in starts motoring. City undoubtedly need him to start scoring regularly now and Guardiola has spoken candidly about the pressures the club’s No 9 places upon himself.\n\nHaaland celebrates scoring against Fulham with Phil Foden but he only has one goal from open play in his last 10 league games\n\n'The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola says. ‘We won the Treble because he scored I don’t know how many goals'\n\n‘The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola said. ‘That is the challenge for him. When your expectation is five goals a season, you can improve. We won the Treble because he arrived, he scored I don’t know how many goals (52), and the expectations are there.\n\n‘When you go four or five games without scoring, it is like “Oh what happened, what happened?” He puts a lot of responsibility on himself. He is a guy who desperately wants to help the team and the club. I always say to him not to put too much pressure (on himself).\n\n‘He knows how much we need him, he doesn’t want to leave the team disappointed. That is a big attribute. I would prefer that to somebody who doesn’t care. He’s completely the opposite, he suffers when he doesn’t score a goal. Don’t suffer, you do your best.’\n\nThe best will never be enough for some."

The BBC broadcasts of the Games had 26.3million viewers in all.\n\nIt’s not the only time lately when that experience of tuning in to something transcending clicks and instant gratification was to be found on the BBC. Against a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January.\n\nThe ensuing digital clips were fine – bandaged captain Paul Dawson leaping to score and sending the roof off that modest stadium – but it was the unfolding match, the national suspense, the collective willing-on of the underdogs, the excellent Mark Chapman’s half-time talk with the Macclesfield manager’s brother, Wayne Rooney – which made it so fine and compelling.\n\nSport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities. Sport as we had once come to expect it from the broadcaster which takes our licence fee.\n\nThe BBC's Winter Olympics coverage showed sport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities... not merely social media clips\n\nAgainst a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January\n\nThe media landscape is changing at a mesmerising pace. The BBC, in the throes of existential crisis, are facing the financial challenge of streaming platforms which are making the commercial battle for live sport extremely competitive.\n\nBut it was not just those of us brought up on the live football commentary of John Motson, Barry Davies and the great Hugh Johns whose hearts were heavy when hearing the BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski tell the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant.\n\n‘We’re not competing against who we were competing with before,’ he said. ‘The BBC might have thought, traditionally, it was up against ITV, or Sky, or other broadcasters. Well, guess what? We’re not. We’re in a race to not be swiped. Up against people selling you holidays, or clothes companies, or two-for-one chicken breasts on sale from the supermarket, or football teams, or athletes.\n\n‘We still have reporting and live pages and digital video that draw in millions and millions and millions of people. You can still be relevant - you can still matter - if you don’t show the sport.’\n\nBBC Sport’s need for intellectual curiosity and imagination in a complicated media landscape extending far beyond outside broadcasts is undeniable. All in the industry are facing the same challenge. Clips are certainly working for them in terms of Premier League, Champions League and cricket coverage.\n\nBut it was what Kay-Jelski didn’t say, as well as his bleak and provocative suggestion that the BBC’s sports output is competing with poultry purveyors, which reinforced the sense that the national broadcaster have given up on live sport, in their pursuit of digital clicks.\n\nWhat you really wanted to hear was that BBC Sport are fighting for their lives to hold on to the rights of sports held dearest by the British public, in the face of aggressive streamers who want to monetise them. That the list of televised sport's free-to-air ‘crown jewels’ must, as a matter of national significance, be extended to preserve them for those who cannot or will not pay for an ever-growing number of commercial bolt-ons.\n\nA group of MPs have let it be known that they are supportive of such an extension. Here was some momentum to seize on. On all of the above, we heard nothing.\n\nThe BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski told the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant\n\nSome broadcast staff in the BBC’s Six Nations coverage, already split with ITV, are thought to be wondering how secure the future looks. Wimbledon five years from now? Who knows?\n\nThe Boat Race is the most recent live sport event lost from the BBC, with word coming down last autumn that the corporation had ‘fallen out of love’ with it. Granted, not an event guaranteed to feed the clips or ‘second screen’ culture. But one which is still held in huge national affection, with a 2.6million viewership.\n\nThe event, enthusiastically picked up by Channel 4, has now gone the same way as the Grand National, The Open, Test cricket, the Paralympics and Royal Ascot. Each of those pillars of British sport came with the licence fee in the early 1990s. No more.\n\nThis summer will see the Commonwealth Games not staged on the BBC for the first time – a disaster for organisers involved in their own fight for relevance. The Games have been picked up by TNT Sports.\n\nThat’s the same broadcaster whose low-rent coverage of the Ashes this winter was encapsulated by commentator Rob Hatch mistaking a replay of Jamie Smith's run-out as a live wicket and excitedly announcing that Ben Stokes had been dismissed.\n\nIn December, my colleague Mike Keegan’s reporting provided a graphic sense of how the BBC’s pivot to digital content, and the 16-24-year-old demographic it craves, is being viewed by staffers who believe in the concept of covering sports news on TV. His report related how a Q&A session with senior management, called a ‘culture cafe’ became a ‘slanging match’ at times.\n\nIt also highlighted how, in the same pursuit of the digital traffic, BBC Sport have recruited dedicated correspondents for Liverpool, Newcastle United, Chelsea and the Manchester clubs, as well as a ‘football tactics correspondent’ and a ‘football issues correspondent'. Chasing online audiences which the nation’s big clubs bring does not cohere with a Royal Charter which that states the BBC should be for everyone.\n\nKay-Jelski’s words this week suggested that he is fine with facing down the criticism. ‘It’s OK if a lot of these innovations don’t make everybody happy,’ he said. ‘It’s also OK if some of the traditional forms of its media content or sporting content don’t make people happy.’\n\nHow long before Wimbledon joins Sue Barker in departing our free-to-air screens?\n\nBut for two weeks this month, we were reminded that linear TV is not dead, as we sat together in front of the box in the corner of the room and watched skiers and snowboarders and skaters fly in northern Italy.\n\nWe witnessed the extraordinary outcome when BBC Sport commentators, editors, engineers and studio staff cohere. We were reminded of the understated brilliance of Hazel Irvine, one of the nation’s very best sports presenters.\n\nAnd it was all ours to view, for free. The very best of our licence fee.\n\n\n\nMy friend bought his young kids a carpet curling kit and says they were so besotted that they practised every day of the Games. Such is the wonder and absorption that live sport brings. You don’t fall in love with clips."

            "content": "Earlier this week, before his devastating hundred hurtled England into the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, Harry Brook sauntered into a press conference, clocked the facial expressions of those present and suggested a smile or two wouldn’t go amiss.\n\nNaturally, there have been times during what has been the most harrowing of winters for Brook that facing questions from the media was the last thing he wanted to do. But the jovial nature of that entrance in Pallekele here in Sri Lanka told of his desire to move on and embrace the next chapter of his England captaincy.\n\nThere is no doubt that he is in a much happier place since this World Cup began, despite the revelations on its eve that he lied about being alone on the Halloween night out that ended with him being struck by a Wellington bouncer.\n\nThere is an irony here, because without the Yorkshireman’s honest testimony - coming clean to England coach Brendon McCullum during the final one-day international at Wellington's Sky Stadium on November 1 - there is a chance the episode might never have come out.\n\nFor the original story entered the public domain during England’s Ashes tour not because of the incident itself, but the fact he’d been reprimanded and fined £30,000 by his ECB bosses as a result. Equally, it was loyalty to team-mates Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue that led Brook, in taking responsibility and apologising for his own actions, to say that he had been on his own.\n\nNot great optics, some will argue, and it led to further scrutiny from the outside world in the form of an ongoing investigation by the Cricket Regulator. But it has arguably strengthened Brook’s standing within the England dressing room - other players respect him. And they are increasingly his players.\n\nHarry Brook's attempts to protect his team-mates have strengthened his standing within the England dressing room\n\nBrook points to the heavens in memory of his grandmother Pauline after reaching his 50-ball hundred in Pallekele on Tuesday\n\nOver the course of his 10-month tenure, Brook’s influence on selection has shown itself with the recalls of Will Jacks and Tom Banton, two of his former England Under 19s team-mates, even if another close friend in Brydon Carse has fallen by the wayside.\n\nJacks has found himself in a new role at No 7, while Brook confessed at the start of this tournament that he did not necessarily have a specific position for Banton, just that he knew he wanted him in his first-choice XI. Liam Dawson was recalled from the international wilderness at the start of last summer. Surrounding himself with old friends, people with whom he shares mutual trust, has had the desired effect on and off the field.\n\nA strong bond has developed with Bethell, the team’s unofficial vice-captain and whose adventurous nature led to walks together through leafy Kandy, seeking out the best coffee shops.\n\nAway from the game, Brook lost his grandmother Pauline - whom he called his ‘rock’ - two years ago this month. She was someone who in typical Yorkshire style told him how things were. Berated him for bad shots. Or poor choices. Loved him unconditionally. Poignantly, he looked to the heavens in her memory when he reached three figures in Pallekele.\n\nGuidance more recently has come from his manager Phil Weston, the former Worcestershire and Gloucestershire player, whom he acknowledged has been an ‘amazing’ support as trouble shadowed him these past few months.\n\nBrook’s mum, Lucy, has been around too and was present for his 27th birthday last Sunday, including a 'cake smash' after victory over the tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, in which Bethell appeared to take great delight in the smearing of sponge and cream into the England captain’s face.\n\nThat took place at the team hotel in Kandy where two nights later in the bar, a posse of England players, mingling happily with fans, raised glasses to the 100 that had downed Pakistan by two wickets - booking the first ticket to the final four in the process.\n\nThere is a time and a place for such things, of course, and no one would be so prudish as to deny them a chance to celebrate success three nights before what is for England a dead-rubber against New Zealand on Friday.\n\nEngland are operating to a self-imposed curfew of midnight on non-matchdays during this tournament, but there has been no need for an alcohol ban, just a much more mature approach to its consumption in the light of an Ashes dogged by forensic examination of boozy incidents.\n\nBrook smashes a straight six on the way to his 50-ball century against Pakistan\n\nWill Jacks congratulates Brook on his ton. Brook wanted Jacks in the team and the all-rounder's presence is a sign of the captain's growing influence on selection\n\nFor one, there is not much opportunity for nights out in a World Cup schedule that has generally been travel, practice, play, repeat. Although they did stop off in Colombo in transit from Kolkata to Kandy last week, allowing a group of 20 and 30-somethings to act like 20s and 30-something men and enjoy some downtime.\n\nGolf and padel have been on the agenda, but watching Brook’s mastery of the Pakistan bowling attack on Tuesday was a reminder that to him cricket always comes first.\n\nMultiple publishers were interested in Brook writing a book this winter, charting a rise from West Yorkshire village club Burley-in-Wharfedale to a Test batsman averaging mid-50s, but he postponed it, citing a desire to retain full focus on England’s tour Down Under.\n\nSince resuming his limited-overs captaincy, he has orchestrated five wins out of six in bilateral matches here in Sri Lanka - using the defence of just 128 in the final T20 as a reference point during team meetings for maintaining a never-say-die-attitude at this tournament.\n\nImprovements have been noticeable both in terms of tactics and temperament: an instinct call to open the bowling with Jacks despite a competition economy rate touching 14 rushed the Sri Lankans to Super Eight defeat last weekend, while slowing his bowlers down between deliveries to regain composure proved a crucial factor in the last-ball thriller versus Nepal. Pre-match chats have not altered, with input from Brook and Brendon McCullum bookending thoughts from the floor.\n\nBut several members of the squad have reflected on the increasingly symbiotic relationship of Brook and McCullum, which would bode well for the future if the New Zealander were secure in his position.\n\nHowever, the threat of post-Ashes change coincides with Ben Stokes being assigned a ‘coaching’ role with England Lions in the UAE, effectively increasing contact time with Andrew Flintoff following their partnership at Northern Superchargers last August. Such arrangements might just be coincidence, of course.\n\nBrook calls McCullum the best coach he’s known, and immediately credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy the Pakistan attack.\n\nBrook calls England coach Brendon McCullum the best he’s known and credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy Pakistan\n\nLike Ben Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect on Brook\n\nThose close to him joke that Brook wears his intelligence lightly - Joe Root playfully dubbed him an 'idiot' last year. Yet his cricketing smarts are there for all to see.\n\nTake that 50-ball hundred when in conjunction with Sam Curran and Jacks - fellow gym bunnies - the Pakistanis were run ragged on Pallekele’s huge expanses, conceding nine twos in addition to Brook’s 14 boundaries. He later joked that his 2023 self would have carried too much timber to have seen through the plan.\n\nLike Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect, even if there are blips - like the too-close-to-the-bone Stone Cold Steve Austin beer slam celebration marking his one-day hundred here in Colombo last month.\n\nThe thousands of supporters that flocked to Australia did so in the hope of witnessing such hundreds there, not brain fades that gifted his wicket away.\n\nBut hope remains that his first truly match-defining international innings can raise smiles until what is the very latest point on England’s winter schedule - the final in Ahmedabad a week on Saturday - seeing him emulate Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler as World Cup-winning captains."

            "content": "Arsenal have picked up an unhealthy habit in 2026. Self-destruction.\n\nIf that seems a little harsh on a team currently five points clear at the top of the Premier League, consider that they are second in another table.\n\nOnly rivals Tottenham have conceded more goals from errors this calendar year (five to Arsenal's four), with a streak of costly lapses threatening to undermine the Gunners' momentum.\n\nHad it not been for the emphatic 4–1 scoreline against Spurs last weekend, this dangerous pattern might already have been laid bare. Instead, the winning margin that day masked an issue which has been lingering in the background.\n\nOn Sunday, Declan Rice was the culprit, uncharacteristically giving the ball away to Randal Kolo Muani outside of the area, ahead of the Frenchman's equaliser.\n\nComing from a man who has been so dependable for Arsenal all season long, the error felt significant.\n\nArsenal players have made four errors leading to goals in 2026, with Declan Rice (left) at fault for Tottenham's equaliser on Sunday\n\nIt's a problem Mikel Arteta needs to solve soon, with the title race decided by such fine margins\n\nPlayers are human, of course. Mistakes can happen. But when it becomes concerning is when a trend emerges.\n\nBetween their opening match of the season against Manchester United on August 17 and December 31, the Gunners made just one mistake that directly led to a goal — the fewest across the league, and a testament to their brilliant defensive record.\n\nThat error came when Martin Zubimendi was tackled in the build-up to Richarlison’s consolation goal against Spurs in November.\n\nIt was an isolated lapse, and the big question at the time was whether Arsenal could break Chelsea’s 2004-05 record of conceding just 15 goals in a single campaign. But since the turn of the year, cracks have begun to show.\n\nRice’s misstep was merely the latest in a sequence of self-inflicted wounds: against Bournemouth, Gabriel’s defensive lapse was ruthlessly punished by Evanilson; versus Manchester United, Zubimendi was caught out and Bryan Mbeumo capitalised.\n\nAnd in the meeting with Wolves, confusion between Gabriel and David Raya in the area allowed Tom Edozie to convert a stoppage-time equaliser, with his strike rebounding off Riccardo Calafiori and into the net.\n\nTo make matters worse, title rivals Manchester City are yet to concede a single goal due to an individual error in 2026. The contrast couldn't be starker.\n\nThe margins are razor-thin at the top, yet the Gunners are being hurt by their own avoidable mistakes.\n\nThese are not systemic defensive collapses, nor tactical breakdowns. They are concentration lapses, moments that elite sides simply cannot afford, and point towards a psychological battle amid the rising pressure of trying to win the club's first Premier League title in over 20 years.\n\nMartin Zubimendi feels the heat after gifting Manchester United a goal at the Emirates last month. Arsenal went on to lose the game 3-2\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh earned 20 caps for Northern Ireland and played for Tottenham and Norwich.\n\nHaving seen both sides of the equation, he is clear on how pressure will be affecting the Arsenal players’ mental psyche.\n\nMcVeigh told Daily Mail Sport: ‘When players are in the zone, they call it being in a flow state. This is when players perform at their best because they're not thinking about it. It allows the muscles in their frame for years and years to be able to perform and not even think about it.\n\n‘But once players are aware (of the pressure), it becomes more and more important. And of course, it's very difficult to stop thinking about it now that you're in the zone.\n\n‘This group of players (at Arsenal) have come close and fallen away quite a lot of times over the last few years, so it is very difficult to stay in the subconscious.\n\n‘The players who have won league titles, like the Manchester City players, who have done it a number of times over the last five years, they have the experience of getting over the line.\n\n‘So they might have different strategies they can use. The majority of the Arsenal team, however, don’t know how to navigate the situation of being in a title race, and the Arsenal fans are expecting them to throw it away.’\n\nThe culprits of these errors are seasoned players at the top of their games, the mistakes coinciding with a tide of expectation which has continued to build from the outside.\n\nThat his given opposition teams, even as lowly as Wolves, a glimmer of hope in matches which Arsenal fail to kill off.\n\nMikel Arteta’s men are no longer suffocating games once they gain control. Instead, they are offering opponents moments, small windows that top-flight forwards can exploit.\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh played over 200 games for Norwich. He insists Arsenal's near-misses in previous Premier League seasons will have taken a toll\n\nA loose pass in midfield or a split-second of indecision at the back each carries amplified consequence in a title race defined by the smallest of details.\n\nIt is this slight vulnerability which has prevented the north London club being at least eight points clear at the top — had they beaten Wolves and drawn with Manchester United — instead of just five. In that scenario, the title race would have felt an awful lot more settled than it does now.\n\nMcVeigh, who wrote a book titled It’s Not About You: The Psychology of Leadership featuring an interview with Robert Pires, played against the 2004 Invincibles side when he was at Norwich. That team is incomparable to the current Arsenal side in his eyes.\n\n‘I don't think there's any comparison at all,’ he explained. ‘The team I played against were almost superhuman.\n\n‘When I was playing (against them), not only did Thierry Henry not have to run with the ball at his feet, he was walking with it, as if to say, “Don't come near me because if you do, I'm going to embarrass you”.\n\n‘And so I took him at his word and I didn't go near him, I kept backing off. The difference is, there was a supreme confidence and inner belief that team, especially personified by Thierry Henry, were going to win.\n\n‘By that stage, Henry, Patrick Vieira, Pires, all these guys were World Cup winners, absolute serial winners, and they were all coming together with another group of players in that team who had all won significant prizes. That is the massive difference.’\n\nA stoppage-time mix-up between Gabriel and David Raya at Wolves last week saw the Gunners drop two points to the league's bottom side\n\nThe good news for Arteta is that the issue can be fixed. In terms of what Arsenal can do to cope with pressure and iron out mistakes, McVeigh added: ‘They could be doing things like visualisation, affirmations, setting goals, psycholinguistics, working as a group and having discussions on all of this. There's so many different things.\n\n‘Whether players are actually good at this, working on their psychology, I would highly doubt. In my 30 years in professional football, I would say less than one per cent of people in professional football utilised sports psychology, which for me is just an absolute crutch.\n\n‘They (Arsenal) have sports psychologists. The difference is, does anyone actually use them? That's always the question: how much trust does a player have in a psychologist that the club provides? Potentially, the player might doubt that there's going to be complete trust between them and the psychologist.\n\n‘The psychologist could be having conversations with the manager, which is always the difference. It is why, even as a player, you might struggle a little bit (to trust them).’\n\nDespite some of the recent errors, it is not as though Arsenal’s defence is meek or weak. From August through December, their remarkable solidity was the backbone of their good form, with their backline the envy of Europe.\n\nA fearsome centre-back partnership of Gabriel and William Saliba, aided by defensively sound full backs in the shape of Jurrien Timber and either Calafiori or Piero Hincapie, is a mean defence on paper.\n\nWhen asked about why his team were conceding such few goals earlier in the season, Arteta replied: ‘The right level of organisation, but especially with the desire to play, shown every day, and the commitment that they show to do all the duties necessary for us to be a team that is very difficult to play against and to score against.’\n\nHe views defending as an element the whole team has to buy into, a non-negotiable even.\n\nDefending is something Arteta wants his whole team to buy into. Will his side be able to restore their superb record before the season is out?\n\nSince January, that sharpness has dulled just enough to tilt tight contests in the wrong direction. Arsenal have conceded eight goals across nine league games in 2026. Before the turn of the year, it was 13 conceded across 19 games.\n\nThe nine-match sample so far this year includes conceding two goals each against bottom-placed Wolves and mid-table Bournemouth, as well as shipping three at home to United. Clean sheets have given way to recovery jobs, and authority has been replaced by anxiety.\n\nThe data shows a rise in goals conceded, but the eye test reveals hesitation where there was once conviction. And at this level, hesitation is costly.\n\nIf Arsenal are to go the distance, the mistakes must stop — and immediately."

            "content": "Sheffield Wednesday... here is why Mike Ashley is NOT the worst owner to steer the ship while in severe peril, writes CRAIG HOPE\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nMike Ashley is not the worst owner. Now there is a statement that would have once raised eyebrows, if not fists, on Tyneside.\n\nA black and white might have left you black and blue for daring to be so antagonistic. Yet, for Sheffield Wednesday, there is a grain of hope in that thought.\n\nFor Ashley to make a success of any investment — you can measure that in pounds and pence — his football club needs to function, albeit dysfunctionally. It is not in the interest of him nor the brands whose colours will soil the club for it to drop down the pyramid and be run into the ground.\n\nThink of the two seasons when he showed most interest and ambition at Newcastle — they were both in the Championship. The first time, in 2009/10, he funded the pay packets of Nicky Butt, Alan Smith, Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and Andy Carroll and his team amassed 102 points as champions. Seven years later and the stardust was in the dugout in the form of Rafa Benitez. Again, they won the league. Not every club relegated from the Premier League has an owner so desperate to take them back to the top flight, even if the motivation was self-interest. Once back in the top flight, however, the aspiration did not extend far beyond keeping the billboard prominent.\n\nIf Ashley is to get involved with Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure. That, for them, is no bad thing given their current plight. Supporters might have to hold their nose — and close their eyes to avoid the red and blue — but Ashley’s scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his primary goal.\n\nHis attitude to football changed the day his family were verbally abused when Newcastle were relegated at Villa Park in 2009, two years after he had bought the club. As one source told us when Ashley finally sold Newcastle to a Saudi-backed consortium in 2021: ‘The club became about maximising brand exposure for Sports Direct at the expense of on-field ambition. He had an attitude of, “All noise is good noise”.\n\nIf Mike Ashley (left) is to get involved with Sheffield Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure\n\nAshley scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his main goal\n\n‘A lot of the stunts he pulled were exactly that — renaming the stadium, branding all over the ground, he knew the publicity it would generate.\n\n‘If the team did well at the same time then great, but he wasn’t going to invest his own money chasing the top four, the margins didn’t add up. Instead, it was about making the club self-sufficient, making a profit on player sales and staying in the Premier League to keep Sports Direct prominent.’\n\nAshley likes distressed assets and will sense an opportunity at Hillsborough. Not to be the altruistic white knight, more so the dark horse with cold-eyed intent. But when the starting line is League One and the threat of extinction, the 61-year-old is not necessarily a bad bet. He has ridden a similar track before, given the big-club heritage of Newcastle, iconic home and invested fanbase. He will know some of the shortcuts to accelerate the journey.\n\nAs for the destination, the comfort for supporters is that it should be a better place than where they find themselves.\n\nAshley does not want to see a team bounce around League One. The detail might well be in the retail, but that is the price on the ticket if he is to swoop in and rescue the club. He would certainly generate interest.\n\n\n\nHere is one story that captures the maverick of the man. During a meeting with Sports Direct senior managers, he gave them all a playing card. Ashley had a deck and started turning over cards from the top. The first to match was a store boss from Teesside, and Ashley gave him the keys to a new Ferrari Spider. It is rarely dull around Ashley. Buckle up, Sheffield Wednesday."

            "content": "Ruben Amorim and his coaching staff could receive a staggering £15.9million in compensation from Manchester United after they were sacked last month.\n\nAmorim, 41, was axed by United on January 5 after just 14 months in charge at Old Trafford, with his five coaches also departing the club.\n\nDaily Mail Sport revealed he walked away with a £10m pay-off after he was summoned to the club's Carrington training base and dismissed by director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada.\n\nA filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday revealed removing Amorim and his coaches could cost up to £15.9m.\n\nThe figure stated in the submission is a maximum number, with the exact amount to be determined by factors including whether Amorim lands another job within a certain timeframe.\n\nAmorim's compensation package took the total cost of hiring and firing him to nearly £27m.\n\nRuben Amorim and his coaching staff could net nearly £16m in compensation from United\n\nUnited have spent nearly £30million on the sacking of two managers and one executive in just 15 months\n\nUnited bought out his contract at Sporting Lisbon in October 2024 for £8.3m, and paid another £900,000 so he could start work early. He signed a £6.5m-a-year deal until June 2027, meaning his pay-off for the remainder of his contract is around £10.05m.\n\nThe club had already splashed out £14.5m following the sacking of Erik ten Hag and departure of sporting director Dan Ashworth.\n\nShould they be forced to compensate Amorim and his staff in full, it will take the total United have spent on sacking managers and executives to nearly £30m in just 15 months.\n\nAmorim left United the day after an explosive press conference following the 1-1 draw with Leeds, where he openly criticised club bosses. He clashed with Wilcox in a meeting three days before the trip to Elland Road.\n\nUnited took the decision amid concerns the team could fail to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nAmorim was replaced on an interim basis by Darren Fletcher before the club appointed Michael Carrick, who has won five and drawn one of his six games in charge to boost United's chances of returning to European football's top table.\n\nThe Red Devils are fourth having won the most points - 18 - of any Premier League team this calendar year.\n\nThe top five in the Premier League will secure a Champions League place next season and United are three points clear of Liverpool in sixth.\n\nAmorim won only 25 of his 63 games in charge and finished 15th in the Premier League before losing the Europa League final to Tottenham in May."

            "content": "Crystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar: Oliver Glasner finally finds the formula in Europe with key tactical change - as Eagles unite Selhurst Park despite chaos engulfing the club\n\nRight when they needed them, Crystal Palace's players stepped up as Oliver Glasner's side kept their European dream alive on a huge night at Selhurst Park.\n\nMaxence Lacroix’s first-half header looked to have been decisive for Palace, but after some nervy moments, Evann Guessand confirmed the victory in injury-time to knock out their plucky Bosnian opponents Zrinjski Mostar.\n\n'It was a good and important win,' Glasner said post-match. 'We learned the lessons from the away leg, controlled the game and waited for the moments.\n\n'Not everything is perfect, but we can see the players are feeling better in the way we are playing.'\n\nThere was no doubt this was the biggest night of the Eagles' season given the way their campaign has started to unravel since Glasner announced in January that he would be leaving this summer.\n\n2025-26 had promised so much, but an end to the European journey in February, regardless of the acrimony that has followed the Austrian in recent weeks, would’ve been a disaster.\n\nCrystal Palace dispatched Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to reach the UEFA Conference League last 16\n\nEvann Guessand's 93rd-minute strike followed Maxence Lacroix's first-half header\n\nIt is easy to forget that it is just over two months since Palace, not long off a club record unbeaten run, were in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and about to enter the FA Cup as holders, but such has been the collapse in their form that this felt enormous.\n\nThat jeopardy was added to by Zrinjski manager Igor Stimac, once of West Ham and Derby.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference, he called out Palace's board for a 'lack of ambition', spoke about their weaknesses, and expressed a desire to add to his own history against the club. Stimac was at Derby when they beat the Eagles to gain promotion to the Premier League in 1996.\n\nYet despite the recent chaos that has engulfed Palace and the breakdown in relationship between the fans and Glasner as a result of his repeated public outbursts, the home supporters roared their side on from before kick-off and this was a night where harmony returned to Selhurst Park.\n\n'I'm always honest,' the Austrian added when pressed on his recent words. 'I can’t do it differently.\n\n'If I feel something I say it and then I have to take the s***storm that follows. Hopefully everybody knows what I'm saying is for the success of Crystal Palace. Tonight the support was great.'\n\nPalace had won just two of their last 16 matches in all competitions heading into this clash - including a dire performance in last week's 1-1 draw in Bosnia - yet the energy and intensity that had been lacking during that run was back in the first half.\n\nMuch of their European campaign has been hampered by a failure to break down low blocks, but here they zipped the ball around and pressed with intent.\n\nIt was also notable how much more direct they were in their play and Jorgen Strand Larsen, Daichi Kamada and Guessand all went close early on.\n\nZrinjski were dogged, and Stimac’s side used all the tricks they could to slow Palace down and frustrate them.\n\nCrystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar (3-1 aggregate) Crystal Palace (3-4-2-1): Henderson (C) 7; Richards 7.5, Lacroix 8, Canvot 7.5; Munoz 7, Wharton 7.5 (Hughes 56 7), Kamada 7.5, Mitchell 7; Sarr 7, Guessand 8; Strand Larsen 7 (Johnson 73 6) Subs not used: Benitez (GK), Matthews (GK), Clyne, Sosa, Devenny, Rodney, Riad, Pino, Cardines Manager: Oliver Glasner 7 Yellow cards: Canvot, Strand Larsen, Wharton Goals: Lacroix 36, Guessand 90+3 Referee: Luis Godinho 5\n\nYet it was Adam Wharton, one of many players to have struggled during the recent run, who whipped in a delightful free kick for Lacroix, the unsung hero of this side, to head home powerfully.\n\nThe atmosphere ramped up a notch and the question was whether the Eagles could capitalise, but Glasner’s side squandered a host of opportunities and the tension ramped up.\n\nIt almost cost them when Tomi Juric agonisingly headed wide for Zrinjski in injury time, although that left the stage for Guessand to settle things after good link-up play with Brennan Johnson as Palace secured their passage to the last-16.\n\n\n\n'Crystal Palace deserved to go through,' Stimac said. 'They played better football in both games.'"

            "content": "Vitor Pereira's honeymoon period as Nottingham Forest head coach has lasted precisely 225 minutes. That was all it took for the home fans to show their disgust with their team.\n\nThey may have squeezed through to the Europa League last 16 but in Pereira's third game at the helm, Forest were far from convincing and were booed off at half-time, trailing to Kerem Akturkoglu's strike.\n\n'I took a risk,' admitted Pereira. 'I had to pick this game with one eye on our game at Brighton on Sunday. It's not easy to make six changes but I could not think only about this game. We are not comfortable in the Premier League and it's very important to get points so we can avoid a difficult situation.'\n\nIt threatened to become worse when Akturkoglu converted a penalty early in the second half but by then Pereira had sent on his main men and one of them, Callum Hudson-Odoi, scored in the 68th minute to seal a 4-2 aggregate victory. Forest will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland in the next round – even though they took on both clubs in the league phase.\n\nThanks to their 3-0 first-leg win in Istanbul last week, this should have been a comfortable evening for Forest. But like Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche before him, Pereira is learning there is a huge gap in quality between Forest's best 13 or 14 players, and the rest of the squad.\n\nPereira made six changes to his starting XI and none of those players are likely to be included for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash on the south coast.\n\nNottingham Forest survived a second leg scare in the Europa League, before Callum Hudson-Odoi's goal gave the Premier League side a 4-2 win on aggregate against Fenerbahce\n\nVitor Pereira's side had earned a 3-0 win in the first leg away from home, all but sealing the tie\n\nBut Kerem Akturkoglu struck in the 22nd minute of the game to make it 3-1 on aggregate\n\nThe Fenerbahce star then netted from the penalty spot after the break to set up a nervy finish\n\nThe travelling Fener fans hurled multiple flares on to the pitch in the first minute, causing a brief stoppage in play. Captain Ismail Yuksek pleaded for calm yet it was Forest who looked jittery.\n\nNerves are one thing, competence is another. When he arrived, Pereira talked about using his whole squad. How does he stick to those words after this? Morato, James McAtee and Lorenzo Lucca looked way out of their depth and Forest were lucky to be only 1-0 down at the interval.\n\nWhen Morato slipped on the halfway line in the 22nd minute, Forest were left two-on-two at the back. Neco Williams failed to cut out Sidiki Cherif's cross, allowing Akturkoglu to steady himself and finish from close range. Trying to respond immediately, Elliot Anderson collected a pass from Omari Hutchinson and fired a fraction wide from a narrow angle.\n\nCherif – twice – and Akturkoglu failed to profit from Forest mistakes and when the whistle went for half-time, the home fans made their feelings known.\n\nForest made four changes at half-time only for Fener to win a penalty within 25 seconds of the restart when Jair Cunha tripped Akturkoglu and the Turkey international converted confidently from the spot. And when Cunha had the chance to make amends soon afterwards, Tarik Cetin saved his effort.\n\nDespite the second goal, the arrival of first-team regulars Ola Aina, Ibrahim Sangare, Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi revived Forest a little, and it was Hudson-Odoi who lowered the collective heart rate inside the City Ground when his angled shot from 10 yards crept into the corner midway through the second half. Igor Jesus and Hutchinson then wasted chances to level it on the night as Forest edged through."

I don’t really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here (in Ottawa) and give everything I have here.\n\n\"I just think that's something that I never thought would happen in my head, and especially would never say.

Asked why they laughed, Tkachuk said: “Honestly, it was just a whirlwind of a moment that (you) can't really control what somebody says, and it's just caught (me) off guard a little bit.\"\n\nWomen's team captain, Hilary Knight, deemed the comment \"distasteful and unfortunate\", which Tkachuk understood, saying: \"I mean, I get it.

(0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

The list also includes: golfer Tiger Woods; former college football coaches Nick Saban, Mack Brown and Urban Meyer; former secretary of state and College Football Playoff selection committee member Condoleezza Rice; New England Patriots president Jonathan Kraft; NBA commissioner Adam Silver; Fox Sports president Eric Shanks; ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro; several athletic directors, including Notre Dame's Pete Bevacqua; former college athletes, including Florida quarterback Tim Tebow and Florida State basketball and football player Charlie Ward; and university presidents and chancellors.\n\nNo active head coaches were included in the group.\n\nIt's unknown whether everyone invited will attend the event, which is called the \"College Sports Roundtable.\" Multiple sources planning to attend expressed skepticism about how much could be done on a Friday afternoon with so many people from different backgrounds involved.\n\n\"It's people who could be involved in helping shape the future of college athletics and some of the solutions and strategies to structuring the athletic world going forward,\" said one source who plans to attend. \"It's so preliminary, it's hard to say anything with any sort of specificity because there hasn't been anything provided to us in writing of that sort yet.\"\n\nAlso expected to attend is billionaire businessman Cody Campbell, chairman of Texas Tech's board of regents and a former college football player, who has been working on a \"Saving College Sports\" campaign and involved in discussions about a possible roundtable for more than a year.\n\nLeaders throughout college athletics have also been meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill for years to rally support for legislation to help regulate NIL. Despite Trump's outspoken support and multiple politicians taking stances on issues such as athlete employment, the NCAA has been unable to get a bill to the floor for a vote.\n\nYahoo Sports was first to report the meeting."

Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process.\"\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes. The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough. He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Parliament’s approval of the Ghana Accelerated National Reserve Accumulation Policy (GANRAP 2026–2028) has sparked renewed debate over transparency and policy continuity.\n\nKojo Oppong Nkrumah, Minority Spokesperson on the Economy and Development Committee, took centre stage to urge the government to be more candid.\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the House, he framed the discussion around the long-standing Domestic Gold Purchase Program, first introduced under former Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia.\n\n“The program was designed to boost the foreign reserves by buying local gold and either adding it to bullion or converting it into forex,” he said, noting that GANRAP essentially continues the same framework under a new name.\n\n“Ghanaians deserve honesty,” he stressed. “If this government finds the program useful, there is no need to rebrand it as something new. Admit that you inherited a working policy and build on it. Candour is central to credible economic management.”\n\nGANRAP's key feature is its ambitious goal of adding US$9.5 billion annually to Ghana’s reserves through weekly purchases of approximately 3.02 tonnes of gold.\n\nUnder the policy, the Ghana Gold Board (GOLDBOD) will procure gold from small-scale miners, while a pre-emptive right will allow the state to acquire 20% of output from large-scale mining companies.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance says the policy is expected to strengthen Ghana’s foreign reserves and provide 15 months of import cover by the end of 2028.\n\nWhile acknowledging the potential benefits, Mr Oppong Nkrumah raised concerns about recent inconsistencies in the government’s handling of gold reserves.\n\n“A few weeks ago, they sold 50% of our gold reserves and converted them into U.S. dollar-based assets. Now they are asking Parliament to approve the purchase of more gold to replenish reserves. Why sell at $4,000 per ounce, only to consider repurchasing weeks later at over $5,200?” he questioned.\n\nThe MP argued that the current government should embrace continuity rather than reinvention.\n\n“The Ghanaian voter is informed and understands economic policies. You don’t need to rebrand, rename, or polish inherited programs. What matters is building on them responsibly.”\n\nMr Oppong Nkrumah also commended the aspects of GANRAP that align with Dr Bawumia’s earlier G-4-R principles, which emphasised domestic resource mobilisation, results-based management, and the use of gold as a stabilising anchor for the Ghanaian currency.\n\nHowever, he warned that without transparency, the program risks public scepticism and could undermine confidence in national reserve management.\n\nParliamentarians largely supported the policy’s operationalisation, highlighting its potential to strengthen gross international reserves without further borrowing.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

The military and the Ministry of Lands have data on all the seized excavators and their locations.”\n\nBeyond addressing the allegations, the Minister announced strengthened regulatory measures to curb the unchecked importation and movement of excavators — a factor widely blamed for fuelling illegal mining activities.\n\nHe revealed that government has introduced a nationwide digital tracking system designed to monitor earthmoving equipment across the country.\n\nThe initiative is being implemented in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA), and the Minerals Commission.\n\n“In furtherance to our efforts to regulate the importation of excavators, the Ministry of Lands, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, DVLA, and Minerals Commission, has rolled out a national excavator tracking system which provides a centralised national dashboard to monitor the movement and importation of earthmoving machines into the country.”\n\nThe Minister said the new platform will enhance transparency, strengthen oversight and support ongoing efforts to tackle illegal mining nationwide.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Refuse, for instance, is a major headache for the organisation.\n\n\"The organisation pays so much. So much refuse is generated in the area, and we spend so much, and it is all coming from the revenue that we mobilise from the centre to be able to do that,” he added.\n\nManagement maintains that the rent adjustment is necessary to ensure proper maintenance and sustained operations at the market.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Claims by the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) that the recent surge in rapid depletion of prepaid electricity credit is due to accurate readings from newly installed smart meters have been challenged by the Deputy Ranking Member of Parliament’s Energy Committee, Collins Adomako-Mensah.\n\nThe issue has sparked widespread concern among electricity consumers, with many reporting that their prepaid credit is running out unusually fast despite minimal usage.\n\nECG officials had suggested that the new smart meters are simply capturing actual consumption, in contrast to the older meters, which allegedly under-recorded usage.\n\nHowever, speaking on Citi FM on Thursday, February 26, Adomako-Mensah dismissed the explanation, describing it as implausible.\n\nHe pointed out that nearly one million smart meters had already been installed by the end of 2024, yet complaints about rapid credit depletion did not arise at the time.\n\n“These smart meters have been with us for some time, and the installation exercise is ongoing. The rapid erosion of prepaid credit only began about three to four weeks ago.\n\n\"If the issue were purely a matter of smart meters recording accurate usage, we would have seen this problem much earlier,” he said.\n\nAdomako-Mensah’s comments come as the Ministry of Energy and Green Transition has directed ECG to investigate the growing complaints to restore public confidence in the billing system.\n\nThe Deputy Ranking Member emphasised that the ECG explanation, attributed to its General Manager for External Communications, Dr Charles Nii Ayiku Ayiku, does not add up, given the timeline of smart meter installations and the sudden onset of the problem.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Their swift action brought relief and hope to families who feared the worst,” he said in his message.\n\n\n\nHe concluded by urging continued support for the security agencies, stressing that the safety of Ghanaians on land and at sea remains a top priority for Parliament and the nation.\n\n\n\nThe Member of Parliament further called on the President, as a matter of urgency, to immediately nominate a substantive Minister for Defence.\n\n\n\nHe argued that the absence of a substantive minister exposes the country to security vulnerabilities, particularly at a time when threats in the sub-region are evolving.\n\n\n\nHe warned that terrorist and jihadist groups could exploit perceived weaknesses in the country’s security leadership structure if urgent steps are not taken to strengthen institutional oversight and coordination.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

            "content": "The entire tree crops segment brings in roughly $750 million\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer of the Tree Crops Development Authority (TCDA), Andy Osei Okrah, says the $500 million commitment by President John Dramani Mahama to expand oil palm cultivation marks a decisive step toward transforming Ghana’s tree crops sector into a key driver of economic growth.\n\nThe funding will support the development of 100,000 hectares of new oil palm plantations, a programme projected to create around 250,000 jobs while helping the country diversify its agricultural base and reduce long-standing dependence on cocoa exports.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the Asaase Breakfast Show on Thursday, Okrah described the investment as evidence of government’s seriousness about the sector, noting that discussions are already ongoing with development partners and international financiers to mobilise the required funds.\n\n\n\n“That alone tells you the money is there,” he said.\n\n\n\n“Oil palm will lead, but all the crops have strong commercial potential.”\n\n\n\nBeyond oil palm, the broader strategy targets five additional crops — cashew, coconut, rubber, mango and shea — which the Authority believes can collectively reposition Ghana within the global agricultural value chain.\n\nTCDA projections suggest that each of the six crops could generate about $2 billion annually, lifting potential export earnings to as much as $12 billion per year through expanded production and value addition.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the entire tree crops segment brings in roughly $750 million, a small fraction of the $230 billion global market, underscoring significant growth opportunities.\n\n\n\nOkrah said investor appetite is already strengthening, with recent engagements drawing private sector commitments involving land acquisition and capital running into hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\n\nHe added that accountability will be central to implementation, with government-backed initiatives such as seedling distribution, grants and farmer support programmes subject to public tracking.\n\n\n\n“This is not a talk show. This is an impact investment drive,” he stated."

I said I wanted to be a pastor,” he recounted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, family members began calling him “Pastor” while he was growing up. However, he admitted that at the time, he did not fully grasp the spiritual weight of that declaration despite the numerous prophecies.\n\n\n\nOn whether he attended Bible school to prepare for ministry, Prof Amartey explained that his church provided structured spiritual training.\n\n\n\n“Revival Outreach Church itself is a pastoral school because there is constant training. Every Friday, we go to the Apostle’s house for training. The church is centered on Bible study, prayer, fellowship, soul-winning, and character formation, so it is a Bible school in itself,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe Resident Pastor of Revival Outreach Church, Prof Amartey also revealed that he initially hesitated when he was to be ordained as head pastor — a decision that came during his tenure as Vice Chancellor of UPSA.\n\n\n\n“That was the point I hesitated because I did not think I wanted to head a church.

When you have this type of situation, you're generating uncertainty and that's damaging for an institution's image.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the case at the same event, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said he \"can't talk about the timing of it\".\n\n\n\n\"I simply can't comment,\" he said. \"Having spent three years not commenting, I'm not going to start now.\n\n\n\n\"Stepping aside from that [specific case], any regulator wants its judicial system to be efficient and work swiftly.

The body was later conveyed to the Police Hospital Morgue.”\n\n\n\nAnthony, until his death, was an employee of Dizengoff Ghana Limited, a well-known agribusiness firm as IT Personal for Security installations for Akosombo, Ashanti Goldfields and others.\n\n\n\nAccording to the grieving father, the case was handled by Chief Inspector Bekoe under the supervision of ASP Zoyah, the Ayi Mensah District Commander.\n\n\n\nHe revealed that two men in plain clothes later visited the crime scene with the Investigator, claiming they had been sent from the Homicide Unit to assist with investigations.\n\n\n\nEhiamah disclosed that Chief Inspector Bekoe informed the family that two individuals-Obed Sam and Henry Gomashie-had been identified as prime suspects out of six persons interviewed.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the suspects allegedly contacted Anthony’s widow on the following day of the murder, claiming they had been assigned by their employer and were trying to reach him.\n\n\n\n“So, I quickly went to my son’s work place to find out if it is true that he was assigned but the reply was No”.\n\n\n\nIn a further disturbing revelation, Ehiamah said Anthony’s mother informed him that on the morning of his death, Anthony had confided in her that some individuals were using his bank account to transfer illicit funds and that his life was being threatened.\n\n\n\n“This information corroborated what the investigator himself told me-that monies meant for the school feeding programme were allegedly being siphoned into my son’s account,” he said.\n\n“My fear is that my son’s death is linked to these illicit transactions.”\n\n\n\nEhiamah questioned why, despite these alleged findings, no decisive action was taken.\n\n\n\n“When I asked the investigator what his next step would be, his responses were riddled with inconsistencies,” he claimed.\n\n\n\nHe said Chief Inspector Bekoe later informed the family that the docket had been forwarded to the Attorney-General’s office for advice.\n\n\n\nThe family went to AG office to find out if the Docket was sent to them but it was not so, they then petitioned the AG for the first time.\n\n\n\nThe father further alleged that the prime suspects were granted bail by the investigating officers without being arraigned before a court and without notifying the family.\n\n\n\n“We were shocked. On their own will, they granted bail. We were not informed. No court process. Nothing,” he said.\n\n\n\nEhiamah said he had since petitioned the Greater Accra Regional Police Command and the Office of the Inspector-General of Police, alleging possible misconduct and concealment of vital information by the officers handling the case.\n\n\n\nNow, he is appealing directly to President John Dramani Mahama, the Vice President, and the Inspector-General of Police to intervene.\n\n\n\n“Your Excellency, I respectfully submit this petition to cause an enquiry into the activities of these officers and to ensure a proper, independent investigation into the murder of my son,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe grieving father insisted he was ready to cooperate with any fresh or independent probe, even if it included the original investigators.\n\n\n\n“I will make myself available. I have nothing to hide. All I want is justice for my son,” he declared. “The very officers entrusted to protect lives must not be seen as shielding suspects. Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.”\n\n\n\nCopies of petition have so far been sent to IGP, Vice President office, EOCO, IN, National Security and the CID."

Ntim Fordjour maintained that equipping Ghana’s security agencies with modern assets must remain a national priority to safeguard lives, protect maritime resources, and preserve the country’s economic interests.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Carney’s trip comes at a time when he’s looking for new markets for Canadian exports to diversify from the US.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is heading to India for what experts say is a “very significant trip” as he tries to reset relations between the two countries and find new markets for Canadian exports.\n\nWhile the trip, which starts Friday, is expected to be heavy on diplomacy, experts question whether it will result in major economic deals to shore up Canada’s economy.\n\nCarney has pledged to broaden the country’s trading partners as relations with its neighbour, the United States, fray. And India, with its 1.4 billion people, is a potentially large market for Canada’s vast petroleum and natural gas reserves, among other products.\n\nBut to build those economic bonds will require Carney to overcome diplomatic tensions and hesitancy about the costs of its exports, according to analysts.\n\n“Canada domestically needs to figure out to what extent it wants to grow its oil and gas industry,” said Tarun Khanna, professor at the University of British Columbia who focuses on energy policy.\n\n“Improvement in the overall relationship can provide incentives to both nations.”\n\nRepairing a diplomatic rupture\n\nPart of the hurdle for Carney is repairing recent diplomatic strains between his country and India.\n\nThe two countries engaged in a prolonged diplomatic freeze in September 2023, after Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau alleged that India was involved in the killing of a Sikh separatist activist on Canadian soil.\n\nIndia rejected the allegations as false, and both countries expelled each other’s diplomats.\n\n\n\nA breakthrough came last year when Carney invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Kananaskis, Alberta, to attend the Group of Seven (G7) leaders’ summit in June.\n\nSince then, relations have thawed. In September, both sides named new diplomats to serve as high commissioners to each other’s countries.\n\nIn the lead-up to this week’s meeting, more bilateral collaboration has unfolded. Officials from India and Canada have engaged in senior ministerial and working-level engagements in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), liquefied natural gas (LNG), critical minerals and supply chain resilience.\n\n“This is a very significant visit and allows Prime Minister Carney to consolidate a reset that began in the relationship last year,” said Vina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, a research institute.\n\nFinding alternative trading partners\n\nBut the rapprochement with India also comes in a transition period for Canada.\n\nThe US has long been its primary trading partner: It is the only country it shares a border with. But since the return of President Donald Trump to the White House, the US has taken an aggressive stance towards trade with Canada.\n\nTrump has stacked steep tariffs on key Canadian exports like steel, aluminium and automobile parts. He also suggested he would like Canada to cede its sovereignty and become a state within the US.\n\nCarney has resisted such efforts, including by imposing counter-tariffs on US goods.\n\nBut in January, he gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he outlined his vision for “middle-power” states to break from the superpowers that seek their “subordination”.\n\n“From the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just,” Carney said.\n\n“This is the task of the middle powers: the countries that have the most to lose from a world of fortresses and the most to gain from genuine cooperation.”\n\nCarney’s trip to India, followed by Australia and Japan, is his first major trip to Asia following his Davos speech. Experts say the outing will give him a stage on which to spread his appeal for “genuine cooperation” among smaller economies.\n\n“It allows him to take that message of middle-power diplomacy to India, Australia and Japan, the three most significant for Canada in the Indo-Pacific region,” said Nadjibulla.\n\nThe trip also comes at a time when, on the domestic front, Carney’s top priority is to strengthen economic resilience, make sure investments keep flowing into Canada, and protect industries that have been hit by Trump’s tariffs.\n\n\n\nAs part of that push, Carney visited China last month, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so in almost a decade.\n\nA market for Canadian energy\n\nCarney’s latest trip is expected to yield announcements on Canadian exports of oil, natural gas, uranium and critical minerals, as well as cooperation with India on developing nuclear power as a clean energy source.\n\nThe outreach effort is “part of Carney’s strategy” to diversify its economic trading partners and find new markets for its products, according to MV Ramana, an expert in energy and security at the University of British Columbia.\n\nCanada is the fourth-largest exporter of crude oil in the world, and the fifth-largest oil producer overall. Its crude exports were valued at more than $100.7bn in 2024 alone.\n\nBut Ramana believes that negotiations will also centre on Canada’s uranium. The North American country is the world’s second-largest producer of the metal, which is key to nuclear power production.\n\n“Canada is trying to position itself as an exporter, a petro-state of sorts — not just for oil and gas, but also critical minerals and uranium,” Ramana said.\n\nIndia has a long history of nuclear cooperation with Canada, which provided it with a research reactor in the 1950s for its nascent nuclear programme.\n\nIt has continued to import uranium from Canada, and the two countries are in the midst of finalising a 10-year, $2.8bn deal that would ensure a supply of the metal to India.\n\nGiven that backdrop, Ramana said he expects to see announcements on small modular reactors for nuclear energy, even though there are currently only a few operating in Russia and China.\n\nThe first in North America — the Darlington New Nuclear Project — is in the works in Ontario, and Carney appears to be angling for Canada to become a leader in such small-scale reactors. But it won’t be easy, warned Ramana.\n\n“These are supposed to be cheaper, but they also produce far less power. As a result, the cost per unit of power generation will be much higher,” he said.\n\nAnother complication is the fact that the licence for the modular reactor design is owned by a US company.\n\nThat means the US will need to be involved, said Ramana, a tricky balance as Carney continues to be in the crosshairs of Trump.\n\n‘Combination of price and strategic decision’\n\nWith the largest population in the world, India’s already-huge energy demands are expected to keep increasing.\n\nKhanna, the energy policy expert, said that means there is likely to be negotiation about fossil fuels as well during Carney’s trip.\n\n“We don’t know what will materialise, but given the Indian energy situation, oil and gas is one thing that will be on the table,” said Khanna.\n\nBut India has also faced backlash under Trump about where it sources its energy supply from.\n\nIn August, the US president slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on India, doubling his tariffs on the South Asian nation to 50 percent, as a penalty for its import of Russian oil.\n\nThat was finally rolled back this month, and US tariffs on India were brought down to 18 percent, though that rate, among others, was overturned by a decision from the US Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nNow, the current US tariffs on Indian imports sit at 10 percent. But experts have warned that Trump’s tariff policies have sown uncertainty among the US’s trading partners, including India.\n\nSo New Delhi is looking to secure its oil supplies, and Canada is looking for new buyers, Khanna said. But price will ultimately be the key.\n\n“India is a price-sensitive market, so the Indian side will be looking for deals that secure supplies but at a reasonable price,” he pointed out.\n\nIf Ottawa seeks to increase its market, “then it’s up to them to see what kind of incentives they can hand out”, Khanna added.\n\nFor India to sign a deal, “it will have to be a combination of price and strategic decision”."

            "content": "Palestinians in the devastated enclave struggle to manage their daily lives amid shortage of cash caused by war.\n\nGaza City – Amid the buzz of customers in the Remal neighbourhood in Gaza City, Samar Abu Harbied stops at a small, makeshift roadside stall to buy groceries to prepare an Iftar meal for her family, to break their fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nWith no cash in her purse, the 45-year-old housewife asks the grocer if she could put the bill on credit, until her husband or son could wire the money to him.\n\n“I have not touched a paper note for months. I don’t even have money to pay for a taxi. Now we walk a lot, for long distances,” Abu Harbied said.\n\nNajlaa Sukkar, 48, was trying to catch her breath at the same stall, which is run by her son Abdallah, after a failed journey on foot to see a doctor for a post-surgery check-up and to buy medication.\n\nNajlaa said she did not have enough money to pay the 30 shekel (US$9.5) check-up fees, and the only banknote she had, a 20-shekel bill, was so worn out that the pharmacist turned it down.\n\n“I returned without receiving medical care,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“At the pharmacy, they didn’t accept the banknotes as they were frayed. The taxi driver didn’t accept a banknote, only small change, which I don’t have. It is very difficult to get by. What a mess, we don’t know what to do!”\n\nPalestinians in the Gaza Strip are struggling to conduct their daily lives amid a severe cash flow problem imposed by Israel immediately after it embarked on its genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023.\n\nA US-brokered ceasefire that went into effect in October has brought little reprieve to Palestinians, who are still using worn-out currency they had from before the war, or must rely on a new system of electronic payments conducted through smart telephones amid limited internet coverage.\n\n\n\nPalestinians in Gaza use the Israeli currency, the shekel, in their daily transactions, and depend on Israel to supply banks with new banknotes and coins.\n\nElectronic payments\n\nPalestinians were forced to turn to a digital payment system as a way to get around a severe shortage of Israeli shekel banknotes, a problem that has been exacerbated by the destruction of an estimated 90 percent of bank branches and cash machines.\n\nThe Palestinian Monetary Authority, working with internet service providers, has pushed for mobile-based electronic payments, including PalPay and Jawwal Pay, to help Palestinians overcome the liquidity problem.\n\nAbu Harbeid said her son switched to electronic payments after he faced many problems using the 50 shekels per shift he was receiving while working as a night guard.\n\n“My son, Shady, was receiving his daily wage in cash, which was worn and torn. We could hardly break it into smaller change or buy anything, as sellers don’t accept overused paper bills,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Moreover, the seller doesn’t accept it unless I spend it all, as they don’t have change. Now, as he is paid into his bank account, we buy everything through bank apps,” she added.\n\nBut digital payments have added another layer of hardship to a large segment of the population.\n\nMost Palestinians still do not receive bank-transferred salaries, many lack access to smartphones, and those who have phones struggle to keep them charged in an area where electricity services are in severe crisis.\n\nTo add to that, there is still the problem of finding a good internet connection for the transfer process.\n\nAbu Harbeid said a proper trip to the market requires her to have her husband or son with her to pay for goods. But neither can leave work to join her.\n\n“I prefer cash in my hand; I could buy anything on the go,” Abu Harbied said.\n\nNot only a liquidity shortage issue\n\nAnalysts say Gaza’s current economic reality started as a liquidity crisis, but has become an issue of transition from a regulated financial system to a fragmented survival economy shaped by scarcity, informality, and political constraints.\n\n“However, as the months passed, the crisis evolved into something far more structural,” Ahmed Abu Qamar, member of the board of directors of the Palestinian Economists Association, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\n\n“The black market now plays a dominant role in determining liquidity conditions. A small group of traders effectively manages cash circulation through high-commission cashing operations.”\n\nHe said that when money itself becomes a traded commodity, it signals severe distortion in the monetary system. “Cash, like any commodity, becomes subject to supply and demand dynamics. When it becomes scarce, its value increases beyond its nominal worth. From an economic perspective, this represents a structural disruption of the monetary system.\n\n“The formal banking sector and the Palestinian Monetary Authority were sidelined. What we are seeing is the neutralisation of the formal monetary system,” he said.\n\nAbu Qamar said the deeper issue was confidence – not just in cash, but in the financial system as a whole. “Cash is inherently difficult to track, whereas electronic payments are traceable and can be frozen or restricted. Implementing such a transition abruptly produces severe economic and social distortions,” he warned.\n\n“Widespread selling on credit is not a sign of market stability – it is an indicator of declining incomes and weakened purchasing power. When debt expands rapidly without a parallel increase in income, the result is social fragmentation. Approximately 95 percent of households in Gaza depend on aid,” he added.\n\nProfiteering from Gaza’s woes\n\nThe war has paved the way for middlemen to cash in illegally on the financial woes of Gaza, residents said.\n\nSukkar said that when her husband or sons needed cash, they were often forced to deal with brokers who charge a hefty commission that could reach 50 percent.\n\n“We lose our money to them for nothing; they steal from us under our full consent,” she said.\n\nMany residents, like Abu Harbeid, also do not trust bank transfers, saying they prefer physical cash in hand.\n\n“I ask my sons, where does that money in the account appear?” said Sukkar.\n\n“Who holds our money in their hands? I used to see money and count it, the banknotes and the change. On some days, when there are technical problems with the bank applications, we get nervous about the possibility of losing the money in their accounts,” she added.\n\nAbdallah Sukkar, whose family ran a well-known family store in the Shujayea area in eastern Gaza before the war, said families who receive direct deposit salaries often buy with bank transfers.\n\n“But I don’t like this method; I prefer cash,” he said.\n\nHe said he accepts all banknotes, whether new or worn-out ones, and allows people to buy on credit, but admitted that all of that affects his ability to make improvements to the roadside stall he now runs in place of his family’s old business.\n\nHe also complained of unpaid debts, adding that debts had soared by more than 500 percent during the war, while his profits barely reach 2 percent. He said he had given out 20,000 shekels’ worth of goods to new customers, “all of [whom] have become customers during the war”.\n\n\n\n“People don’t have money; I can’t turn them away when they come to buy food on credit. It’s already catastrophic in Gaza,” he said.\n\n“From the beginning of Ramadan till now, I haven’t had banknotes and change, which affects the sales. I don’t have small change to give to people who have cash, so they turn to other stalls or shops.\n\n“Yesterday, when the bank application stopped, we were terrified that we might lose our money in the bank,” he said."

            "content": "Al Jazeera’s correspondent in Kabul reports explosions and anti-aircraft fire as Pakistan bombs the capital city.\n\nPakistan has bombed Afghanistan’s capital Kabul and other cities as fighting spread following attacks by Afghan forces against Pakistani military positions along their shared border earlier.\n\nPakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that his country’s “patience has run out” with the Taliban authorities in neighbouring Afghanistan, and that Pakistan would now be waging “open war”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s correspondent in Kabul, Nasser Shadid, reported early on Friday that a bombing raid targeted the Afghan capital at 1:50am local time (21:20 GMT, Thursday), followed by a second air raid.\n\nAfghan anti-aircraft guns opened fire after the first raid and continued firing after the second, according to Shadid.\n\nAn Afghan government source confirmed to Al Jazeera that an air strike had hit Kabul, and Pakistani warplanes also hit a military base in Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan’s Defence Minister Asif framed the attack as one that his country had been forced to make, and followed “aggression” from Afghanistan.\n\nPakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that 133 Afghan Taliban fighters had been killed in Pakistan’s attacks on Friday, and that Taliban positions had been targeted in Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia.\n\nTarar said that nine Taliban positions had been captured and 27 destroyed, while adding that Pakistani attacks were continuing.\n\nAfghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that Afghanistan had launched its own attacks against Pakistani military bases in Kandahar and Helmand following the latest Pakistani attacks.\n\n\n\nThe strikes followed attacks by Afghan forces late on Thursday on Pakistani positions on the border shared by the two countries.\n\nAn Afghan military source told Al Jazeera that 10 Pakistani soldiers were killed in the attacks, and 13 outposts were captured.\n\nThe source added that the attacks were a response to Pakistani attacks on Afghan positions in the border region on Sunday.\n\nPakistan claimed that its attacks on Sunday had killed at least 70 fighters, but Afghanistan rejected the claim, saying that civilians had been killed.\n\nPoor relations\n\nA statement from the office of Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the whole country was united behind Pakistan’s armed forces.\n\n“The people of Pakistan and its Armed Forces are fully prepared to safeguard the nation’s security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity,” the statement said. “There will be no leniency in defending our beloved homeland, and any aggression will be met with a fitting response.”\n\nRelations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which share a 2,611-kilometre-long (1,622-mile) border, have nose-dived since fighting in October killed more than 70 people on both sides of the border.\n\nThe tension stems from Pakistani accusations that Kabul has allowed armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban to use Afghanistan as a base and launch attacks on Pakistan.\n\nThe Pakistan Taliban shares deep ideological ties with the Taliban in Afghanistan, but is a distinct movement.\n\n“Pakistan made every effort to keep the situation normal through direct means and through friendly countries,” said Asif. “It engaged in full-fledged diplomacy. But the Taliban became a proxy for India.”\n\n“In the past, Pakistan’s role has been positive. It has hosted five million Afghans for 50 years. Even today, millions of Afghans are earning their livelihood on our soil. Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” Asif said.\n\nIndia is Pakistan’s great rival, and the two countries fought a brief war in May. New Delhi condemned Pakistan’s attacks on Afghanistan on Sunday, calling them “another attempt by Pakistan to externalise its internal failures”.\n\nThe United Nations has called for urgent de-escalation. “[UN Secretary-General] Antonio Guterres urges the parties to uphold their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, and to ensure the protection of civilians,” Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, said.\n\n“The Secretary-General urges the parties to continue seeking to resolve any differences through diplomatic channels and commends the mediation efforts undertaken by several Member States in recent months,” he added.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Zalmay Khalilzad, a former United States ambassador to Afghanistan, said earlier on Thursday that the tit-for-tat attacks over recent days were a “terrible dynamic that must stop”.\n\n“A better option is a diplomatic agreement between the [two] countries that neither would allow its territory to be used by individuals and groups to threaten the security of the other,” Khalilzad said.\n\n“The implementation of the agreement should be monitored by a trusted [third] party, for example, Turkiye. This approach is a much wiser course than continuing with attacks and counterattacks.”"

            "content": "A federal judge has ruled that the Internal Revenue Service violated its code by giving a US immigration agency confidential taxpayer data.\n\nA federal judge in the United States has ruled that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) broke the law by disclosing confidential taxpayer information “approximately 42,695 times” to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nIn a decision issued on Thursday, US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly found that the IRS had erroneously shared the taxpayer information of thousands of people, in apparent violation of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe ruling cited IRS Code 6103, one of the strictest confidentiality laws in federal statute, which largely prohibits the disclosure of tax return information without consent.\n\nKollar-Kotelly said that the IRS violated that law “approximately 42,695 times by disclosing last known taxpayer addresses to ICE”.\n\n“The IRS not only failed to ensure that ICE’s request for confidential taxpayer address information met the statutory requirements, but this failure led the IRS to disclose confidential taxpayer addresses to ICE in situations where ICE’s request for that information was patently deficient,” she wrote.\n\nHer finding is based on a declaration filed earlier this month by Dottie Romo, the chief risk and control officer for the IRS, which revealed that the IRS had provided the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with information on 47,000 of the 1.28 million people that ICE had requested.\n\nIn most of those cases, Romo said, the tax agency gave ICE additional address information in violation of privacy rules created to protect taxpayer data.\n\nThe government is appealing the case, but the Thursday ruling is significant because Romo’s declaration supports the decision on appeal.\n\n\n\nKollar-Kotelly, meanwhile, called the Romo declaration “a significant development in this case”.\n\nWhat agreement does the IRS have with ICE?\n\nThe case is the result of a growing effort under the administration of President Donald Trump to consolidate government data, alarming rights advocates who fear an erosion of taxpayer privacy.\n\nPart of that data has been used to carry out Trump’s campaign of mass deportation, a key pillar of his second-term agenda.\n\nOn April 7, the IRS entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security to help with “non-tax criminal enforcement”.\n\nThat agreement, however, was widely understood to be the groundwork for the identification and deportation of immigrants in the US through taxpayer data.\n\nThe Center for Taxpayer Right sued the government over the disclosure, citing protections instituted after the 1972 Watergate scandal revealed how former President Richard Nixon misused tax data during his term.\n\n“This nation already once experienced a President who sought to collect tax information on his political allies and enemies in the White House for use for favor and punishment,” the centre wrote in an initial complaint.\n\n“Following the Watergate era, Congress clearly and unequivocally acted to protect the American people from these intrusions.”\n\nIt argued that taxpayer data is uniquely sensitive and “in grave jeopardy” of being shared broadly across the government.\n\nNina Olson, founder of the Center for Taxpayer Rights, said after Thursday’s ruling, “This confirms what we’ve been saying all along: that the IRS has an unlawful policy that violates the Internal Revenue Code’s protections by releasing these addresses in a way that violates the law’s requirements.”\n\nRepresentatives from the IRS and the Department of the Treasury did not respond to The Associated Press’s requests for comment.\n\nCurrently, the data-sharing agreement allows ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the US illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.\n\nThe deal, signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, led the then-acting commissioner of the IRS to resign.\n\nThere are several ongoing cases that challenge the agreement between the IRS and immigration authorities.\n\nEarlier this week, a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit declined to issue a preliminary injunction for the immigrants’ rights group Centro de Trabajadores Unidos and other nonprofits as they sue the federal government to stop implementation of the agreement.\n\n\n\nIn declining the preliminary injunction request, Judge Harry T Edwards wrote that the nonprofit groups “are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim”, since the information the agencies are sharing isn’t covered by the IRS privacy statute.\n\nStill, two separate court orders have blocked the agencies from massive transfers of taxpayer information and blocked ICE from acting upon any IRS data in its possession. Those preliminary injunctions are still in place."

At least one Cuban officer was also hurt in the gunfire.\n\nCBS News also reported that at least one US citizen was among the dead, citing White House officials.\n\nStill, Cuban officials defended their government’s response and alleged the speedboat passengers shot first at border agents.\n\n“Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist and mercenary aggression that seeks to affect its sovereignty and national stability,” Cuban President Manuel Diaz-Canel said in a social media post.\n\nThe incident comes during a period of heightened tensions between Cuba and the US, which has made repeated threats against the island’s communist government.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has also ratcheted up measures meant to worsen economic conditions there, including by imposing a fuel blockade on Cuba in late January.\n\nOnly one of the four men killed has been identified by the Cuban government so far: Michel Ortega Casanova.\n\nOne of Casanova’s associates told the news service AFP that he sought to overthrow the government in Havana.\n\n“His goal was to go and fight against a criminal and murderous narco-tyrannical [government], to see if that would spark the people to rise up,” said Wilfredo Beyra, head of the Cuban Republican Party in Tampa.\n\n\n\nFamily members of Casanova said that they were not aware of his plans but that he was motivated by the “great suffering” of people under the Cuban government.\n\n“No one knew,” Misrael Ortega Casanova, his brother, said. “My mother is devastated.”\n\nHe identified his sibling as part of a group concerned about rights abuses on the island.\n\n“They became so obsessed that they didn’t think about the consequences nor their own lives,” Misrael added.\n\nUS officials have said that they will investigate the incident and denied any government involvement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US embassy in Havana is seeking more details, including whether US citizens are among those detained.\n\n“We have various different elements of the US government that are trying to identify elements of the story that may not be provided to us now,” he said.\n\nThe US has worked with Cuban exiles against the country’s government in the past, including by supporting campaigns of clandestine infiltration, violence and sabotage.\n\nBut activist groups in South Florida have also launched their own operations, some of them running small speedboats and planes to ferry out Cuban nationals.\n\nCuban authorities have used US intervention as a pretext for the country’s steep restrictions on political dissent and a slate of security measures that rights groups say have been wielded against critics.\n\nCuban authorities identified some of this week’s speedboat passengers as Conrado Galindo Sariol, Jose Manuel Rodriguez Castello and Cristian Ernesto Acosta Guevara. More have yet to be identified.\n\nThe Cuban government also stated that some of the passengers were wanted by law enforcement authorities “based on their involvement in the promotion, planning, organisation, financing, support or commission of actions carried out in the national territory or in other countries, in connection with acts of terrorism”.\n\nMembers of the Cuban American community, however, have expressed scepticism about the Cuban government’s claims.\n\n“Nobody with a 25-foot speedboat tries to overthrow a government,” Emilio Izquierdo, a Cuban exile, told The Associated Press."

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” – a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

The company will shrink from more than 10,000 people to less than 6,000, Dorsey says in a post on X. And the reason why? AI.\n\n“We’re not making this decision because we’re in trouble,” Dorsey says. “Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter, Dorsey says that “We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.”"

Even the controllers are convertible: the right side controller can be used as a vertical mouse in “FPS Mode,” similar to the mouse mode on the Legion Go 2 or the Nintendo Switch 2. The right-side controller also has a built-in display that shows performance metrics and settings and doubles as a touchpad.\n\nThe Legion Go Fold is rumored to include an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 48 Whr battery. According to WindowsLatest, Lenovo plans to announce it as a concept device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, although it likely wouldn’t be commercially available right away, if ever."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow? Seems like we need to ask Apple and Google why they chose differently."

That’s according to the latest report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), which forecasts smartphone shipments to plummet 12.9 percent this year, marking its “lowest annual shipment volume in more than a decade.”\n\nAt the same time, the average selling price for smartphones is set to hit new highs, with IDC predicting a 14 percent increase to a record $523. “While memory prices are projected to stabilize by mid-2027, they are unlikely to return to previous level,” IDC senior researcher Nabila Popal says, adding that the sub-$100 phone segment will become “permanently uneconomical.” Next week, Apple is rumored to announce a new edition of its budget smartphone as the “iPhone 17e,” which could give a hint about where things are going.\n\nThe memory shortage is expected to impact budget-friendly Android smartphones the most, as the rising costs of components leave them with “no choice but to pass the costs on to end users,” Francisco Jeronimo, the vice president for IDC’s Worldwide Client Devices, says in the report. That could result in smaller brands exiting the industry, while allowing Apple and Samsung to grab more market share, according to Popal."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

            "content": "In a flurry of deal offers in the high tens of billions of dollars, the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery is over. David Ellison-owned Paramount will acquire Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\n\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

            "content": "A rise in the need for computers and data centers to power AI is causing a massive shortage of RAM, driving memory prices sharply higher. Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest single-year dip in more than a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC reported that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that figure will drop to just 1.12 billion this year.\n\n“The memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping the long‑term TAM [total addressable market], the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” said Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average retail price of a smartphone is expected to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, smartphone ASP [average selling price] is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she added.\n\nPopal also noted that rising component costs could make the sub-$100 smartphone “permanently uneconomical,” pricing out phone makers that manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, shipments in the Middle East and Africa will drop more than 20% year-over-year. China and the broader Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) will also see declines of 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei added."

            "content": "Iowa lawmakers voted to advance state House bill 751 last week, legislation that would ensure farmers in the state can freely repair their own agricultural equipment, like tractors. This Tuesday, the bill was renamed to House File 2709, and it will be voted on again. Should the political winds align, it will go through the Iowa House and Senate before the Iowa Legislature adjourns on April 21.\n\nThe bill is the first of nearly 57 state bills supported by repair advocates across the country in 2026. Many of them focus on farm equipment in states like Oklahoma, Wyoming, Delaware, and West Virginia. Repair advocates hope a win in Iowa—the second-highest-grossing state in the US for agricultural products, behind California—will help further legislative and broader efforts to make phones, cars, and other devices more repairable.\n\n“This isn't just a blue state thing; this isn't just a Colorado activist thing,” says Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability for the right-to-repair advocate arm of iFixit. “Its real. Farmers have trouble repairing their equipment and want change.”\n\nFarmers and their tractors have long been a focal point of the right-to-repair movement, the ever-growing global effort to let product owners fix their own devices and equipment without manufacturer approval. Farmers who use tractors to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops often need to repair their equipment while they work. Waiting for manufacturer approval to get something fixed, or taking the time to bring the equipment to an approved dealership, can cause delays, frustration, and missed opportunities to harvest crops.\n\nThe Iowa bill defines which agricultural equipment it covers, including tractors, trailers, combines, sprayers, balers, and other equipment used to cultivate and harvest crops. It excludes aircraft and irrigation equipment, along with jet skis and snowmobiles.\n\nManufacturers would also be required to provide owners with data—documentation, like manuals, and access to embedded operating software—on their tractors, including future patches and fixes, all without charging for it or requiring authorization for internet access. The bill also limits the use of digital locks—software restrictions that prevent accessing features without manufacturer approval.\n\nOh Deere\n\nThe most prominent opposition to the Iowa bill is tractor manufacturer John Deere, which has a long history of opposing repair efforts and frustrating farmers who want to take more control of their equipment. The company is still fighting a lawsuit the US Federal Trade Commission levied against John Deere in January 2025 for “unlawful” repairability policies. The company has lobbied against the Iowa bill and outright opposes its passing.\n\n“John Deere is steadfast in supporting farmers' ability to repair their equipment,” wrote a John Deere representative in a statement responding to WIRED’s inquiry. “And we back that up by offering industry-leading self-repair tools and resources to both equipment owners and alternative service providers.”"

It combines the abilities of Google’s previous release, Nano Banana Pro—like text rendering and web searching—with speedier image generation. This tool will be the new default in Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n\nThe first image model from Google under the Nano Banana moniker dropped last August, and the Pro version arrived three months later. The AI tool was widely adopted online to alter photos of real people, from generating custom action figures to nostalgic images of people hugging younger versions of themselves.\n\nNano Banana 2 is not only faster at crafting images, it’s also a more powerful photo editor. Despite some rough edges and unconvincing generations in my initial hands-on experience through Gemini, Google’s latest release marks the continued improvement of photorealistic AI tools that can manipulate existing images and serves as a stark reminder to always scrutinize unverified images you see online.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIf you want to try the new image model, the easiest way to access Nano Banana 2 is through the Gemini app or website. You can either click the banana emoji to generate images or just put the request in your prompts to the chatbot. This new image model is also available through Google’s Search tools, AI Studio, Cloud, and other services.\n\nGoogle says the Nano Banana 2 image generator pulls real-time information from the web, which can be useful for generating infographics. To test this, I asked Gemini to generate a custom weather report for my upcoming weekend getaway. Here’s my prompt:\n\nI'm going skiing in Dodge Ridge this weekend with some friends. Could you create an infographic that covers the weather conditions?"

It is Season 50, so we have Survivor players of eons past that are coming back to compete for the million dollars. I am so excited. It's going to be incredible. Zoë, my goal in the next few months is just to make you watch one, one, of the episodes. This is very important to me.\n\nBrian Barrett: If you were to make Zoë watch a historical episode of Survivor in isolation, what one hour of Survivor would you show her?\n\nLeah Feiger: Can I say a season, or does it have to be an episode?\n\nBrian Barrett: I want to go with that, because I don't think you're going to get her for a whole season.\n\nLeah Feiger: So I'm going to do the second-to-last episode of the Micronesia season of Survivor. Absolutely incredible season, known for the Black Widow Brigade. Zoë, I actually think you would really like it. Well, anyway, that is my WIRED. My TIRED—and I'm kind of devastated to say this—is Love Is Blind, which is ... I know that my theme was reality shows this week. Look, I have a lot of I wouldn't say love for Love Is Blind, but I have a lot of interest in Love Is Blind. I am an avid Love Is Blind watcher. I think it is a super interesting concept and a very weird show and produces a lot of very weird people. But there is a excellent WIRED article coming out about how MAGA it's gotten, and that those are the people that are going on the show right now, and the conversations that are happening between these couples who met behind a wall and are off to get married several weeks after knowing each other, the conversations are quite sad. They're making me sad. There's a lot of body shaming and it's just very—it's weird. So this season, it's not doing it for me, which that's OK, because Survivor is here to lift me out of the doldrums. That is my WIRED and TIRED. I stand by it. I swear that I read books and stuff too. I do not want this to be my only brand on this show.\n\nZoë Schiffer: Certainly not. Brian, drag us out. I need to get on firmer ground.\n\nBrian Barrett: OK. Well, I'm going to go TIRED. Samsung just announced some new phones. Those aren't TIRED, but TIRED is AI overload in phones. There's too much. So at this point, the new Samsung Galaxy S26 smartphones—similar to Google's conversational photo editor—they have a photo assist thing that lets you use natural language, so you can just type in. If you have a photo that you took, you can say like, \"Hey, give my dog a party hat,\" and then there will be a party hat on the dog. What's the point of taking photos anymore? Why not just prompt something instead from scratch, or just go touch some grass? I am curious about—they've got agents built into the phone, so you can use the phone. You can just say, \"Hey, order me a pizza,\" and the phone will just do that for you. We'll see if it works. I don't know. It seems like it might go off the rails. Anyway, too much too soon for me. That's my TIRED. I didn't plan a WIRED. I was so caught up on the phone, but because it came up earlier, I'll say the new Muppet Show episode with Sabrina Carpenter is really quite good, and I hope that it got a good enough response that Disney makes more of them."

            "content": "AI agents like OpenClaw have recently exploded in popularity precisely because they can take the reins of your digital life. Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers.\n\nToday, anyone can ask DeepSeek or Qwen a question about the Tiananmen Square Massacre and immediately see censorship is happening, but it’s hard to tell how much it impacts normal users and how to properly identify the source of the manipulation. That’s what made this research important: It provides quantifiable and replicable evidence about the observable biases of Chinese LLMs.\n\nBeyond discussing their findings, I asked the authors about their methods and the challenges of studying biases in Chinese models, and spoke with other researchers to understand where the AI censorship debate is heading.\n\nWhat You Don’t Know\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying AI models is that they have a tendency to hallucinate, so you can’t always tell if they are lying because they know not to say the correct answer or because they actually don’t know it.\n\nOne example Pan cited from her paper was a question aboutLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. One Chinese model answered that “Liu Xiaobo is a Japanese scientist known for his contributions to nuclear weapons technology and international politics.” That is, of course, a complete lie. But why did the model tell it? Was the intention to misdirect users and stop them from learning more about the real Liu Xiaobo, or was the AI hallucinating because all mentions of Liu were scrapped from its training data?\n\n“It's much noisier of a measure of censorship,” Pan says, comparing it to her previous work researching Chinese social media and what websites the Chinese government chooses to block. “Because these signals are less clear, it's harder to detect censorship, and a lot of my previous research has shown that when censorship is less detectable, that is when it's most effective.”"

            "content": "Silicon Valley has always prized “high-agency” individuals—people who impress their ideas upon the world by thinking for themselves and taking action without being told what to do. But as the performance of AI coding tools has surged, so has the industry’s emphasis on humans being \"agentic\" themselves.\n\n“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion. “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.”\n\nThat idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley. A viral Harper's essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity.\n\nSimon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain.\n\n“Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.”\n\nTo be fair, Last is kind of describing himself. He acts as a “super IC” for Notion, and he doesn’t manage humans, only agents. But the way he manages them is not unlike how a manager oversees employees. Last is constantly delegating work to AI agents, then closely reviewing and fixing their code.\n\nKothari says Notion has always hired people with high agency, but the value of doing so has gone up dramatically in recent months. Even though the company is using AI agents to automate work, Notion is busier than ever. Employees are shipping products at a higher velocity and doing more work overall, the cofounders claim. Notion isn’t downsizing its team because of AI, but it is hiring differently. “There's more value in the Valley today to have a few Simons than thousands of engineers,” says Kothari. He says the people Notion hires need to understand “the new way of working.”\n\nIf you’re not a software engineer, this can be a little hard to process. AI agents aren’t very useful for people in many industries. A recent survey from Gallup found that most Americans still don’t use AI much in their jobs, though the number of people who do is rising. Kothari is increasingly convinced the “new way of work” will eventually hit finance, legal, creative, and other industries. If and when that happens, you can imagine more Americans beginning to ask themselves, am I agentic?"

            "content": "OpenAI has announced plans to turn its London office into its largest research hub outside of the United States.\n\nThe company—which established a UK office in 2023—says it will expand its London-based research team, scooping up talent emerging from leading British universities. It has not indicated how many researchers it will hire.\n\n“The UK brings together world-class talent and leading scientific institutions and universities, making it an ideal place to deliver the important research which will ensure our AI is safe, useful, and benefits everyone,” said Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nThe plans bring OpenAI into direct competition for top research talent with Google DeepMind, the AI lab run by British researcher Demis Hassabis, which is headquartered in London. DeepMind has long-running partnerships with Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, where it sponsors professorships, funds research, and works alongside researchers.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former AI researcher who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Joel_Khalili.28.\n\nAt the latest careers fair at Oxford University, the floor was packed with undergraduates looking for technical roles and recruiters hiring for AI-related positions. “The demand and supply is increasing on both sides, even within a year,” says Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at Oxford University. “To have something like this turn up is a really positive sign.”\n\nOpenAI’s expansion in London could have a sort-of flywheel effect, whereby the researchers it hires early in their careers go on to start new labs in the UK, says Tom Wilson, partner at venture capital firm Seedcamp. “We’ve seen many examples over the years,” he says. “That’s where these kinds of announcements can have even more impact than the initial hires … the second-order effects can be great.”\n\nOpenAI’s team in London will continue to contribute to products like Codex and GPT-5.2, the company says, but will now “own” certain aspects of model development relating to safety, reliability, and performance evaluation.\n\nIn a statement, the UK’s science and technology secretary, Liz Kendall, described the announcement as “a huge vote of confidence in the UK’s world-leading position at the cutting edge of AI research.”\n\nThe announcement coincides with a push in the UK to scale the nation’s data center and power infrastructure to meet the voracious demand for compute among AI companies, including OpenAI."

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."

Discovery.\n\nLate Thursday, Netflix walked away from its planned acquisition of HBO, HBO Max, and Warner Bros. studios' business. The streaming giant said it \"had declined to raise its offer\" after Paramount submitted a revised all-cash bid of $31 per share on Tuesday to buy WBD in its entirety. WBD had reviewed the rival offer and announced that its board of directors found it \"superior\" to the Netflix agreement.\n\nNetflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement: \"At the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say: \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US.\"\n\nHowever, according to Netflix, the transaction was more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" at any price.\n\nIf approved, Paramount's new bid would see it not only pay $31 per share in cash, but also be on the hook for a $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe Netflix for backing out of its agreement. Additionally, Paramount would also be responsible for paying \"a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after Sept. 30, 2026,\" according to WBD, and pony up $7 billion should the deal not pass regulatory requirements.\n\nParamount's deal is backed by cash from Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nThe merger-acquisition plan between Netflix and WBD was originally announced on Dec. 5 for $83 billion (stocks and cash). The deal has since seen several takeover bids from Paramount, prompting Netflix to switch to an all-cash deal in January while Paramount engaged in a back-and-forth to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe announcement arrives on the day of WBD's Q4 earnings call, and the same day that Netflix's Sarandos visited Washington, DC, to meet with officials amid the Paramount bid.\n\nCNET's Corinne Reichert also contributed to this report."

Instagram owner Meta said on Thursday that it's rolling out the new notifications to parents in the US, UK, Australia and Canada, with other regions to follow later this year.\n\nThursday's update follows the 2024 introduction of teen accounts. It applies to parents using the platform's optional parental supervision setting, which requires consent from both teens and their parents to participate. Parental supervision allows parents to see the accounts their teen follows, set a time limit for how long their teen can use the app and more.\n\nIf teens repeatedly make suicide-related searches, parents will receive alerts via in-app notifications and email, text or WhatsApp, depending on available contact information. In addition to informing parents of their teen's searches, notifications will allow them to \"view expert resources designed to help them approach potentially sensitive conversations with their teen,\" according to Meta.\n\nAn example of the alerts. Meta\n\nMeta said it would prompt an alert if a teen attempted to search for phrases promoting suicide or self-harm and phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves. The company said its policy is to block searches for self-harm and suicide content and direct people to resources and helplines.\n\nThis move by Instagram is just one of many digital safety measures aimed at protecting young people online. It comes as governments push their own guardrails: Australia recently enacted the world's first ban on social media accounts for children under 16, and the United Kingdom is considering similar restrictions. These efforts reflect a broader trend toward embedding protective technologies and policies around young people and their online use, even as debates about privacy, autonomy, and effectiveness continue."

            "content": "Samsung has introduced three new S26 handsets at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year: the S26, the S26 Plus and the uber premium S26 Ultra. The S26 Ultra continues the company's tradition of Ultra handsets that offer top-of-the-line features that are lacking from the rest of their respective series. And this year, the Ultra's Privacy Display is the clear highlight feature, allowing you to customize how visible your phone is to others around you.\n\nAside from that, the S26 Ultra's other improvements are somewhat marginal. Yes, it's now made out of aluminum, the screen is a touch bigger, a 16GB RAM option is available, the processor is improved and the charging speeds are faster, but the rest of the S26 Ultra's features are similar to that of the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Even the price remains the same at $1,300.\n\nHere is how the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra compares with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nWatch this: First Look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra: Camera, Battery and AI Updates 02:56\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra only has a marginally larger screen compared to the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra have 6.8-inch AMOLED screens with 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution, while the new S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display also with a 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution. All three screens have a 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nBut it's the pixel-level Privacy Display that's particularly impressive with the S26 Ultra. When activated, the display will remain visible when looking directly at the phone while making it difficult to impossible to see what's on screen from the side. In addition to letting you turn the feature on and off for different apps, you can even have the Privacy Display activate exclusively for notifications while keeping the rest of the screen plainly visible.\n\nThe S26 Ultra's screen uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 cover glass, while the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra both use Gorilla Glass Armor. Gorilla Glass Armor 2 is said to be more scratch and drop resistant compared to its earlier version.\n\nSize-wise, the S26 Ultra is a touch bigger but also a touch thinner compared to its predecessors. CNET Senior Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti describes the new design as feeling thinner and lighter than prior Ultra phones during her hands-on time. It measures 6.44 by 3.07 by 0.31 inches, while the S25 Ultra's dimensions are 6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and the S24 Ultra measures 6.4 by 3.11 by 0.34 inches. Also, the S26 Ultra has an aluminum frame. That's a departure from the titanium frame found on both the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nThe cameras on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCameras\n\nWhile the S26 Ultra certainly has the best camera hardware of the S26 lineup, it has the same exact camera specs as its predecessors. All three Ultra phones have four cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto. That said, the S26 Ultra does have larger apertures and to capture better low-light photos. They also all have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nMany of the S26 Ultra's camera upgrades come from software. There's the Horizontal Lock feature that'll keep the horizon steady while shooting video, selfies can now capture more natural skin tones and screenshots will now be sorted into its own categories within the Gallery.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nBattery, processor and RAM\n\nAll three Ultra phones have a 5,000 mAh battery, but the charging speeds differ. The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra have 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, while the new S26 Ultra has 60W of wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Just like the S25 Ultra, the S26 Ultra does not include magnets but can support magnetic charging accessories when using a case that includes them.\n\nThe processors in the Ultra phones also get progressively faster and more efficient with each generation. The S24 Ultra has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the S25 Ultra uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and the S26 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy.\n\nWhile all three Ultra handsets come in three storage capacity options -- 256GB, 512GB and 1TB -- the S26 Ultra is the only one with a 16GB RAM option. (This ships with the 512GB and 1TB options.) The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra only ship with 12GB of RAM.\n\nCheck out the below chart to compare more details between the S26 Ultra, S25 Ultra and S24 Ultra."
