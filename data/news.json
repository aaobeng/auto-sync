            "content": "A SMALL town has found itself at the center of World Cup chaos after refusing to grant a license for matches to be played at the New England Patriots’ stadium until someone else foots a $8million security bill.\n\nA worried local business owner has told The U.S. Sun that the town fears being left bankrupt if expected to cover the multi-million-dollar tab, as they beg Pats owner Robert Kraft to intervene.\n\n\n\n\n\nGillette Stadium is due to stage seven matches, including marquee knockout games, during Fifa’s global showpiece event, which starts on June 11.\n\nThe first match is slated for June 13 when Scotland face Haiti.\n\nBut in Foxborough, the tiny town of 18,000 residents 22 miles from Boston where the 65,000-seat stadium stands, resentment is growing over the massive funds needed to cover police and public safety costs.\n\nA five-person, locally-run select board has refused to approve the event license without financial guarantees from tournament organizers.\n\nUnless resolved, the home of the Pats, which will be called Boston Stadium during the tournament, and its doors may remain closed.\n\nTerri Lawton, whose Oake Knoll family farm sits in the shadows of the stadium, told The U.S. Sun that the tension is real.\n\n“I think the select board is doing a great job trying to protect residents,” she said.\n\n\n\n“We’re a very small town. We don’t have $8million to front — and even if we did, we shouldn’t. As far as I know, there aren’t any assets backing it.”\n\nLawton hopes Kraft — whose personal wealth is estimated at over $13billion — will cover the costs, fearing the local economy could crumble if residents are forced to foot the bill.\n\n“The reality is the Kraft family will earn more this year than most people in town will make in their lifetimes,” she continued.\n\n“If they want this to happen, the Kraft Group can simply write a check. They probably spend more than that in a month on payroll alone.”\n\nThe board has set a March 17 deadline for license approval, emphasizing that security planning and equipment must be secured months in advance.\n\n\n\nDuring the NFL season, billionaire owner Kraft and the Kraft Group handle these licenses.\n\nFor soccer’s World Cup, however, the stadium has been leased to Fifa under a new agreement, which requires cities to cover the costs of policing, security, and public safety.\n\nFifa requires venues to be secured for all 39 days of the tournament, not just matchdays, increasing costs.\n\nBill Yunka, vice Chairman of the Foxborough select board, described staging the soccer matches as “an NFL game on steroids” and the equivalent of “39 Super Bowls,” according to local outlet WCVB.\n\nHis fellow board member, Stephanie McGowan, added that the World Cup is “probably more of a headache than it’s worth.”\n\n\n\nBoston was allocated $46million last year – from the $625million plan under President Donald Trump’s One, Big, Beautiful Bill – that could be used toward the security fees.\n\nBut bureaucratic delays have left a significant gap for town officials.\n\nA February federal government shutdown has further delayed processing of funds promised to host cities through the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nYukna also said the Kraft Group is willing to front money equivalent to the expected grant, but it doesn’t cover the full difference and Foxborough would still have to hand over millions.\n\n\n\nMoney issues\n\nFarmer Lawton notes that under the current stadium lease, the town receives only 67 cents per ticket sold, the same rate set in 2000 when tickets were $60.\n\nToday, tickets cost a minimum of $100, and police salaries and road wear have increased, but town revenue hasn’t.\n\n“The Krafts are entrepreneurs,” she said\n\n“Their goal is to keep as much revenue as possible. The selectmen’s job is to protect residents. That’s difficult when you’re negotiating with an $11billion company.”\n\n\n\nShe added, “I hope the Kraft family will cover the cost, because I don’t want taxpayers paying it.\n\n“If they want the World Cup here, they’ll gain more financially than anyone else. As a business owner, I remove obstacles to make deals happen. I don’t understand the hesitation.\n\n“Spreading the $8million across 18,000 residents would have serious effects. We wouldn’t be able to pay teachers, police, or firefighters. This isn’t emotional — it’s business. We have to fund essential services.\n\n“The selectmen have told the Kraft Group and the Boston organizing committee for over a year that the town wouldn’t front the money. We’re a town, not a bank. The Kraft Group has invested heavily to bring it to Foxborough.”\n\nShared costs\n\nUnder Fifa’s hosting agreements, the organization takes the lion’s share of revenue—ticketing, broadcast rights, sponsorships, and parking.\n\n\n\nHost cities handle security, public safety, transportation hubs, and protection for officials, including Fifa president Gianni Infantino. Infantino predicts tournament revenues topping $11billion and a U.S. economic impact of $30billion.\n\nLawton said despite the claims the tournament will bring in a profit for the area, local businesses may struggle during the tournament.\n\n“Traffic is so heavy that locals stay home,” she noted.\n\n“Chase Lumber on Route One could have a tough June because no one wants to fight traffic. It’s congestion, not government restrictions.”\n\nThe dispute over the license has overshadowed any excitement in Foxborough before soccer’s biggest stars descend.\n\n\n\n“The bottom line,” Lawton said, “is the Kraft Group will make substantial money from this event. The town just needs to protect itself.\n\n“This isn’t about spite. The town simply doesn’t have the money and has to protect itself.”\n\nThe World Cup is just over 100 days away, yet organizational problems have already begun.\n\nA six-week fan fest in New Jersey has been scrapped due to financial issues, and a similar event in Miami faces funding problems.\n\nMeanwhile, violence in Mexico following the killing of cartel boss Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes has raised questions about staging crucial qualifying matches in the country later this month.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe opening game is scheduled to be in Mexico City.\n\nThe U.S. Sun reached out to Fifa and the Kraft Group for comment, but neither has responded."

Keith Andrews’ side also boast a phenomenal record on the road, having won six of their last seven in all competitions – losing only to Chelsea. Burnley, meanwhile, have won just four of their last 34 Premier League home games, those victories coming against Sheffield United, Leeds and Sunderland.\n\nIpswich vs Swansea: Ipswich win at 3/5\n\nI’m all aboard the Ipswich Town strong-finish-to-the-season bandwagon.\n\nKieran McKenna’s expensively assembled side sit third in the Championship and will be desperate to make their games in hand count. That starts against a Swansea side they’ve beaten in each of their last three meetings – including a 4-1 win away earlier this season. The Tractor Boys have won seven of their last eight on home turf and should have enough to see off their low-scoring opponents, who have netted just 14 times in 16 away games and possess the third-worst away record in the division.\n\nWycombe vs Burton: Wycombe win at 3/4\n\nI just love Wycombe at home.\n\nOnly two League One sides – Cardiff and Lincoln – have scored more home goals than Michael Duff’s men this season, and they currently occupy the automatic promotion spots. The Chairboys have won four of their last five on home soil by an aggregate score of 11-1 and look well placed to secure another three points this weekend. Burton did enjoy a thumping win over Stockport in midweek, but that came on their own patch rather than on the road – where they’ve won just one of their last eight and conceded two or more goals on six occasions.\n\n\n\nColchester vs Salford: Colchester win at 5/4\n\nThis might have been a controversial pick a month ago, but Salford are now in a death spiral, having lost each of their last five in succession – including a 3-1 defeat to rock-bottom Newport County on home turf.\n\nManager Karl Robinson admitted his side were enduring a “horror run”, with the players feeling “low”. We think that gets worse this weekend with a trip to Colchester, who bagged an impressive 4-1 win over Barnet in midweek and have won five of their last six at home.\n\nLincoln vs Blackpool: Lincoln win at 4/9\n\nI don’t think a huge explanation is required for this selection.\n\nLincoln are League One’s most in-form side, having taken 13 points from a possible 15 over their last five games. Only Cardiff and Bradford boast better home records this season, while Lincoln haven’t tasted defeat there since a shock loss to Exeter back in October 2025. They’ve also found their shooting boots in recent weeks, scoring 15 in their last five at home. Blackpool? They’ve lost four of their last six on their travels and hold the second-worst away record in the division.\n\n18+. New customers only. Football Accas only. 5 legs or more.

But there it was again: a determination to prove people wrong.\n\n“I think most people, the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person thought I was finished - at my age being a footballer and what I had,” said Milner.\n\n“So it was probably that same thing that meant I'm still playing now really to be honest, to just prove and not finish your career in a way that wasn't really in your control.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images James Milner has enjoyed a trophy-laden career (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere is one last record to be broken.

            "content": "Liverpool fans agree as Jayden Danns takes them aback in new training footage\n\nJayden Danns has returned to training for Liverpool for the first time since suffering a hamstring injury in September, with fans noticing the same thing\n\nView 2 Images Jayden Danns has received a wave of positive compliments following his first training session in five months (Image: YouTube/Liverpool FC)\n\nFollowing a five-month spell on the treatment table, Jayden Danns has given Liverpool fans fresh cause for optimism. The 20-year-old has returned to training for the first time since sustaining a serious hamstring injury back in September.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe striker, whose father is former Premier League midfielder Neil Danns, has been out of the public eye since that setback. Yet it's taken virtually no time for the Reds prospect to begin showcasing his quality again among his academy colleagues.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSupporters were largely united in their response after catching their first glimpse of the forward in nearly six months. Danns has netted 29 times in 48 appearances across Liverpool's under-18s and under-21s, with fans eager to see him replicate that output at senior level.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAt the bare minimum, he certainly possesses the physical attributes to compete alongside the first-team squad. That was a recurring observation among supporters after Liverpool's official YouTube channel offered a behind-the-scenes glimpse at his comeback to action.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n\"Danns is huge,\" wrote one commenter, clearly convinced the youngster has shot up during his spell on the sidelines. He was already standing at roughly six feet tall when he picked up his injury, though at just 20, it's entirely feasible he hasn't yet reached his full height.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nArne Slot confirms Liverpool's worst fears with concerning injury update on star READ MORE :\n\nOthers couldn't hide their excitement, with one supporter hailing Danns as \"the next starboy.\" Not every response was quite so measured, mind you, as another fan simply declared: \"DANNS IS SOOOOO BACK.\"\n\nOne supporter even raised the question of whether the emerging talent was ready to be thrown straight into first-team contention. More level-headed fans were quick to intervene, however, reminding that rushing him back too soon would only risk stunting his long-term development again.\n\nView 2 Images Danns has scored three times in 10 senior appearances for Liverpool (Image: Ed Sykes/Sportsphoto/Allstar Via Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nExpectations are sky-high for what lies ahead for Danns. Physically, he certainly appears to tick the boxes required to thrive at the very highest level.\n\nFurthermore, he's already netted three goals (all in the FA Cup) across 10 senior appearances for the club he's supported since childhood. He spent a portion of last season on loan at Sunderland but failed to make a single appearance for the Black Cats because of a back injury.\n\nHe certainly has his work cut out given the formidable options currently available to Arne Slot. Alexander Isak has been ruled out for several months with a broken leg, but the Premier League's record signing and Hugo Ekitike represent a formidable partnership to dislodge once back to full strength.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFor the time being, though, Danns' sole priority should be focused entirely on regaining his own fitness. And it's evident a considerable portion of the club's supporters are firmly behind him in that pursuit.\n\nJoin our LFC WhatsApp community and get all the latest LFC news, views, transfer gossip and more, as it happens We also treat our community members to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

Chief executive Richard Masters has announced on Thursday that Premier League +, a direct-to-consumer platform, will be launched next season to show all 380 games.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite the Premier League's insistence otherwise, industry experts believe it could be the first step on the road to the blackout being lifted. Minal Modha from Ampere Analysis says that, while the Premier League don’t want to upset Sky Sports and TNT Sports, who are paying them £6.7bn over the current broadcast deal, they are keen to test the market.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“There’s still a handful of games in the blackout, so maybe they will become the first step towards a direct-to-consumer platform because it’s not damaging to any of the packages that they’re already in the market selling,” Modha told Mirror Football.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“That way they’re not competing with TNT or Sky for scheduling slots, because they don’t want that either. Those 3pm slots feel like they could be a happy medium to test the waters in the UK.”\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK! Latest news, analysis and much more on Mirror Football's Facebook page\n\nMan City could hand Pep Guardiola a new job once his exit is confirmed READ MORE :\n\nSky Sports has the rights to 215 games currently, with TNT showing a further 52, and their money is still vital to the Premier League. Mirror Football understands that, for now, neither broadcaster feels threatened by the Premier League’s move, which has been in the works for some time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“If they’re going to do it in the UK, those 3pm games are the best way without upsetting broadcasters,” Modha added.\n\n“Unless what they do is take one of the broadcast packages away, but then you’re taking away potentially guaranteed broadcast revenue. My gut says they will spend the next three years rolling out direct-to-consumer in other markets, testing it out, before making a call on the UK.”\n\nDespite the last Premier League broadcast deal being hailed as a record, it was actually a backwards step, with the rights worth £1.675bn a year, less than the £1.713bn a year over the 2016-2019 seasons. The fragmentation and stagnation of the sports rights market in Europe is a problem for the Premier League, as is the piracy that comes with the 3pm kick-offs.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nView 3 Images The Premier League is launching its own streaming service (Image: Mark Leech/Offside via Getty Images)\n\nModha says the league wants to future-proof its business without jeopardizing their broadcast partners. She draws a comparison with F1, which launched F1 TV Pro, its own direct-to-consumer platform, but has used it mainly as negotiation tactic with broadcasters while not stepping on the toes of Sky Sports.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat is partly because the costs associated with going to a full streaming services, instead of using broadcasters, would be too high. Ampere Analysis have estimated that Premier League + would need to cost between £45 and £56 per month in order to come close to matching what the league already makes from TNT and Sky.\n\nIt therefore makes commercial sense for the Premier League to lift the 3pm blackout, in place to protect attendances, and open up more content to viewers. That move would come after the conclusion of the current rights cycle in 2029, but wouldn’t be without risk.\n\nThe Premier League would have to appease the Football League, who are in favour of the 3pm blackout on Saturdays in order to encourage fans to attend matches. They would also have to convince fans to fork out for yet another subscription.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images The Premier League doesn't want to upset Sky Sports (Image: PA)\n\n“We’re living in a time when purses are already squeezed, people are struggling with rising fuel and food prices already,” Modha noted. “Normally entertainment is well shielded from that, but sport can sometimes be more vulnerable because it becomes harder to justify so many services.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Football Supporters Association said: \"The English pyramid is the envy of the world with attendances all the way down to non-league dwarfing those of elite level games in many other countries.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“That must be protected. We're all responsible - leagues, clubs, fans - for maintaining that environment in which the game can survive and thrive. Any changes to the 3pm blackout must include all stakeholders, they cannot be based on one league, and its broadcasting wants, alone.\"\n\nNevertheless, it could go down well, with polling by YouGov in November revealing that 57 per cent of fans oppose the blackout, although that percentage dips to 47 per cent among match-going supporters.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

There's a combination of horses that have been walloped for wins last time out and horses who are not well-handicapped. I kept going further and further down and ended up with Josh The Boss for two reasons.\n\n\"Firstly, he's a novice and is unexposed to a degree over fences. He's had more runs than I've had hot dinners this year. This will be his seventh start of the season. He is backing up after running at Newcastle last week but he clearly takes his racing well. He jumps well for a novice and I thought last time out he had the run of the race and jumped well aside from nodding on the back of four out.\n\n\"His old nemesis Prairie Wolf will not be in to beat him this day and although it's a worry that he won't be able to dominate this field, I do believe he wants a good, even gallop over this trip because he'll probably stay a little further. If he's bounced out of the race alright, with Jamie Neild taking 7lbs off he has got a handicapping chance.\"\n\nKate Tracey\n\n\"Vincenzo is a standout for me, he looks as if he's got so much more to come. Last time out at Ascot he won by two lengths from Bad. It was a messy race overall but it was really good form in terms of talented horses and a testament to him that he can still produce this kind of effort, sticking to his task really well after hitting the front at the last.\n\n\"He's only been given a 2lb rise for that and I thought that was very fair and he could be even better going back left-handed, which suits him really well. I hope he's got plenty more mileage in his mark.\"\n\nSam Boswell\n\n\"The good news about Heltenham, if you like him like I do, is he loves it around Newbury. He's had one bad run from about six efforts, with three wins and a second to his name. His second was on seasonal reappearance this year against Twinjets. He got beaten by 10 lengths but there's a stone in favour today in favour of Heltenham, which is a massive plus point.\n\n\"I know we don't get the services of Harry Skelton but these are the types of races they're winning en route to a championship and Heltenham is going to be a massive plus point through the spring. He obviously went up against Jonbon last time, which was effectively a run to get round - he managed that.\n\n\"I do hope going back to his favoured Newbury will bring out the best in him. Charlie Todd has ridden the horse before to reasonably good effect when finishing third. We're a double digit price and he's an each-way play, I don't know why he won't be all out to take a really valuable prize.\"\n\nWatch Weekend Winners in full on the At The Races YouTube channel..."

Two years on from a dramatic penalty shoot-out win against Lille in the Conference League, the two sides meet again.\n\nPantomime villain Emiliano Martinez starred on that day, saving the decisive penalty after avoiding a red card midway through the shoot-out, despite receiving his second booking of the game.\n\nTrademark celebrations soon followed as he soaked up the animosity from the French crowd. That, coupled with his antics from the World Cup triumph with Argentina over France, could create quite the cauldron at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy when he returns.\n\nImage: Emi Martinez celebrates Aston Villa's ECL victory over Lille in 2024\n\nVilla will be tasked with replicating the same success over two legs to continue their quest to end their 30-year wait for a trophy and if they do achieve that, the drama won't stop there.\n\nA meeting with Roma and on-loan striker Donyell Malen could then await, should they be successful in the tie against Bologna. UEFA rules state no team can influence what line-up their opponent selects and that would allow Malen to face off against his parent club in a bid to dump them out of the competition.\n\nPorto, Nottingham Forest, Midtjylland and Stuttgart make up the rest of that side of the bracket. Villa were undoubtedly handed a harder route to glory; the storylines running alongside it just add to the drama.\n\nHome advantage in second legs for seeded teams\n\nThe top eight teams from the league phase in both competitions are seeded and will have home advantage in the second leg of their round of 16 games.\n\nThis will extend to the quarter-finals for the teams that finished in the top four of the league phase if they progress.\n\nThe top two will also have home advantage in the second leg of their semi-final if successful.\n\nAny team that eliminates a seeded team will take their privileges.\n\nWhen are the 2025/26 knockout stages?\n\nRound of 16: March 12 and 19\n\nQuarter-finals: April 9 and 16\n\nSemi-finals: April 30 and May 7\n\nFinal: May 20\n\nWhere are the finals?\n\nThe Europa League final will be held at Besiktas Park in Istanbul on May 20.\n\nThe Conference League final will be one week later at the Leipzig Stadium on May 27."

Were they to reach the semi-finals, Arsenal's opponents will be Newcastle, Barcelona, Atletico or Tottenham.\n\nAnalysis: A favourable draw for Arsenal?\n\nA trip to Germany awaits for Arsenal as they face Bayer Leverkusen for the first time since a 4-1 win in 2002. Win that tie, and it's Bodo Glimt or Sporting next. It's a favourable draw, especially given the alternative was a potential quarter-final against Manchester City.\n\nIt's only two years since Leverkusen won the Bundesliga under Xabi Alonso but they are no longer the same team. Having finished second last season, they now sit sixth, with Kaspur Hjulmand at the helm after Erik ten Hag's brief spell in charge ended in September.\n\n\"We are very excited to play the next round,\" said Mikel Arteta at his press conference on Friday. \"We have earned the right to be in a strong position with what we've done in the group stage.\n\n\"Now we need to start to analyse them and find ways to be better them and try to go through the tie.\"\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Arne Slot has them in better shape ahead of their next meeting.\n\nThe Reds have avoided a last 16 tie against Atletico Madrid but their route to the final, beyond the meeting with Galatasaray, for which they will be strong favourites, looks daunting, with Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich potentially standing in their way.\n\nBefore that, though, it's a potentially awkward trip to Turkey, and a reminder that any side containing Victor Osimhen has to be taken seriously.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

            "content": "Being teetotal, always asking questions and taking up yoga in his early 30s after a recommendation from Gareth Barry have played their part. But if one thing inspired James Milner to break the Premier League’s appearance mark then it is a trait honed during his formative years in Yorkshire: sheer bloody-mindedness.\n\n“Some things don’t change,” Milner says with a chuckle when asked whether his desire to prove people wrong was as strong as ever after his 40th birthday last month. “There’s people who are always going to doubt you but that’s always something that’s been at my forefront: to prove them wrong.”\n\nMilner credits his father for instilling the fighting spirit that has carried him through a remarkable 24 seasons in English football’s top flight. He started as a 16-year-old with Leeds under the watchful eye of Terry Venables, and has had spells at Newcastle, Aston Villa, Manchester City, Liverpool and now Brighton.\n\n“He knew what I was like and he used to say: ‘You don’t work hard enough, you’re not going to make it,’” he says of his father. “He’d never say it in a horrible way or anything like that. But he’d be like: ‘You got no chance of scoring the goal from there.’ And then [I would] take free-kicks and two shots later it’s in the top corner. He knew how to get the best of me.”\n\nThe same desire provided motivation after it seemed Milner’s career was finished in 2024 when he was unable to walk following knee surgery. He spent nine months on the sidelines before returning at the end of last season.\n\n“I think most people – the surgeon, the physio, people who knew what I had, probably every single person – thought I was finished; at my age being a footballer and what I had,” he says. “So it was probably that same thing that meant I’m still playing now: not to finish your career in a way that wasn’t really in your control. That was the drive really. I wanted to try to prove that I could get back from that because I don’t think many people could.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner salutes the fans after the final whistle in Leeds’ victory over Chelsea in December 2002, a month after his Premier League debut as a 16-year-old. Photograph: Gareth Copley/PA\n\nIt has been particularly satisfying for Milner that, having come off the bench more than 200 times in the Premier League, he started on his 654th appearance to break his former Villa teammate Barry’s record when Brighton overcame Brentford last week. “My body doesn’t agree to sitting still, so that’s why I don’t like being on the bench so much,” he says.\n\nHe relishes his role as the elder statesman of the Brighton squad and reveals that the teenage striker Charalampos Kostoulas has been joining him for yoga sessions. “I probably started maybe eight or nine years ago now, which I think Gareth put me on to actually,” he says. “We’re passing it down, so I’ve passed it on to Babis [Kostoulas] at this moment. He’s only 18, so he’s starting young.”\n\nMilner, whose rippling muscles bulge as he holds court at Brighton’s training ground in Lancing, recognises he has been fortunate that his career coincided with the rapid growth of sports science. He uses strengthening techniques created by the celebrated German athletics coach Frans Bosch to counteract injuries that have included a fractured ankle at Newcastle and 12 hamstring problems, meticulously tracks his sleep patterns and takes magnesium to boost a natural shortfall in his body. Milner believes the decision to never drink alcohol, made during his schooldays in Horsforth, outside Leeds, is another of the secrets to his longevity.\n\n“I’ve never had a problem with people drinking at all – I think it’s healthy,” he says. “Like if that’s the right time to do it and if that’s your thing to get away from football and go have a blast, then I’ve no problems with it all. But it’s just a decision I made that if it would help me, I wouldn’t do it.\n\n“When I first started playing you had maybe one or two physios, maybe a part-time masseur, one fitness coach. Now you’ve got five or six fitness coaches, you’ve got seven or eight in the medical team. So that’s been to my advantage that I’ve managed to learn from that to ask questions early.\n\n“I always ask questions: ‘Why are we doing this?’ Or: ‘Explain it to me so I understand and then I decide if it is the right thing to do. I’m not just going to do it because you say. Give me the information why. Give me the science behind it.’ It was interesting, a few of the messages I had over the weekend were: ‘You were a nightmare to work with,’ or ‘challenging to work with’. But I take that as a compliment that I push them to be better and ask questions and challenge them. The best people always come out and give you the exact reason why you’re doing it.”\n\nThings have changed from his youth, when Milner recalls “teacups flying and walls being punched” at half-time by irate managers. “You don’t see much of that now,” he says. “I just feel fortunate. I played through two eras; one when I was emerging and now another.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner, with then teammate Jordan Henderson, holds the FA Cup after Liverpool’s win in 2022. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nMilner was presented this week with three Guinness world records: one for the appearances, another for most consecutive Premier League seasons (23) and the third for the longest gap between his first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days). The next milestone on the horizon is surpassing Teddy Sheringham’s record as the Premier League’s oldest outfield player at 40 years 272 days, though Milner has never been inspired by chasing records.\n\nHe is yet to open discussions with Brighton about extending his stay beyond this season – a prospect recently welcomed by his 33-year‑old head coach, Fabian Hürzeler – but is keen to stay and he denies fearing what retirement may bring.\n\n“When we have some days off I look forward to that: go and play golf, spend time with the family. So I feel whenever I finish, I’ll probably have a break and a rest because I’ve been so 100% for so long.”\n\nView image in fullscreen James Milner with his three Guinness World Records certificates. Photograph: Paul Hazlewood\n\nHaving worked under Venables, Sir Bobby Robson, Roberto Mancini, Jürgen Klopp and many other of the game’s finest managers, Milner is well placed to judge what makes a good one. He rates his two seasons as a central midfielder at Martin O’Neill’s Villa as his best from an individual perspective, and has especially fond memories of winning City’s and Liverpool’s first league titles for a generation. There are doubts about his prospects of making the transition to the dugout when he hangs up his boots.\n\n“It’s such a hard gig, innit? You see managers getting a new contract and getting sacked in two months. People don’t get the time they deserve now. But the competitive guy in you thinks: ‘Yeah, I wouldn’t mind giving that a go.’\n\n“I’ve got a great array of different managers from different countries and different personalities to lean back on, so in one way I think it’d be a big shame to lose all that knowledge and experience I’ve built up, to not be able to use that.”"

            "content": "The draw for the Champions League last 16 has produced some intriguing, heavyweight clashes featuring the renewal of old rivalries. If Manchester City’s meeting with Real Madrid arguably ranks foremost among them, Chelsea’s engagement with the holders, Paris Saint-Germain, and Newcastle’s duel with Barcelona are certainly not lacking in glamour.\n\nOr, in the case of Chelsea and PSG in particular, edge. The tie is a repeat of last summer’s Club World Cup final in New Jersey, which Chelsea won 3-0 thanks to two goals from Cole Palmer and with a team under the management of Enzo Maresca.\n\n“I’m so excited,” said Liam Rosenior, Maresca’s successor. “PSG are fantastic. I’ve experience of playing them in France [as Strasbourg manager] and I’ve always admired them. Luis Enrique has done a fantastic job there.\n\n“These are the games you live for, games that you come into football for. It’s going to be a great tie.”\n\nIn Rosenior’s three fixtures against PSG at Strasbourg he won one, drew one and lost one.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, will return to Istanbul as part of a tricky rematch with Galatasaray. Arne Slot’s side lost 1-0 in Turkey in a September league-phase meeting.\n\nArsenal have been handed a somewhat kinder draw in Bayer Leverkusen as they continue to compete on four fronts “We’re really excited,” said Mikel Arteta. “Let’s try to be there until the last stage of every competition. And then we’ll see what happens.”\n\nA Tottenham team likely to be prioritising Premier League survival will meet Atlético Madrid, meaning a swift reunion for Conor Gallagher, who joined Spurs from the Spanish club in January. With all 16 teams provided with a route map to the semi-finals, Atlético’s Diego Simeone and Tottenham’s Igor Tudor also know their sides are playing for a quarter-final date against either Barcelona or Newcastle. Should Spurs keep progressing, a north London semi-final against Arsenal is a possibility.\n\nIf Arsenal overcome Leverkusen, they will meet the winner of Bodø/Glimt versus Sporting in the last eight while Liverpool could face Chelsea, which would no doubt reignite memories of their Champions League battles from previous decades.\n\nShould Manchester City make it past Madrid in what will be a fifth Champions League knockout meeting in five years, Pep Guardiola could be set for a potential reunion with Bayern Munich on the basis that they overcome Atalanta, Italy’s remain representative in the competition, in the last 16.\n\nNewcastle’s meeting with Barcelona will reprise evocative memories of Sir Bobby Robson, who managed both clubs, as well as Faustino Asprilla’s treble at St James’ Park during a 3-2 Champions League win over the Spanish giants in 1997. The two sides also met at St James’ Park in September, with Hansi Flick’s side winning the league-phase encounter 2-1 thanks to two goals from Marcus Rashford.\n\nIn the Europa League, Nottingham Forest have been drawn against Midtjylland with the Danes doubtless bolstered by memories of their 3-2 win at the City Ground in the league phase in October. With Aston Villa, who face Lille, in the same side of the draw as Forest, there is no prospect of an all-English final, although they could clash in the semis.\n\nVilla and Lille crossed swords in a Conference League quarter-final two years ago, with Villa prevailing follow a rather chaotic penalty shootout featuring some theatrics from Argentinian goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez.\n\nCrystal Palace will face AEK Larnaca of Cyprus in the last 16 of the Conference League."

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts show.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot said it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype. The 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th-minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said of putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down to earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one v one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "THE CLASS(IC) SYSTEM\n\nLa Liga has El Clásico, France has Le Classique, and Argentina goes full gun with its Superclásico. English football has no true equivalent, with Liverpool and Manchester United fans unable to agree on a name for their grand-slam meetings. Up in the land of fitba, there’s this weekend’s 450th Old Firm/Glasgow derby (delete as applicable according to your stringency on Scottish company law). And Germany has Der Klassiker, between Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. The Bundesliga marketing suits have been out in force this week for the one game, played on Saturday evening, that brings extra eyeballs. Though questions are often raised over whether this is a true, classic rivalry; Dortmund have not won a league title since Jürgen Klopp was making his rounds in 2012.\n\nSince then, Bayern have celebrated a league title with lashings of weissbier outside the Rathaus every year save for 2024, when Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen went unbeaten to wear the crown. Dortmund v Bayern, is it a historic rivalry? Well, not really, since Bayern’s dominance of the Bundesliga goes back to 1968-69, when they succeeded Eintracht Braunschweig and Nürnberg as champions. The 1970s took in Borussia Mönchengladbach as their chief rivals, what with Günter Netzer, Allan Simonsen and all that.\n\nIt was not until the mid-90s that Dortmund, with two domestic titles and a Big Cup in 1997 (run Lars Ricken VT) realised the dreams of their vast fanbase. Here is where the needle began, with a spat between all-round nice guys Lothar Matthäus and Andy Möller in 1996 and then Oliver Kahn’s flying kick on Stéphane Chapuisat before biting Heiko Herrlich’s ear in 1999. All good stuff if you want to build up a deep-seated rivalry. After near-bankruptcy followed their 2002 Bundesliga triumph, it took Klopp’s heavy-metal thunder for Dortmund to upend Bayern. Since then, while FC Hollywood strut to repeated titles, Dortmund have become football’s leading kindergarten, a finishing school rather than a credible challenger.\n\nThis season, Bayern are eight points clear of Dortmund at the top, and only a win at the Westfalenstadion will prevent another procession. “For me, it’s always a title in its own right, even if people say we can’t win anything more now,” roared Vincent Kompany, ever the hype man. “These games are also important to the masses.” Kompany’s Bayern face a Dortmund team probably unable to believe what happened against Atalanta in Bigger Cup, Ramy Bensebaini’s swinging heel into Nikola Krstovic’s head a moment to have them waking up screaming in the night for decades. What might also keep Dortmund coach Niko Kovac awake is the prospect of facing Harry Kane, living up to the standards set by Robert Lewandowski in modern times and Gerd Müller in Bayern’s first golden era, scoring 45 goals in 37 matches for club and country this season. Truly best in class.\n\nLIVE ON BIG WEBSITE\n\nJoin Tom Bassam at 8pm GMT for red-hot Premier League minute-by-minute updates on Wolves 0-0 Aston Villa.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n“It’s not looking to the style now at this moment. The style needs to be in the second moment, because now it’s a question of life and death if I can say that in that way sportingly” – Igor Tudor, there, channelling Bill Shankly as he explains why Tottenham might not be wowing the league with whizzy play as they fight for top-flight survival.\n\nView image in fullscreen Igor Tudor: maybe he’ll talk about socialism next week. Photograph: John Walton/PA\n\ndouble quotation mark I just hope the hapless Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini (yesterday’s Football Daily) does not follow my path. I too was directly responsible for four opposition goals in one game: one came from my taking a corner that curved behind every one of my teammates, allowing five of the other lot to advance on our puffing centre-back; another was me slicing a clearance so badly that instead of arcing down the touchline, it went at 90 degrees, landing at the feet of an opponent with enough time and space at the edge of our box for his own Grand Designs project. I never again played any form of competitive sport” – Michael Hann.\n\ndouble quotation mark I feel compelled to point out that Ramy Bensebaini played left-sided centre-back of a back three against Atalanta rather than left-back (yesterday’s Football Daily). I noticed this because of the body language of his teammate Daniel Svensson each time Bensebaini recklessly served a goal up on Wednesday. Svensson was the recovering left wing-back at the Algerian’s side, head bowed and shoulders increasingly drooping” – Matthew Parham.\n\ndouble quotation mark I’ve come to the conclusion that the collection of words at the bottom of Football Daily’s full email edition (that rarely makes any sense to me) are a form of the popular location app what3words and give the venue of that evening’s secret ‘drinks’ for the hard-working hacks. It hasn’t escaped me that, when there are more than three words, my theory sheds more water than something that sheds water” – Shaun.\n\ndouble quotation mark Regarding yesterday’s last line ‘Hot Parents’ Chat Ahoy’ (full email edition), am I the only one wondering if it is the chat or the parents that are hot?

            "content": "A European occasion that appeared ominous for Celtic instead provided evidence that it is never wise to write off Martin O’Neill. His side exited the Europa League in Stuttgart but the scale of spirit and togetherness visible during their 1-0, playoff second-leg victory emphasised that tales of their demise may be overstated.\n\nCeltic’s key attribute during a critical week, which begins at Ibrox on Sunday, is course and distance specialism. The shortcomings within, and patched-up nature of, O’Neill’s squad are blindingly obvious. This is, however, a club that has become accustomed to dominating Scottish football over more than a decade. Much earlier, O’Neill had demonstrated he could emerge successful from title scraps. Contrary to giddy analysis, there is nothing miraculous or remarkable about O’Neill’s work during his second short-term stint of the season. It is, though, immediately striking how a 73-year-old can achieve such buy-in from players. Faith in O’Neill within Celtic is absolute.\n\nThis Celtic season, typified by managerial upheaval and protesting supporters, retains a pulse. Stuttgart felt significant because Celtic, in makeshift form, displayed character. The easier option would have been to limp out of the Europa League. Instead, there was an unwillingness to concede an equaliser that reflects positively on O’Neill and his squad.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill (left) is in his second interim stint of the season at Celtic and has galvanised the players after a rocky period. Photograph: DPA/PA\n\nOn Sunday they face a Rangers team who are under considerable pressure to prove they will not deliver another campaign typified by false dawns. Rangers’ home form is strong but Danny Röhl’s team are yet to remove the sense of a soft underbelly, demonstrated by draws at Hibernian, Motherwell and Livingston. The most recent of those, last Sunday, was a horrendous result; Livingston had not won in 25 league matches. The stakes are huge for Rangers, who should be embarrassed if a net spend of about £30m is not sufficient to prise the title from Celtic – at one point managed by Wilfried Nancy – and a Hearts side assembled for buttons in comparison. Celtic’s seven Premiership losses to date match their combined tally from the previous two seasons.\n\nA Rangers win would place Celtic in tricky territory, five points behind their oldest foes. Celtic’s game in hand will be played in Aberdeen on Wednesday, before a return to Ibrox on Scottish Cup business. Hearts hope to extend their lead at the top to seven points on Saturday when Aberdeen visit Edinburgh. An Old Firm draw would suit Hearts perfectly.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rangers’ Danny Röhl speaks to the media on Friday – his side are four points behind Hearts and two above Celtic. Photograph: Luke Nickerson/Rangers FC/Shutterstock\n\nStuttgart gave O’Neill plenty food for thought. Luke McCowan’s terrific performance in midfield should afford him a start at Ibrox. O’Neill’s public backing of Kasper Schmeichel suggests he will restore the veteran goalkeeper despite almost weekly errors. Schmeichel’s deputy, Viljami Sinisalo, repelled Stuttgart. Auston Trusty’s suspension leaves Celtic weak in central defence. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who was not in Celtic’s European squad, was surely signed to play in fixtures such as the derby.\n\nO’Neill is aware of a bigger picture, despite that hardly being his concern given he is due to leave in the summer. “European football is what big clubs in Scotland should be aiming for,” he said. “Not for the coefficient points to be dropping out of sight. It’s ridiculous. This is what it’s all about.”\n\nHis regular reference to the country’s coefficient, which is indeed dipping to a worrying level, is intriguing. There is a theory Celtic’s reluctance to spend heavily on players is linked at least in part to knowledge that their potential lack of access to European revenue in upcoming years could swallow up cash reserves. In a worst-case but feasible situation, Celtic could be staring at Conference League football. This does not, however, explain the horrendous lack of preparation for this season’s Champions League playoff tie. Sensible investment would have been sufficient to topple Kairat Almaty, who instead left Celtic with red faces.\n\nThe shadow boxing has started. McCowan has asserted no team in the league can touch Celtic when at their best. In truth, it would be more of a story had McCowan stipulated Celtic are also-rans. Röhl cast aspersions on Celtic’s approach in Stuttgart; this was amusing, given Rangers finished 32nd out of 36 in the Europa League table.\n\nAll Old Firm jousts are fascinating. This one carries more meaning than most. Events in Germany suggested Celtic are formed of the kind of substance that Rangers must be wary of."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "Michael Carrick has hinted that Harry Maguire will be offered a new deal with Manchester United and believes “there’s a lot more to come” from the defender.\n\nMaguire’s contract runs out in the summer and he has yet to sign a new one, but there is optimism at Old Trafford that he will stay at the club he joined for £80m in August 2019. United host Crystal Palace on Sunday, aiming to extend their six-match unbeaten run under Carrick. They have only dropped one point in that period, with Maguire’s value to the interim head coach seen by the fact he has started every fixture of his tenure.\n\n“Harry’s an impressive character. He’s had a great career so far, hopefully there’s a lot more to come,” Carrick said. “The journey and the experiences that he’s had, certainly since he’s been here and with England as well, showed exactly what he is. I think we all know the player that he is and what he’s capable of doing.\n\n“The other night [against Everton] I thought he was fantastic. Experience helps. His attributes help, and his character. His willingness to put himself out there. He’s really impressive at his age and he’s been really important for us.”\n\nThe 32-year-old has not always been universally popular since arriving from Leicester but has rediscovered his best form in recent weeks. It is likely that Maguire will need to take a wage reduction to remain at the club, but following the announcement that Casemiro will leave at the end of the season, there is an eagerness to keep some experience around the squad.\n\n“Within the squad there’s always that balance,” Carrick said. “You want that younger potential and that excitement of developing players and helping players. but you need that little sweet spot in the middle where the play is at the peak. You need that within the group and experience is massive. It’s hard to put a price on how valuable that can be, whether that’s individuals or experience as a whole group.”\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe is keen to keep costs down and wages is a key part of it, especially after it was revealed in a filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday that the sacking of Ruben Amorim and his staff could cost the club up to £16m. United said in a November 2024 filing they were paying Sporting £10m to hire Amorim to replace Erik ten Hag, whose exit was costing £10.4m. The combined changes around Amorim’s appointment could cost United £36.3m."

Their expensive striker needs goals, and he starts in central midfield.\n\n\"Now, this is possibly because he doesn't trust him up front. He didn't play well in central midfield. Eddie Howe said he didn't play well in central midfield, saying it is the least he's affected the game since he arrived at the club.\n\n3 Woltemade recently ended his goal drought against Aston Villa Credit: Getty\n\n\"Now, on the talkSPORT YouTube channel, there is a programme called Inside The Toon, and it's all things Newcastle United, and Jack Cunningham is one of the contributors.\n\n\"He said, 'Newcastle should build the team around Woltemade'. Well, if Newcastle want to go down to the Championship that might be a brilliant idea. I do wonder what planet this guy is on.\n\n\"Is he a nine? No. One goal in 18 games is not a nine. Is he a midfielder? No, definitely not.\n\n\"Is he a ten? Have a look at the number tens around the Premier League. Morgan Rogers, Cole Palmer, Bruno Fernandes. Morgan Gibbs-White etc.\n\n\"There are better number tens in the Championship than Woltemade. Two Premier League assists all season, and when did Newcastle play with a ten? They aren't going to rip up that three-man midfield to put Woltemade at ten.\n\n\"Let's get this right. He is a footballer, he's got talent. But he has not got a place in the Newcastle United team, and I think that is the fundamental flaw here.\n\nInside The Toon on talkSPORT talkSPORT does Newcastle like nowhere else.

But it's the way Newcastle play, the fact they needed to replace Isak, Howe is putting him all over the park trying to find a place for him.\n\n\"£70m and he hasn't even got a place in the team? That's your big signing. That's a joke signing. So pound-for-pound, for what a team needed and what he brings, I make Woltemade the worst-ever Premier League signing.\"\n\nWell that's me told. But let's put it into context...\n\nDurham's comments came in response to the following point: \"He is someone you should build the team around,\" I said on Inside The Toon.\n\n\"It probably would be as a number ten, eventually because with Stuttgart players were always close to him. If you get players close to him, we can see what he can do.\n\n\"There were a few times against Qarabag, even in the second half when he was getting frustrated and losing the ball, there were times where he is picking up brilliant little pockets of space, and we don't find him.\n\n\"People are watching him and making him a scapegoat for things not working this season.\n\n\"You've got to accept that this is a £69million brilliant footballer, and you've got to find a way to get him in the team and work around it.\n\n\"There is this perception that because he's 6ft 6, he should score a load of headers. If you watch him, you'll realise that is not his game.\"\n\n3 Even if you discount his actual ability, the statistics for a forward in his first Premier League season aren't even that bad\n\nCase for the defence\n\nNewcastle at some point have to evolve if they are to be consistently a top side.\n\nWe see Arsenal and Manchester City play in different ways from game-to-game.\n\nBoth of those sides have a good mixture of technical and physical players, while the Toon have too many of the latter.\n\nWoltemade is very much a technical footballer, you only have to look at his goal against Brighton, the penalty against Nottingham Forest and his second in the 2-2 draw with Chelsea to know that this guy has incredible technique.\n\nThere are other moments of pure genius as well that show, with the right structure, Newcastle would get the best out of Woltemade.\n\ntalkSPORT understands that the Magpies are willing to sell Woltemade in the summer, which would be a mistake.\n\nEven if you don't rate him, Anthony Elanga and Yoane Wissa have so far contributed a lot less than the 6ft 6ins German.\n\nThe likes of Antony, Nicolas Pepe, and Ali Dia are somewhere breathing an almighty sigh of relief if Woltemade is the worst-ever top-flight signing.\n\nAnd forget about Premier League history, even just in Newcastle history, I can think of one signing who was far worse - Michael Owen.\n\nOwen was the Toon's record signing at the time, he spent the majority of it injured and never even wanted to be there.\n\nWoltemade has embraced life on Tyneside in every way, and for that alone, he's better than Owen.\n\nRegarding finding a place for him in the team, that is on Howe because he is at St James' Park now, and if you have to change the system to accommodate him, so be it because it would be a step in the team's evolution.\n\nHe has the ability and vision to unlock defences because we've seen it, and ultimately, Newcastle will win more games with him in the side than without.\n\nWoltemade probably won't turn out to be the Isak replacement, but for a club-record fee, the club have a supremely talented player who will prove everyone wrong.\n\nStarting with our very own Adrian Durham."

            "content": "Arsenal may have seen their lead at the top of the Premier League standings cut to just two points by the time they welcome London rivals Chelsea to the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.\n\nThe Gunners have led the way since early October, but they have been coming under increasing pressure from Manchester City over recent weeks, with the Citizens travelling to Leeds for Saturday's evening kick-off.\n\nChelsea are also in need of the points as the battle to secure Champions League football for next season intensifies. The Blues head into the weekend fifth following disappointing draws in their last two league games against Leeds and Burnley.\n\nGET UP TO £30 WHEN YOU BET ON THE FOOTBALL WITH talkSPORT BET\n\nArsenal to win, both teams to score, Gyokeres to score and Chelsea most cards - was 31/4 now 9/1\n\nLeg one: Arsenal to win\n\nThe pressure appeared to be mounting on Arsenal following a run of just two wins in seven league games prior to last weekend's north London derby, but that 4-1 thrashing of Spurs is likely to have settled some of those nerves.\n\nMikel Arteta's side should certainly be confident of overcoming Chelsea, as they are unbeaten in the last 10 meetings between the two sides across all competitions and have only lost one of the last 15 head-to-heads.\n\nThe Gunners beat the Blues home and away in the EFL Cup semi-finals just last month and their recent record in London derbies cannot be overlooked, as they have lost just one of their last 25 Premier League games against fellow teams from the capital.\n\nWith Chelsea having dropped points in their last two games against Leeds and Burnley, Liam Rosenior's honeymoon period in the Stamford Bridge hotseat could well be over and the league leaders can capitalise on that by picking up all three points.\n\nLeg two: Both teams to score\n\nArsenal built much of their early-season success on a strong defence, conceding just three goals across their opening 10 league games, but that rearguard has been penetrated with much more regularity over recent weeks.\n\nThe Gunners have conceded in 12 of their last 18 top-flight games, including each of their last three, and they will be facing a Chelsea side who have only failed to score in two of their previous 41 fixtures.\n\nBoth teams to score has been a winning bet in each of Chelsea's last five league games and that trend can continue in north London.\n\nLeg three: Viktor Gyokeres to score anytime\n\nViktor Gyokeres had arguably his best game in an Arsenal shirt during last week's north London derby, grabbing a brace to take his tally for the season in the Premier League to 10, while it is 15 overall for the Sweden international since his summer arrival from Sporting CP.\n\nThere has been plenty of scrutiny surrounding Gyokeres since he pitched up at the Emirates, but with five goals across his last five Premier League games, he appears to be finding his feet.\n\nThe 27-year-old also has previous against Chelsea, grabbing a goal and an assist in the first leg of last month's EFL Cup semi-final tie.\n\nLeg four: Most cards: Chelsea\n\nDiscipline, or a lack of it, has been a problem for Chelsea this season, as they have picked up a league-high six red cards (seven if you include the one handed to former boss Enzo Maresca), the latest of which came against Burnley last weekend.\n\nOnly two teams - Spurs and Brighton - have received more yellows than the Blues total of 60, while Arsenal's tally of 38 is among the lowest in the division and they are yet to have a player sent off.\n\nIn November's reverse meeting at Stamford Bridge the hosts had Moises Caicedo dismissed and, in a game where they are expected to be on the backfoot for large spells, the Blues could rack up plenty of cards once again.\n\nGET UP TO £30 WHEN YOU BET ON THE FOOTBALL WITH talkSPORT BET\n\nOdds correct at time of publish and subject to change*\n\n18+ New customers only.

He has also shown a preference for playing this Leeds side, scoring twice in his three career matches against the Whites.\n\nSemenyo is a dangerous customer and is fancied to get on the scoresheet in this clash.\n\nBrendan Aaronson to score at anytime\n\nWhile Dominic Calvert-Lewin has taken most of the headlines, Brendan Aaronson has been quietly one of most impressive players in Daniel Farke’s lineup.\n\nHe has four goals in the Premier League and three assists but arguably his most impressive statistic is his 0.73 shots on target per 90 minutes.\n\nAaronson is particularly dangerous on the counter, where Manchester City have been vulnerable, and he is a tempting price to find the net against the visitors.\n\nGET UP TO £30 WHEN YOU BET ON THE FOOTBALL WITH talkSPORT BET\n\nOdds correct at time of publish and subject to change*\n\n18+ New customers only.

            "content": "THE mother of a 17-year-old killed in a drug-driving horror crash says no jail term is long enough for the man who killed her “best friend.”\n\nKeilan Roberts, then 21, had taken ketamine, cocaine, ecstasy and had been drinking when he killed passenger Chloe Hayman in Fochriw, South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the car hit a cattle grid, a railing pierced the windscreen and tragically killed Chloe instantly.\n\nChloe’s bereaved mother has called for young people to learn from the tragedy, and even hugged the man who killed her, according to the BBC.\n\nDevastated Danielle O’Halloran, 37, from Mountain Ash, said Chloe was her best friend and someone who “always saw the good in everyone.”\n\nRoberts had met Chloe in a nightclub just hours before and offered her a lift home with his friends.\n\n\n\nHe had intended to drop Chloe off the following morning but changed his mind and asked his pals to leave him and Chloe where his Skoda Octavia was parked.\n\nHours after the crash, Danielle was told the news — a moment she described as “too painful to relive.”\n\nShe said: “Your body can’t cope with the fact that they’re not there.\n\n“Like at that moment, I was just in shock.”\n\n\n\nRoberts, from Rhymney, Caerphilly county, admitted four charges linked to Chloe’s death.\n\nFootage captured on the bodycam of a police officer after the crash shows the immediate aftermath of the horror smash.\n\nRoberts can be seen standing on the side of the road, looking dazed and confused while holding a Peroni bottle.\n\n\n\nIn June 2023, he was sentenced, and following a family appeal, his prison term was increased to five years and three months with a 12-year driving ban.\n\nChloe’s mum had slammed Robert’s jail term as an “insult” after losing her “kind, loving, beautiful” daughter.\n\nDanielle said she was consumed by anger and hate: “I wished so many bad things upon him, I wanted him to stay there forever.\n\n“But I felt ill inside with the amount of anger I had. I just couldn’t let it eat me up any more.”\n\nThrough the restorative justice process, Danielle met Roberts, who was then 22, in prison — hugging him and confronting the man who took her daughter’s life.\n\n\n\nShe said: “We were both emotional when he walked in.”\n\nMeeting him face to face, Danielle says she realised that he had not meant to kill her daughter, but was “just a 21-year-old” who had made the “wrong choice.”\n\nNow, heartbroken Danielle hopes they can one day speak together in schools to warn young people about the devastating consequences of drink and drug driving.\n\nShe said: “I want young people to understand the lives that are shattered by one wrong choice.\n\n\n\nNo jail term is ever going to be long enough for what he did.”\n\nShe added: “I hugged him and said, I’m sorry you’re the one who has to live with this.”\n\nDanielle believes no jail sentence can outweigh the lifelong regret and guilt Roberts now carries.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Coming back into the community is actually harder because you have to face people,” she said.\n\n\n\nShe added that society must do more to prevent risky behaviour, provide community support, and protect young people from the “glamorisation” of drinking and dangerous choices."

            "content": "SPOTTING Saul Murray’s flashy designer watch on Instagram, scheming Surpreet Dhillon quickly devised a deadly plot to steal it, luring in her victim with the promise of sex before he was drugged and killed.\n\nNow behind bars, she is seemingly just one of a growing number of women prepared to act as bait for gangs, as one expert exclusively reveals to The Sun why “honey-trapping” is becoming such a popular tactic used among criminals to target unsuspecting prey.\n\n\n\nFor victim Saul, 33, it was flashing his seemingly expensive timepiece online which made him a target to Dhillon, 36, who flirted with him on social media before arranging to meet him for sex with accomplice Temidayo Awe, 21.\n\nThe women headed to Saul’s flat in Luton, Beds, where they drank brandy before “sexual activity” occurred, and Dhillon secretly laced Saul’s glass with a date rape sedative to “knock him out”.\n\n\n\nWhen that didn’t work, male accomplices Ikem Affia, 31, and Cleon Brown, 29, were seen entering the property on CCTV brandishing a knife.\n\nTragically, his body was found in his block of flats the following day, after dying as a result of heavy bleeding from a stab wound to his thigh, which had pierced an artery.\n\nAnd it was all for nothing as the “Rolex” watch the dad-of-six was targeted for was later revealed to be fake.\n\nCriminology professor David Wilson says he has increasingly heard more and more cases like this, where honey-trapping is utilised as a method to hoodwink unwitting victims.\n\nHe explains: “Honey trapping is essentially a form of fraud. You’re presenting yourself as something that you’re not, in the hope that you’ll encourage a relationship to develop.\n\n\n\n“You’re going to present yourself in the most ‘ideal’ form you possibly can – having attributes and personal qualities or a personality that you know will culturally be attractive to the person that you’re trying to trap.\n\n“There is a stereotypical view that women will be less dangerous than men.\n\n“By and large, people would trust a woman rather than a man, so using a young woman as bait would be seen as easier than using a young man by a criminal gang.\n\n“There is always a hare and tortoise race going on when we talk about a crime and the police – the hare is the offender, and the tortoise is the criminal justice system.\n\n“Basically, the justice system hasn’t fully caught up to that technique yet. When they do, the [criminals] will move on [to another technique].”\n\n\n\nFor her role in the botched plot, Dhillon, from East London, was sentenced to ten years for manslaughter and conspiracy to commit robbery at Luton Crown Court, but this is far from an isolated case.\n\n\n\n£30k ‘orgy’ robbery plot\n\nIn another horrifying example, Vishal Gohel, 44, from Bushey, Herts, was expecting to have sex with three women in January 2022 before he was murdered.\n\nGeorgia Bruce-Annan, a 22-year-old Coutts Bank apprentice, first made contact with Vishal on classifieds site Craigslist before arranging the bogus liaison.\n\nDad-of-two Vishal was seen on a shop’s CCTV buying drinks, cigarettes and condoms ahead of the meet, borrowing £100 in cash from his mother and withdrawing £100 from a cash machine.\n\nBruce-Annan, who joked Vishal was her “sugar daddy” and Faith Hoppie, 22, headed to the victim’s property in a plot to rob him of possessions totalling £30,000.\n\nThey later let Tevin Leslie, 23, Sakeen Gordon, 22, and Brandon Browne, 23, into the home and when Vishal could or would not transfer them any cash, he was fatally beaten and throttled.\n\n\n\nIt’s a method that criminals use because it elicits quick compliance — the victim doesn’t see the threat coming until it’s too late. Dr Daniel Glazer ,\n\nThe next morning, Vishal’s neighbour found him lifeless on his bedroom floor, with gaffer tape around the lower part of his face.\n\nHis watch, the £200 cash and his iPhone had been stolen and a post-mortem found he had suffered a significant blow or blows to the head.\n\nBruce-Annan, from East London, received a life sentence for murder at St Albans Crown Court and Hoppie, from East London, was sentenced to eight years for manslaughter and conspiracy to rob.\n\nThe promise of a “sexual transaction”, David says, is “instrumental” in many cases like this.\n\nHe adds: “It’s a means to an end, to get access to more resources – the victim’s home for example, and the victim’s life. It’s very invasive. The victim has exposed themselves as who they are to somebody they believe was being honest.\n\n\n\n“That has a huge psychological impact in terms of their willingness to trust somebody again – and relationships are about trust at the end of the day. The stakes are actually incredibly high emotionally and psychologically.”\n\nClinical psychologist Dr. Daniel Glazer adds: “Most often, the victim is being promised a desired personal reward or fantasy.\n\n“It’s a method that criminals use because it elicits quick compliance — the victim doesn’t see the threat coming until it’s too late.”\n\nIt’s a horrifying scenario playing out in incidents across the country.\n\nIn Birmingham, gleeful Shannon Wolleter acted as bait so she could join her boyfriend and his two pals in launching a vile assault on their supposed friend, charity worker Anthony Cooper.\n\n\n\nThis honey trap plot wasn’t for money in this case, it was for revenge – the gang believed Anthony owed them £150 and disapproved of his partner.\n\n\n\nAfter pretending she was romantically interested in Anthony, Woolleter, 30, arranged to meet him for sex before texting her boyfriend Daniel Aston, 33, saying “got him”.\n\nIn a terrifying ordeal lasting four hours, Anthony was beaten by Steven Baker, 61, with his son Matthew Baker, 29, threatening to cut off his legs.\n\nThe gang also threatened to chop off their victim’s tongue, stamped on his genitals and struck him with an iron bar in the October 2021 attack.\n\nHoney trapper Wolleter, from Wilts, was sentenced to two years and ten months behind bars for kidnap and unlawful wounding.\n\nIn another revenge plot, Mundill Mahil was convicted in 2012 of grievous bodily harm with intent for her part in the killing of a TV executive and given six years inside, of which she served three.\n\n\n\nShe was found to have lured Gagandip Singh, 21, to her student flat in Brighton pretending she wanted to talk to him.\n\nInstead, two men waited for him in her bedroom, viciously beating him before leaving him to die in the boot of his burning car in 2011.\n\nWhile Mahil argued she had no idea he was in danger, prosecutors argued the motivation in this case was revenge after Mahil claimed he had previously attempted to rape her.\n\n\n\nHarinder Shoker, 20, was given a life sentence for murder and Darren Peters, also 20, was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter.\n\nMahil, then just 19, was jailed for six years.\n\nAfter her release she married a leading Labour councillor Varinder Singh Bola who was forced to quit as a mayor-elect of Redbridge, London when her previous convictions emerged.\n\nWhether they’re successful plots or not, using women as bait to lure in victims is a typically a carefully orchestrated crime.\n\nDavid says: “This isn’t random. It’s very constructed and carefully thought through. Fraudsters like this are very ‘good’ because they do their homework.\n\n\n\n“They are looking at the sorts of things that [victims] post on their social media, on their facebook page.\n\n“They are listening very carefully or reading very carefully and interpreting how you write about yourself and the kind of person that you might be seeking.”\n\nTeen honey-trapper\n\nTake Roani da Silva Sampaio, for example, who knew exactly how to portray herself to lure in exactly who she was looking for.\n\nPosing in a bikini on social media, she looked like she was living the influencer dream – but her lifestyle was simply bait for a high-stakes honey-trapping plot.\n\nAccording to reports, Sampaio was just 19 years old when she arranged to meet businessman Abel Landim for sex at his luxury apartment in Teresina, Brazil, in February 2021.\n\n\n\nWhile the temptress kept him busy in the shower, her boyfriend Francisco Moises Sousa Batista Jr and two accomplices broke into his property.\n\nTerrifying CCTV footage showed the three gang members kick down the door of the apartment before bursting into the home armed with a .38 revolver and an automatic pistol.\n\nBatista handcuffed victim Abel with plastic zip ties before beating him and holding a gun to his head for a terrifying game of Russian roulette, using a revolver with two bullets to terrify him into revealing where his valuables were stashed.\n\nThe gang stole cash, cameras, valuables and plundered the businessman’s bank accounts after forcing him to hand over his passwords and PINs.\n\n\n\nIncredibly, stricken Abel managed to call the cops as they ransacked his home, with the honey trapper and her boyfriend arrested on the spot.\n\nSampaio was jailed for 23 years and four months, while the three men – Batista, Jean Carlos and Thiago Ruan Martins de Sousa – were caged for 20 years.\n\nFrom the promise of a romantic relationship to a thrilling threesome, there’s no denying female honey trappers are currently seen as an easy way to gain the trust of innocent targets.\n\nBut, as David adds, nothing lasts forever – and as we become more aware of the techniques used by perpetrators, the less likely we are to fall victim.\n\n\n\nFinally he adds: “Honeytrapping will eventually fall out of fashion.\n\n“It will fall out of fashion because of articles like this – by drawing attention to it the public become more aware they have to be careful.\n\n“I always say if something looks too good to be true, it is too good to be true – you need to know the red flags.”"

            "content": "IN CUFFS Two teens arrested over ‘knife brawl’ at Scots Asda as cops probe ‘targeted attack’\n\nTWO teenagers have been arrested over an alleged knife brawl in front of terrified shoppers at a busy Scots Asda.\n\nArmed cops raced to the supermarket in Edinburgh after an alleged knife fight erupted around 4.20pm on Wednesday in the Jewel area of the capital, close to Niddrie.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice Scotland chiefs described it as a “targeted attack”.\n\nAnd it comes just days after a cop chief warned that those committing violence with knives in public risked being shot.\n\nVideo footage allegedly shows youths wielding weapons as they clash with petrol pumps in full view.\n\nOne onlooker was heard describing the scenes as “medieval”.\n\nAnd another said: “It was chaos and absolutely shocking to witness.\n\n“People were going about their shopping and then this kicks off – it’s an utter disgrace.”\n\nPolice Scotland said two arrests have been made.\n\nA statement said: “Two males aged 17 and 18 have been arrested and charged in connection with assault to endangerment of life, breach of the peace and weapons offences following a disturbance in The Jewel area of Edinburgh.\n\n\n\n“Around 4.20pm on Wednesday, February 25 officers were called to a report of males with weapons causing a disturbance.\n\n“There were no reported injuries.”\n\nChief Inspector Alison Macdonald said: “We are treating this as a targeted attack and extensive enquiries are continuing to trace others involved.\n\n“This type of violence is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”\n\nAsda was approached for comment.\n\n\n\nIt comes as two teenagers were charged last month for allegedly brandishing machetes in Edinburgh city centre.\n\n\n\nFirearms cops were scrambled to the scene on Rose Street last month two boys, aged 15 and 17, were charged.\n\nAnd across the country in Glasgow, police announced a new crackdown on marauding yobs terrorising the city centre.\n\nPolice chiefs will roll out a huge dispersal zone in Scotland’s biggest city.\n\nCops will be given the green light to order sinister mobs away from key areas amid an alarming spike in trouble linked to menacing groups involved in violence, drug deals, shoplifting and brazen drug abuse.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nEarlier this month, Scottish Police Federation boss David Kennedy – whose organisation represents rank and file cops – warned knife thugs they could be shot by officers.\n\n\n\nHe said: “If you produce a knife in Scotland, if you walk out into the street in Scotland with a knife, you should expect to be shot by the police because the reality is that’s a lethal weapon you’re holding.”"

            "content": "EMILE MYSTERY Five unanswered questions in Emile Soleil murder riddle from crucial 15 mins before vanishing to sudden mass DNA test\n\nMAJOR questions still hang over the death of toddler Emile Soleil more than two years after he disappeared.\n\nThe two-year-old vanished from his grandparents’ isolated holiday home in the French Alps on July 8, 2023 – and was found dead 266 days later.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis remains, including a fractured skull, were discovered in March 2024 by a rambler just 25 minutes from the Alpine hamlet of Haut-Vernet, south of Grenoble.\n\nProsecutors say he suffered “violent facial trauma” and claim his body was moved after death.\n\nNow, with locals reportedly being asked to give DNA samples in a huge new testing drive, five huge questions still hang over the case.\n\n\n\nWhy DNA testing three years after disappearance?\n\nIn a dramatic new development, cops have launched a mass DNA testing effort in Haut-Vernet.\n\nAround 100 villagers will reportedly have samples taken as detectives hunt what they believe could be the toddler’s killer.\n\nEmile’s grandparents, Philippe and Anne Vedovini, both 59, had their DNA taken at the start of the investigation.\n\nInvestigators have revealed the body had been moved when the child was already dead.\n\n\n\nEven more chillingly, Emile had not died in the clothes he was wearing when he was discovered.\n\nPublic prosecutor Jean-Luc Blachon said: “These elements allow us to consider that the body did not remain in the same place and in the same biotope during the decomposition process.”\n\nThe decomposition reportedly suggests the body may have been preserved in a protected environment, such as a freezer.\n\nThe fact his remains were found in an area already thoroughly searched has fuelled claims someone brought him back.\n\nIs the DNA sweep a sign detectives believe the answer lies within the tiny Alpine community?\n\n\n\nWhy were grandparents arrested?\n\nEmile’s grandparents were dramatically arrested in dawn raids along with two of their adult children – identified as the boy’s aunt and uncle.\n\nAll four faced charges of ‘intentional homicide’ and ‘concealing a corpse’, according to a statement from Aix-an-Provence prosecutors.\n\n\n\nThey were quizzed for 17 hours but later released.\n\nLead prosecutor Jean-Luc Bachon said the charges were “not sufficient to warrant an indictment”.\n\nHe added that all four had answered questions “put to them”.\n\nEnquiry sources confirmed the grandparents were detained following months of police wire taps.\n\nConversations between them and other family members were secretly listened to.\n\n\n\nPhilippe Vedovini is also under investigation in an entirely separate case relating to alleged sexual abuse at a Roman Catholic school in the 1990s.\n\nHe has always denied the claims and insisted he did nothing wrong.\n\nWhy did priest who baptised Emile ‘die by suicide’?\n\nIn another shocking twist, Father Claude Gilliot, who baptised Emile, allegedly died by suicide in recent weeks.\n\nThe 85-year-old reportedly left a suicide note when he was found after “a massive overdose”, according to an investigation source.\n\nThe priest had been close to Emile’s grandparents but is believed to have fallen out with them in recent years.\n\n\n\nHe even provided a photo of Emile to the media when the boy was missing – only to be condemned by the family.\n\nThe Vedovini family later boycotted his chapel.\n\nHis death has stunned locals, as under Catholic teaching, suicide is viewed as a mortal sin on par with murder.\n\nPolice have not publicly linked his death to the investigation.\n\nWhy was Emile left alone before disappearance?\n\nOn the day he vanished, Emile was last seen with his grandfather.\n\n\n\nPhilippe later admitted he had left the toddler alone in the garden during what he described as “fifteen minutes of inattention”.\n\nTwo witnesses claimed they saw the child wandering alone while Philippe was chopping wood.\n\nA source close to the investigation told La Depeche the pair who “confirmed that they saw the child walking alone at the time of his disappearance” are “reliable people” who they “trust completely”.\n\nEmile was wearing a yellow top, white shorts with a green pattern, and hiking shoes.\n\nHis parents were not in the village at the time.\n\n\n\nWhy did it take 266 days to find remains?\n\nEmile’s remains were discovered 266 days after he vanished – in an area already searched by cops, soldiers, sniffer dogs, volunteers, helicopters and drones.\n\nHow was he not found sooner?\n\n\n\nProsecutors confirmed the remains had been moved just before they were discovered.\n\nBlachon also said Emile’s body did not decompose in the clothes he was found in.\n\nLocals previously floated a wolf attack theory.\n\nOne person told Le Parisien at the time: “The little one must have been the victim of an animal. And I only see the wolf as the culprit.\n\n“They say wolves are afraid of people, but with a little boy like that, a big boy, the wolf would have seen him as another prey.”\n\n\n\nFrançois Balique, the mayor of Vernet, also reportedly appeared to believe the theory.\n\nBut the evidence now appears to point elsewhere.\n\nIt comes as disturbing background details about the family have also emerged.\n\nEmile’s father, Colomban, was arrested in 2018 over an alleged “attack on foreigners” before being released after agreeing to maintain the peace.\n\nHe was reportedly linked to Action Francaise and the neofascist Bastion Social.\n\n\n\nThree years later, he and Emile’s mother stood in a local election and were said to support Éric Zemmour.\n\nMeanwhile, Philippe Vedovini was previously implicated as an “assisted witness” in an enquiry into alleged abuse at the Riaumont boarding school in Pas-de-Calais.\n\nIn 2018, he admitted to administering “somewhat harsh” physical discipline but has always denied breaking the law.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nDespite the arrests, the raids, the wire taps and now the sweeping DNA dragnet, no one has been charged over Emile’s death.\n\nThe investigation continues."

I was sitting and I fell to the ground, along with the other passengers. It was terrible.\n\n“The man next to me was bleeding from his head. It took me a while to get up and get off.”\n\nAnother passenger said: “We heard something down below, then the tram derailed, and we were all thrown around. The tram veered, picked up speed, and hit a building.”\n\nIt is not yet known why the tram came off the tracks near the centre of the northern Italian city, which is currently hosting its Fashion Week, although reports have suggested the tram took a sharp turn too quickly.\n\n\n\nEmergency medical services, including six ambulances and a medic car, scrambled to the scene.\n\nFirefighters managed to extract passengers from inside the tram. Their conditions are currently unclear.\n\nCivil protection teams have set up a tent to assist the injured.\n\nAuthorities have launched a probe to investigate the cause of the tragedy.\n\nThe incident involved a Tramlink tram, which can carry a maximum of 66 passengers.\n\n\n\nStretching to 82 ft long, the trams consist of three connecting carriages.\n\nThey form a new fleet purchased by local transport company ATM, which has invested £160million.\n\n\n\nA total of 74 Tramlink trams entered service in Milan on February 20.\n\nThey are expected to replace the older trams over the next two years.\n\nATM has not made an immediate comment.\n\nIt came after a tragic funicular crash hit another European city last year.\n\n\n\nTragedy struck the Portuguese capital of Lisbon when its famous funicular derailed while packed full of passengers on September 3 2025, killing 16.\n\nThe Gloria Funicular – one of the Portuguese capital’s most iconic attractions – came off its tracks after a cable reportedly came loose.\n\nThe tram sped down the street out of control before smashing into the building on the bend at full speed and seemingly without brakes.\n\nWitnesses described the car crumpling like a “cardboard box” when it hit the wall.\n\nDozens sprinted up the steep road to find the car had flipped on its side and was torn apart into splintered metal.\n\n\n\nDistressed onlookers can be heard screaming “there’s kids under there” seconds after the cable car with tourists on board derailed and smashed into a hotel.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThree Brits were among the 16 victims, while another 20 were injured.\n\nA report into the crash details a litany of failures and noted that the underground cable was defective and had never been certified for passenger transportation."

She later said she grew up \"loving the oak trees\" around their home, and they were the inspiration for her 2020 children's book, The Enchanted Oak Tree.\n\nView 3 Images Sarah and Andrew opened the Dummer village fete in July 1989 (Image: Mirrorpix)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDocuments released from the Epstein files included several email exchanges between Fergie and Epstein, who was found dead in his jail cell in 2019, and showed that their friendship lasted longer than she had previously claimed.\n\nIt also emerged that she had discussed meeting up with Epstein for lunch - with daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie - shortly after he was released from prison in 2009 for soliciting sex from underage girls.\n\nAccording to Ingrid, who has known Fergie since before she married Andrew in 1986, there is every chance she is still hoping the situation will blow over and she can return to something resembling her old life.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"She has a massively endearing type of personality,\" she said. \"It's a tragedy that her bad side has got the stronger hold over her than her good side. So the bad side is the greed, the stupidity and obsessively wanting things. She desperately, desperately wants to be liked.\"\n\nView 3 Images Sarah described sex trafficker Epstein as 'the brother I have always wished for' in one exchange (Image: AP)\n\nShe continued, \"[She has] an inability to connect with reality - but I suppose she’s connecting with reality now - or maybe she’s not. Maybe she’s literally got her head in the sand thinking, 'this will all go away'. And it’s not impossible in a way, if Andrew isn’t convicted of a crime.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nFergie's ex Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, meanwhile, has been keeping less of a low profile and has been photographed in public a number of times over the last month, including on one occasion while he was horse riding in the grounds around Royal Lodge, shortly before his eviction. He was also seen on the day of his arrest by Thames Valley Police on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\n\nThe former Duke of York spent 11 hours in custody at Aylsham police station in Norfolk on what was his 66th birthday - February 18 - and was photographed looking somewhat dishevelled in the backseat of a car as he was driven back to Sandringham."

She says: “I think I was a good mum. I've been a rotten grandmother though.” Even since her decision to quit the ever popular Channel 4 show last month after nine years, she says: “I still don’t spend enough time with them. When I look at my fellow grandmothers, they live for their grandchildren. They shower them with attention, remembering all their birthdays. I fail utterly.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"What do I bring to the table? Occasionally I give the children cooking lessons. My husband has a great method of attracting them to our house - he buys really dangerous toys, trikes, motorbikes, no stabilisers. They come for the danger… and stay for us - and lunch.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNow 86, Dame Prue has five grandchildren, 11 if combined with those of her husband, John Playfair, 72, who she met in 2011 and married in 2016. She has two children, a biological son, Danny Kruger, 51, and an adopted daughter from Cambodia, Li-Da Kruger, 50, from her marriage to her first husband, Rayne Kruger. They were together for 30 years before his death, aged 80, in 2002.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNever before seen intimate pictures of Lorraine Kelly as her daughter opens up family album READ MORE :\n\nShe is now “very much in love and happily married” to retired fashion designer and tailor John and discusses their romance and more in her new book, Being Old and Learning to Love it, which is out now. She says: “I’d be quite happy to talk about love in old age, if I could keep some of it private. But, inevitably, people want to know about sex. How many times a year, a month? I’m not careful, I'm very indiscreet and my instinct is to tell anyone anything they want to know. But I get myself into trouble. I’m so egotistical!”\n\nView 6 Images Alison Hammond, Noel Fielding, Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood (Image: Channel 4 / Love Productions)\n\nAs well as brushing up on her grandparenting skills, Dame Prue is keen to spend plenty of time holidaying, now she’s quit Bake Off. She says: “One of the chief reasons I gave up is because it’s filmed in the summer. I want a European summer holiday. I’m South African, I have to get near the sun. I’ve had lovely holidays in Africa, Australia. But I suddenly realised I might never have another holiday in Spain, or Italy, France, or Greece. I’ve cajoled the whole family to come away with me this summer.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOne family member unlikely to be invited is her new Main Coon cat called Sophisticat, or Sophie for short. Displaying hands that have been scratched to pieces, she laughs: “My birthday present from John. I’ve got a kitten now who is an escape artist, and has the sharpest claws in the world and loves to play. I’m completely shredded.\n\n“I’ve been texting Paul Hollywood non stop because he and his wife Mellissa have two Maine Coon cats too. He was the only person I told [she was leaving]. We’re such good friends and we’ve been a double act all this time - he needed to know first.”\n\n6 View 6 Images Prue Leith and John Playfair (Image: Getty Images for Pimm's) 6 View 6 Images Cook, writer and broadcaster Prue Leith (2nd-L), with daughter Li-Da Kruger (L), her son Danny Kruger and his wife Emma pose after she became a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRemaining in constant contact with Paul, she has been touched by the positive reaction to her departure. She says: “Nobody has said ‘good riddance’ - not one person! It’s extraordinary - it’s a cake show for goodness sake. There have been waves and waves of distress at my leaving, which is complete nonsense.”\n\nVery fond of her replacement, Nigella Lawson, 66, she says: “She’s terrific.” But Dame Prue, who invites film crews into her Cotswolds home for the popular ITV show Prue Leith’s Cotswold Kitchen, is not retiring yet. She says: “I love filming at home - I barely need to get out of bed,” quips Prue. “And I get to spend time with John, who tells me I’m too busy and never stop, which to some extent is true. I do like being busy.”\n\nDressed in characteristically colourful bold striped trousers and matching specs, she adds: “My husband buys all my clothes. He’s got great taste.” With her inspiring joie de vivre, fans may be surprised to hear that, at any given moment, Dame Prue is probably thinking about death. She says: “I think about death a lot. I look ahead and see death. Funnily enough I think it’s something that old people do.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 6 Images Prue with late husband Rayne and adopted daughter Li-Da (Image: Prue Leith)\n\n“I never thought about it in my 60s, but now it pops into my head most days. Just passing thoughts. The world is going to hell in a hand cart. Either AI will see us off, or war. I was born during the Second World War, and when it stopped we had 70/80 years of peace. But I think, ‘Oh well I won't be here - let them carry on.’ It’s quite comforting - I won't have to worry about that. I don’t have long left. Ten years if I’m lucky. I need to use them well.”\n\nA keen advocate for assisted dying, while she is still “relatively healthy,” to the horror of her MP son, she has decided exactly how she’d like to go. She says: “I would like to go in my bed, surrounded by my family, at a time of my choosing. “When I’ve had enough, I just want to be able to take some drug, have someone inject me with something or other, and plan it.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I want to be ready, I won't be frightened, my family will know what I’m doing, there will be no surprises, nobody is going to have to find me dead in a heap or something. I’m up against some really strong opposition. My son leads the opposition. And he’s an incredibly formidable opponent. But I think assisted dying, while it might sound extreme, is sensible. A lot of people have an absolutely horrible death, and unnecessarily so.”\n\n6 View 6 Images The Mirror's Hannah Britt meets Prue Leith 6 View 6 Images Hannah and Prue\n\n‌\n\n\n\nShe blames opposition to choosing when to die on serial killer Harold Shipman. She says: “Harold Shipman - I bet you didn’t think we’d be talking about him this afternoon - changed everything, because he killed a lot of old ladies. But it’s possible to have a good death. Lots of countries have passed this law and nobody has ever tried to rescind it. Four per cent of people in Canada are dying now in this way, and I think it's proof that it’s a popular bill. I wouldn't be surprised if it was 50% when word gets around how much nicer it is. I feel quite strongly about it.”\n\nYet, despite all the talk of death, Prue isn’t planning to go quite yet. In fact, she isn’t even considering settling into her dotage. She says: “I don’t like the word ‘retire’. But then I have always loved to work. Though I’m rather hoping this book will be my last. It’s amazing to be 86. It’s a vast old age and I’m quite astonished to be there. People think of old age as such a tragedy. But, honestly, for a lot of people it’s just like the rest of life.\n\n“I have no reason to be unhappy. If I wasn’t happy I think it would be disgracefully ungrateful, because I have all the things that make you happy. I’m comparatively healthy for my age. I sleep well. I eat well. I love well. I’ve had two happy marriages and the second one is still going strong. Both my children are fine, all my grandchildren are healthy. I’ve had a successful career. What is there to complain about? Nothing.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\n*Being Old and Learning to Love it by Prue Leith, published by Short Books £20, is out now"

Hard-right Reform candidate Matt Goodwin came second on 10,578 votes, followed by Labour's Angeliki Stogia on 9,364.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe victory - the Greens' first ever in a parliamentary by-election - triggered a wave of Labour anger as the party failed to defend a seat it won with a 13,413-vote majority in 2024. And there were recriminations over the decision by Labour chiefs to block Andy Burnham from standing in the race.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKey Green Party policies from drugs, Gaza and pay to scrapping nuclear weapons READ MORE :\n\nView 3 Images Hannah Spencer became the Green Party's fifth MP in the Commons (Image: Getty Images)\n\nMr Starmer struck a defiant tone, saying he would fight \"for as long as I've got breath in my body\" to help those who need change. But ex-Deputy PM Angela Rayner said the by-election defeat must be a “wake up call” for the Government. \"It's time to really listen - and to reflect,\" she said.\n\n\"Voters want the change that we promised - and they voted for. If we want to unrig the system, if we want to make the change we were sent into Government to make, we have to be braver.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"A Labour agenda that puts people first.\" Joanne Thomas, General Secretary of Usdaw, a union usually loyal to Mr Starmer, urged the Government to learn lessons.\n\n\"A majority of voters there do not feel that the Labour Government is providing the change they need, or the change the Labour Party committed to at the General Election,\" she said.\n\nView 3 Images Angela Rayner said the result must be a wake-up call (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I hope the Government reflects seriously on how it can regain that trust.\" Others went further, with Fire Brigades Union chief Steve Wright saying the party risked heavy losses at the May elections if it failed to \"change course immediately\".\n\nLabour MP Karl Turner, who has been critical of the PM's approach to criminal justice, said the result was “catastrophic”. He added: “Frankly the fact that Andy Burnham was blocked, who was the candidate who gave us our best chance, that's why we are where we are.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister described the result as \"very disappointing\" - but insisted he understood voters' frustration. He dismissed questions over whether he would resign, saying: \"I came into politics late in life to fight for change for those people who need it. \"I will keep on fighting for those people for as long as I've got breath in my body.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe PM also pledged to \"fight against extremes in politics\" on both sides that threatened to \"tear our country apart.\" In a letter to Labour MPs, Mr Starmer ramped up his attacks on Zack Polanski's party.\n\nHe said: “We will continue to warn of the risk the Greens pose: the risk of extreme policies like legalising all drugs and pulling out of Nato that most voters strongly reject, and the risk of splitting the progressive vote so that Reform come through the middle.” Behind the scenes, there was real fury over the Green victory.\n\nA Government source told the Mirror : “They are the new Lib Dems. Shape-shifting snake oil merchants playing opposition politics.\" The source also called for cool heads in Labour, saying: \"This is going to have an impact, of course, but we can’t view everything through the prism of one by-election.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Downing Street rebuffed calls to dramatically change course and said Labour must deliver for \"mainstream Britain\". A No10 source said: “We have a progressive manifesto which is popular with the public and we need to get on with the delivery. It’s not about copying the Greens platform.\n\n“There is always a problem in Government that there are distractions. But there is a meaty agenda that we need to shout about. “The most important thing is the cost of living and we have to keep going at that really hard rather than giving up to go down another alley.\"\n\nThe source added: “We have the Greens on one extreme and Reform on the other. We have a real opportunity to deliver for mainstream Britain.” Ms Spencer, who works as a plumber, offered an apology to her customers after she was elected as the Greens fifth MP.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIn her victory speech, she joked: \"I think I might have to cancel the work that you had booked in, because I'm heading to Parliament. And when I get there, I will make space for everyone doing jobs like mine, we will finally get a seat at the table.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old pledged to help those struggling with the cost of living as she said working hard \"used to get you something. She said: \"Instead of working for a nice life, we're working to line the pockets of billionaires. We are being bled dry.\n\n\"And I don't think it's extreme or radical to think working hard should get you a nice life.\""

This non-profit reportedly dished out £288,000 at the Imperial Peterhof luxury watch factory, per independent Russian news site Meduza.\n\nFBK also claimed some of that cash was spent on gymnastics camps but the anti-Putin group claimed it was a shield to allow the couples alleged kids a chance to play with other kids.

Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHowever, when they presented the note to the dead man's friends, it was quickly identified as 'Cadair Idris' - a mountain in Wales - written in his native Welsh . A source close to the family noted that Mr Williams was training for the Snowdon marathon at the time .\n\nThey described the error as one of several \"embarrassing failures\" in the police investigation, telling MailOnline: \"That just shows you how useless they were\" . Mr Williams was found naked inside the holdall, which had been fastened with a padlock from the outside, while the key was found underneath his body .\n\nThe flat, which is often used by intelligence staff, had the heating turned on full blast, despite it being the middle of summer, and there were no fingerprints found on the bag, padlock, or bath. In 2012, coroner Fiona Wilcox concluded that the death of Mr Williams, a GCHQ worker on secondment to MI6, was \"unnatural and likely to have been criminally mediated\" and that a third party may have been involved in moving the bag into the bath.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images CCTV image of Gareth Williams at Holland Park Tube station two days before his death (Image: PA)\n\nBut Scotland Yard concluded that Williams most likely died alone after accidentally locking himself inside the bag. A forensic review reopened in 2021 was closed in 2024, with police stating it identified no further lines of inquiry to disprove their main theory. To this day, critics cast doubt on the narrative that Mr Williams acted alone.\n\nConfined space rescue specialist Peter Faulding claimed he had tried \"300 times\" to replicate locking the bag from the inside without leaving forensic traces and failed, calling the police's solo-death theory a \"physical impossibility\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe told the Mail: \"My belief is that the bag was placed in the bath with Gareth dead already. Even if he could get in the bag, and even if he then padlocked it from the inside, there would be footprints and fingerprints all over the bath and the bag.\"\n\nThe Met Police told the Mirror today that while the force is not reopening the case, any new evidence will be reviewed by specialist detectives should it come to light, as is the case with all unexplained deaths.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with Gareth’s family who continue to grieve his loss. Since 2010, we have carried out extensive enquiries into Gareth’s death which has seen officers collect and review a significant amount of material and statements.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“As part of our investigation, officers also conducted a three-year forensic review. This was a thorough and in-depth process, which concluded in 2024 and identified no further lines of enquiry.\n\n“As with all unexplained deaths, any new information or evidence will be reviewed by specialist detectives should it come to light.”"

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren gives verdict on Conor Benn's split from Eddie Hearn - as he refuses to speak on his breakdown in relationship with Saudi backers\n\nFrank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980. The bout was competitive, but Arguello scored the 11th-round knockout to retain his WBC super featherweight title.\n\nCastillo would lose his next bout, too, dropping a unanimous decision to Mexican legend Salvador Sanchez after leading the first six rounds.\n\nCastillo later lost to Julio Cesar Chavez in 1985 as the iconic boxer scored a sixth-round knockout at the Forum in Los Angeles.\n\nRuben Castillo (L) throws a punch against Julio Cesar Chavez during the fight at the LA Forum\n\nBoxer Ruben 'the Conquistador' Castillo has passed away at 68, according to the World Boxing Council.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era. R.I.P.'\n\nCastillo ultimately served as an announcer alongside legendary play-by-play man, Chick Hearn.\n\n'Ruben and Chick Hearn were gold on Fights From The Fabulous Forum broadcasts,' one fan wrote online. 'Great stuff.'\n\nHe also had a reputation as a positive influence on many young fighters and fans.\n\n'A great man,' his nephew wrote on Facebook. 'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God.

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure.

Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "James Milner opens up on career-threatening injury that left him unable to lift his foot for SIX months last season - as he reveals future plans after breaking Premier League appearance record\n\nAs James Milner reflected on becoming the Premier League's record appearance holder last weekend, his mind may have wondered back to last season - when a milestone that has long seemed inevitable felt like a distant dream.\n\nMilner was expected to be sidelined for only a few weeks after limping out of a draw with Arsenal in August 2024. However, complications with a routine knee operation meant that six months later he was still unable to lift his foot or toes.\n\n'Things change quickly in football, especially when you get to my age,' Milner recalled at Brighton's training ground this week, speaking to a group of reporters at a briefing to mark his incredible achievement.\n\n'When I look at where I was last year, not being able to lift my foot for six months...\n\n'I think most people, including the surgeon, the physio and those who understood the injury thought I was finished at my age.'\n\nAfter an arduous, near nine-month recovery, the 40-year-old - who celebrated his record with characteristic humility - returned from the bench for the final minutes of Brighton's game at Tottenham on the last day of the season.\n\nJames Milner became the Premier League's record appearance holder (654) last weekend\n\nMilner is now in his 24th consecutive Premier League season and is a legend of the league (pictured as a 16-year-old during his debut campaign for Leeds back in 2002-03)\n\nThe determination, professionalism and resilience required to battle back from a career-threatening injury are hallmarks of a man who made the first of his 654 Premier League appearances as a 16-year-old for Leeds United on November 10, 2002. That was nearly three years before his current midfield colleague, Jack Hinshelwood, was born.\n\n'It was that desire to prove people wrong that probably means I'm still playing now,' added Milner, who managed only four appearances in 2024-25.\n\n'I wanted to prove that I could recover from the injury and not let my career end in a way that wasn't in my control.\n\n'It might still might happen, but that was the drive. I don't think many people believed I could return.'\n\nMilner, who surpassed his former England, Man City and Aston Villa team-mate Gareth Barry to claim the record, boasts a resume that includes 61 England caps and impressive spells at Leeds, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Man City, Liverpool and Brighton - plus a brief loan stint at Swindon as a 17-year-old.\n\nHis enduring popularity and respect within the game was evident in the tributes that poured in last Saturday, and you'd be hard pressed to find fans of any of his former clubs with a negative word to say about him.\n\nMilner admitted his phone 'blew up' with messages, including one exchange with Barry, who he credits for encouraging him to take up yoga during the latter part of his career.\n\nDespite his age, Milner remains in exceptional condition, with no grey hairs in sight. His triceps strain against his training top, though he jokes his ankles crack when he tries to sneak quietly into his children's rooms to kiss them goodnight.\n\nHe is engaging company too, frequently drawing laughter with his self-deprecating humour.\n\nMilner pictured with previous record holder Gareth Barry in 2005 during their Aston Villa days\n\nHe suffered a career-threatening injury last season but battled back to take the record\n\nMilner's desire to prove doubters wrong has been a recurring theme throughout his career.\n\nPerhaps most notably, when Graeme Souness - then Newcastle manager - loaned him to Aston Villa for the 2005-06 campaign, he said: 'You won't win the league with James Milners'.\n\nSouness was dismissed the following February and Milner has gone on to win three Premier League titles - twice with Man City and once with Liverpool, where he also lifted the Champions League.\n\nIn spite of his achievements, the motivation burns as strongly as ever in a player who has worked under 21 managers.\n\n'You always have your doubters no matter what you achieve,' added Milner, who credits his father Peter for instilling that mentality. 'You want to be the best, and proving people wrong has always been at the forefront of my mind.'\n\nThis week, Milner was presented with three Guinness World Records; the most Premier League appearances (654), most consecutive Premier League seasons played (24), and the longest period between a player's first and last Premier League goals (22 years and 248 days).\n\nMilner has won three Premier League titles despite previously facing doubts over his ability\n\nMilner said he is 'very open' to signing a new contract at Brighton and playing another season\n\nHe may now have his sights on surpassing Teddy Sheringham's record as the oldest outfield player in Premier League history (40 years and 272 days). Milner is currently 40 years and 54 days old.\n\nThe midfielder is out of contract this summer, although Brighton boss Fabian Hurzeler has expressed a desire to keep him for another season. So what does the future hold?\n\n'I'm very open to playing another year,' Milner explained. 'Whether I will or not, I'm not sure. I haven't had any conversations with the club yet and they have to want me as well.\n\n'Earlier in the season, I said let's get to February and see where we're at. We're there now, so we'll see what happens. I'm just doing my work every day, and hopefully the last few games showed I can still contribute on the pitch.'\n\nMilner is undecided about moving into coaching when he eventually hangs up his boots, saying he plans to rest and take a break first. He insists he doesn't fear retirement, though he may miss the structure of professional football and could turn to marathons to give himself a new challenge.\n\nAs the conversation draws to a close, Milner believes the best individual season of his career came at Aston Villa. He ranks being part of the beginning of Man City's era of dominance and helping restore Liverpool to glory as his proudest achievements.\n\nAbove all, however, Milner is grateful.\n\n'When I was younger, if there was a bad first half, there could be teacups flying and walls punched in the dressing room,' he said.\n\n'Things have changed, but there's so much good in the game now as well. I just feel fortunate and lucky that I've played through, and been a part of, two eras.'\n\n\n\nYou would be foolish to write Milner off just yet."

            "content": "Inside a private cinema room on the ground floor of a modern apartment block in Canary Wharf, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is enjoying something rarely afforded to professional footballers: a moment of peace and quiet.\n\nIt is his day off. Dressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, he sinks into a plush seat with the same composed demeanour that has defined his game. Afterwards, he says with a smile, the plan is simple: take a nap.\n\nThat understated presence has long shaped Wan-Bissaka’s identity, a player more comfortable letting performances speak for themselves than seeking attention. Now with West Ham after a formative spell at Manchester United, he is in reflective mood, revisiting a journey that has carried him from London estates to Old Trafford and back again.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, the story is as much about family and sacrifice as it is about football. Long before the bright lights of the Premier League, Wan-Bissaka’s football education began on the patch of grass outside his childhood home.\n\n'I was probably age five when I first fell in love with football,' he says. 'It was just me and my brother in the estate playing around with a ball. We would go out to the green opposite our house to play. We'd call it our Wembley.\n\n'It didn’t really click until around 16, when I realised there was a genuine chance of becoming a professional. That’s when I saw the opportunity to put my foot down and properly chase the dream.'\n\nDressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in reflective mood when he meets Daily Mail Sport\n\nThough Wan-Bissaka grew up idolising Thierry Henry, he has grown into a highly dependable, no-nonsense full back\n\nLike many London kids of his generation, his first football idol was Thierry Henry. 'I always wanted to be him,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'Honestly, I used to have this vision of me being him, and growing up to be that sort of player. He was my idol. I think it was because of his composure. He scored lots of goals but he also carried the team. He was a leader. My whole family were Arsenal fans when I was growing up, too.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s boyhood dream contrasts with his reputation as a no-nonsense defender, and the 28-year-old’s career was ultimately forged through family resilience and a demanding relationship with his father.\n\n'I didn't realise how much my parents were sacrificing for my dream to begin with,' he says. 'When I got into secondary school, which is the age when you start to want things like trainers and boots, I was quite demanding. But they would brush it aside and be like, \"You have to wait a couple of months\". That's when I realised that it wasn't easy for my parents to give me the things I was asking for.\n\n'They worked cleaning jobs to afford my boots and my dad would get in trouble for leaving work early to bring me to training.'\n\nHis father Ambrose’s influence came through discipline rather than praise. 'It was difficult because there was a language barrier between us. His English wasn't great and my French wasn't great so there were only a few words exchanged at times,' recalls Wan-Bissaka, who has now played nine times for the country of his father's birth, DR Congo. They will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica next month in FIFA's inter-confederation play-offs in Zapopan, Mexico, for a place at this summer's World Cup.\n\n'We mainly spoke about football. But he was always critiquing me or telling me what I could do better. It was never praise. I have to say, I found it confusing at the time. I always wondered why he wouldn't praise me. I used to question myself: \"Am I not doing enough?\"'\n\n'Even after I scored, I would come off the pitch and he wouldn't be pleased. I used to just think to myself, \"Is one goal not enough?\" But then as I got older I started to understand it. He just wanted me to test myself and become the best version of myself.'\n\nAfter taking to Premier League life with ease at Crystal Palace, where he won player of the year in his first full season in senior football, a £50million move to United soon followed. It was the biggest step of Wan-Bissaka's career - and one of the most challenging periods of his life.\n\nWan-Bissaka felt extremely homesick after making a big-money move to Manchester United. 'Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep,' he admits\n\nThe defender's positive relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a source of reassurance. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well,' says Wan-Bissaka of his former boss\n\n'When I moved to United, I really missed home, my family and friends especially,' he reveals. 'After training, I used to take the train back to London almost every day. It’s only about two hours, but it’s still a big commitment, and eventually it became exhausting, so I knew I had to stop.\n\n'It was something I wasn’t used to at all. I’d always been comfortable at home in London, surrounded by familiar people and places, so for everything to change overnight was difficult to adapt to. Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep. I struggled. It was probably the lowest I’d felt.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s big-money arrival from Palace in 2019 - which coincided with a first England call-up, though he was never capped due to injury - came with a mountain of expectation. But he quickly became a fixture in the United XI, starting more matches than any player across Europe’s top-five leagues in 2020-21.\n\nHis early relationship with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer offered reassurance amid his struggles off the pitch.\n\n'My relationship with Ole was good from the start,' he recalls. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well, and I think the rest of the players felt the same about him. He’s the kind of manager who backs you straight away. Once he gives you a job to do, it’s up to you to trust yourself and go out and deliver it.'\n\nManagerial turnover would later test that security, particularly under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.\n\n'Obviously, it’s football, every manager has their preferences,' he says. 'They might like you or they might not, and that’s just part of the game. When he (Rangnick) came in, it wasn’t the best period for me and there was a lot of criticism around…\n\n'It was difficult when Erik ten Hag arrived - as soon as he did, he told me I wasn’t in his plans. But when I tried to leave, he said he didn’t want me to go. I couldn't understand it. That was tough mentally, because it left me wondering what I was supposed to do next.\n\nWan-Bissaka initially struggled to gel as effectively with Solskjaer's successors, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag\n\nHis relationship with Ten Hag ultimately improved, and the pair lifted the Carabao Cup with United in 2023\n\n'I just kept my head down and told myself to keep training, keep improving, and play my game. Staying motivated was hard though, especially when you’re training without the clear goal of playing.\n\n'But the people around me guided me in the right way and encouraged me to keep going. Eventually things turned around and started to improve. You could say I changed or developed tactically under him, because that was something he wanted.'\n\nClarity, he says, is invaluable. And something the right back received from Michael Carrick. He speaks highly of United's recently-appointed interim boss, praising the simplicity of his messaging during his previous caretaker spell in 2021.\n\nNo wonder, then, that he backs Carrick to be given the permanent job after such an impressive start second time around.\n\n'He's someone you can trust,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'He will also trust you back if you buy into him and what he's looking to do. If you trust him, he will trust you.\n\n'He was quite simple in what he wanted from you. The boys were happy with him and the games he had when he was the manager. With him back at the club now, they are in a good place as a team. I think he should be given the full-time role. I think he deserves it.'\n\nIf Manchester represented pressure and growth, West Ham has provided renewal. The move back to London offered proximity to family and a fresh football environment.\n\nHis impressive form in his debut season saw him named 'Hammer of the Year' in May, beating out fan favourite Jarrod Bowen to the award.\n\nWan-Bissaka opens up to Daily Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly about his career - both the highs and the lows\n\n'At West Ham, I’ve been really happy with how things have been going,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'You can probably tell from the smile on my face'\n\nThough the club have struggled this season - sitting in the relegation zone with 11 games to go, despite an upturn in form under Nuno Espirito Santo - he has no regrets about making the move.\n\n'I was in two minds (about moving initially), to be honest,' he says. 'I had a year left on my contract, but I felt I needed to get back on my feet and start playing regularly - not just every couple of games.\n\n'Looking back on my time at Manchester United, I’m grateful for it. Those experiences made me who I am today and helped me both on and off the pitch, especially mentally.\n\n'With all the noise and scrutiny at a club like United, a change of environment can make a big difference. At West Ham, it’s not as intense… I’ve been really happy with how things have been going. You can probably tell from the smile on my face every day. I am playing with a smile too.'"

One user posted: 'Looks nothing like him,' accompanied by a laughing face emoji, while another wrote: 'Maybe to a blind person.'\n\nThe post has now been deleted from West Midlands Police's social media.\n\nThe real Gerrard, meanwhile, made his name with his midfield performances for club and country until his retirement in 2016.\n\nAfter he hung up his boots, he took up coaching, and has had spells with Rangers, Aston Villa and Al-Ettifaq.\n\nRecently, though, after little success in his last two jobs, he has been back on screen analysing games with the likes of TNT Sports.\n\nAs a player, he made 710 appearances for Liverpool, and a further 114 for England."

I will not do it forever. It was to have a social life.'\n\nThe Frenchman has also been battling depression and said it is something he has not 'fully' recovered from.\n\nA former team-mate of Mathieu, Loïc Loval-Landré, was able to help him find the job to get him out of the house and in a social environment.\n\nMathieu revealed: 'He knew I wanted to leave the house for a bit, I had been doing nothing for a while. We were chatting, and he told me there was a vacant position.'\n\nHe called time on his career after a nasty knee injury while playing for Sporting Lisbon at the age of 36 in 2020.\n\nMathieu came off the bench during Barcelona's Champions League final triumph against Juventus in 2015, helping his side to a 3-1 victory which confirmed an iconic Treble under former manager Luis Enrique.\n\nMathieu, pictured with Luis Suarez, also won two LaLiga titles during his three years at Barca\n\nAlthough he was primarily used as back-up for first team centre-halves Javier Mascherano and Gerard Pique, the Frenchman's versatility and experience was valued hugely by Enrique, who often used him as cover for Jordi Alba at left-back too.\n\nWhen asked about his time at the club, he reflected that his abiding memory was of Lionel Messi's genius.\n\n'Messi was incredible. In training, you couldn’t do anything. I think I was a better free-kick taker,' he added with a smile.\n\nDespite winning the majority of his honours at Barcelona, Mathieu played much of his career at fellow LaLiga outfit Valencia — where he made 177 appearances in all competitions."

            "content": "Opta supercomputer reveals the favourite to win the Champions League - as one Premier League club has a slim ONE per cent chance of glory after knock-out stage draw\n\nThe Opta supercomputer has confirmed that Arsenal remain the favourites to claim their maiden Champions League trophy after the final draw for the knockout stages of the competition took place on Friday morning.\n\nMikel Arteta's side - who are still Premier League frontrunners after navigating a challenging winter spell - are in contention for an unprecedented quadruple this season after a run of consecutive near-misses in recent years.\n\nWhile chasing the league remains a priority for many Gunners fans after successive second-place finishes, the chance to gain major European silverware for the first time is a tempting motivation for the squad as they enter the business end of the season.\n\nAnd following Friday's draw, chances of making the final in Budapest appear to have only intensified, after the north London team were drawn against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nShould they progress, their Blue pathway would see them then meet either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting Lisbon in the quarter-finals.\n\nTheir semi-final opponent could be one of the winners of either Newcastle versus Barcelona, or Atletico Madrid's meeting with Tottenham.\n\nArsenal remain on-track to break new ground at Europe's top table at the end of the season\n\nConveniently, the last 10 winners of the Champions League - Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid - are on the other 'Silver' pathway.\n\nDespite being drawn amongst a pack with a stronger European pedigree however, Bayern Munich are the closest contenders to spoil Arsenal's path, with Opta grading their 14.28 per cent chance of lifting the trophy second to the Gunners' 27.40 per cent chance.\n\nFans of the English game will be pleased to note that four of the top six clubs with the highest chance of claiming glory in Hungary are from the Premier League with Liverpool and Manchester City - who play Galatasaray and Real Madrid in the round of 16 respectively - the third and fourth-likeliest to win the Champions League.\n\nCHAMPION LEAGUE PREDICTIONS Arsenal - 27.40 per cent chance Bayern Munich - 14.28 per cent chance Liverpool - 12.83 per cent chance Man City - 10.79 per cent chance Barcelona - 7.72 per cent chance Chelsea - 6.86 per cent chance Newcastle - 4.66 per cent chance Paris Saint-Germain - 4.64 per cent chance Real Madrid - 2.78 per cent chance Sporting Lisbon - 2.73 per cent chance Atletico Madrid - 2.00 per cent chance Tottenham - 1.22 per cent chance\n\nLiverpool, who would then play the winner of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, have a 12.83 per cent chance, narrowly edging Man City, who have a 10.79 per cent chance.\n\nChelsea round out the cohort, with a significantly smaller 6.86 per cent chance, but the Blues will be confident heading into their match-up with the title-holders having beaten them roundly in the Club World Cup final last July.\n\nNewcastle just miss out on making the top six with their 4.66 per cent chance of winning the trophy, having navigated their way through a one-sided play-off match-up with Azerbaijan side Qarabag.\n\nThe remaining Premier League team still in play in Europe's top club competition, Tottenham, have a slender 1.22 per cent chance.\n\nIgor Tudor's injury-ravaged squad will likely throw full focus onto avoiding relegation one season on from winning the Europa League, with Atletico - who have a 2.00 per cent chance of winning the trophy - the favourites to make it into the quarter-finals.\n\nArsenal romped through the league phase to finish top of the table in the new-look model, with Liverpool, Man City, and Chelsea also qualifying automatically.\n\n\n\nOf the favourites for the title, only PSG were forced to endure a more arduous route to the round of 16, sneaking a win over two legs against Ligue 1 rivals Monaco 5-4 on aggregate."

It is understood that he moved forwards into the shaft without realising the car wasn't there.\n\nPavan is said to have sustained multiple injuries, revealing on Friday that he has had shoulder and back surgery, and a former coach has said he feels 'lucky to be alive.'\n\n'I would like to say a big thank you for all the kind words and wishes I have received over the last 48 hours,' Pavan said in a statement released by the DP World Tour. 'I had surgery on my shoulder and my back on Wednesday evening and I am currently recovering in hospital.\n\n'I now have a lot of rehab and hard work ahead of me, but the care I have received so far from the Mediclinic hospital staff has been incredible, as has the support from the DP World Tour, the Sunshine Tour and all their staff here in Stellenbosch. I am also very grateful for all the help Johann Rupert and his wife Gaynor have given me.\n\nHarrowing details have emerged of the freak incident that saw Italian golfer Andrea Pavan fall down a lift shaft\n\nPavan, pictured with his family, is said to have tumbled down two to three floors in the terrifying fall\n\n'The last two days have been difficult, but I am in very good hands and to have so many players, caddies and staff visit and contact me has meant a lot to me.\n\n'Grazie mille everyone, from me, my wife Audra, and my entire family.'\n\nJT Higgins, who is a former college coach of Pavan's, meanwhile, told Golf Channel: 'By all accounts, he's in good spirits, thankful to be alive and FaceTiming with his kids.'\n\nBoth players and friends are said to have visited the star in hospital, with his wife, Audra, travelling from Texas to be by his side.\n\n\n\nPavan's Texas A&M team-mate Matt Van Zandt has set up a GoFundMe page to help the expenses facing the Italian and his family, and said that he expects the golfer 'to remain in South Africa for many weeks before he can be safely evaluated for travel back to the U.S.'"

'I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.'\n\nUSA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-edited video posted by the White House\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the video, he added: 'It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying.\n\n'I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.'\n\nTrump also sparked controversy after footage of his phone call with the victorious men's team surfaced on social media.\n\nWhile congratulating them on winning gold, the President joked that he was also 'going to have to bring the women's team' to Washington after they also beat Canada in the final.\n\nTrump then added that he 'probably would be impeached' if he didn't extend the invitation to America's female hockey champions.\n\nThe women's team subsequently turned down Trump's invitation due to 'scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games.'\n\nAnd Tkachuk said he understood why they could have felt insulted by his locker-room joke, which some have labeled misogynistic.\n\n'I mean, I get it,' he said before detailing the positive relationship between the men's and women's teams. 'We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n'If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.'\n\nTkachuk was also accused by some of shouting 'Close the northern border!' during the congratulatory call with Trump, but he stressed: 'It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.'\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump announced that the USA women's team will still be visiting the White House at a later date despite rejecting his first invitation.\n\n\n\n'They beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw. As did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House,' he told Congress."

Player safety is still vital in that space so we’re going to remain vigilant around the safety aspect and what that contest in the air looks like. But there’s been a broad appreciation for the changes, the players have adapted brilliantly, and it’s opened up space in the game, so there’s no desire to change anything.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt had been reported in France that Australia and New Zealand were in favour of minimising the influence of scrums in matches but Robinson allayed fears of any imminent alterations at the set piece.\n\nHe added: “There’s be in no way any discussions about depowering the scrum. The principles of contest, and the primacy of contest is everything; the principles of all body shapes and sizes being able to take part. We had John Eales in the room this week towering over people, and we need a game that enables us all to be able to participate. That contest is at the heart of things.”\n\nGilpin and Robinson were speaking during a wide-ranging press conference during the Shape of the Game week, where an agreement has been made to focus more on the fan experience and a greater alignment in the application of law by officials at every level of the game.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nOther topics of discussion looked at how better to celebrate the sport and how to continue the growth of the women’s game.\n\nRobinson said: “The feedback from around the world is that the game on the field is broadly in a positive place. We’ve been guilty in the past of being too keen to play and tinker with laws. The message this week is to focus on better explaining, selling and celebrating our sport in what is an ever more competitive environment.\n\n“Our heritage and our values are strengths, and so too is our capacity to innovate. By continuing to enhance the rugby experience – how we present the game, how we tell our stories, how we connect with fans and how we protect our players – we will futureproof the sport and unlock even greater global relevance and value.”"

(Image: Ben Lumley)\n\nNottingham Forest might only be in the second year of their existence but skipper Niamh Cooper is already dreaming big.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn their first season in the Netball Super League, Forest were one of the surprise packages as they finished fifth, just three points off the semi-finals.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd with a largely unchanged squad bar a couple of key additions in Ané Retief and Anya Williams, Belfast native Cooper believes that they can improve even further this campaign and challenge for the title.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nReflecting on the first season, Cooper said: “It was fantastic. As a club, we were really striving to be in the top four but with hindsight and having had some time to reflect on last season, I think we did really well to build the foundations of the franchise.\n\nView 3 Images A&E doctor Niamh Cooper believes her side won't be underestimated this campaign (Image: Ben Lumley)\n\n“A lot of the clubs underestimated us coming into the league. Some of the players like Rolene (Streutker) were relatively unknown and came on and proved to everybody that she has got a real point to make. A couple of the clubs now really see us as true title contenders, and so they should.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“This year, they will probably work a bit harder to look at how to combat some of the different tactics we brought, especially around the Super Shot.\n\n“This year we have got increased depth on our bench. We brought in Anya and Ané, two brilliant players in attack and defence.\n\n“The goal is to be top four. I think we have everything we need in this team to be a Championship-winning side. If we can align the strengths of every player we have in the 10, we have everything we need to succeed so hopefully you will see us on finals day.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe arrival of Retief and Williams should help solve one of the biggest challenges that Forest faced last season, a lack of depth off the bench.\n\nView 3 Images Nottingham Forest are in their second season in the Netball Super League (Image: Ben Lumley)\n\nWhile the passionate fans at the Motorpoint Arena were able to cheer on a team who could match the league’s best when they were on song, that did not happen quite often enough to emerge as true title contenders.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFor Cooper, the arrival of two new faces could be the answer to those issues as the team tries to live up to the expectations of the sports-mad city.\n\nShe added: “We talk about togetherness and strength in numbers and having that core eight and adding Ané and Anya has really strengthened us. We all know each other really well so it allows us to be direct in training. We can cut out the fluff.\n\n“Anya has brought real energy into training. She is the youngest in the team but you wouldn't know it because she is so loud. She has brought this real energy and vibrancy to energy every week. She's a really accurate shooter, she can play across goal shooter and goal attack. And her movement is very different to the styles we have.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Ané is probably one of the hardest workers in the team. She has that real true South African grit, she takes things on really well and wants to learn continuously. She's come in and been really impressive and I think she will be a force to be reckoned with.\n\n“I think consistency was something that we needed to work on and that comes from being a new team and connections weren't quite there.\n\n“Also the depth on our bench, to be able to turn around and completely change the style up with an Anya or an Ané is a real added string to our bow and will give other teams a lot more to think about this season.”\n\nArticle continues below"

And the consequences were unthinkable. And that's what we kept coming down to.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said Constitution Hill’s performance at Southwell had brought the horse not just to national attention and “to people that don't normally follow it, and then you realise what damage you could do if you went the other way and it went wrong.”\n\n“I'd say I would have packed up,” he added. “It would have been the end of me. If he got hurt, oh yeah without a doubt.”\n\nView 3 Images Constitution Hill won on his Flat racing debut at Southwell (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nConstitution Hurdle won ten in row before problems surfaced last season. At Cheltenham in January he made a mistake at the last hurdle but stayed on his feet to win.\n\nThen in the Champion Hurdle he fell at the fourth, fell again at the second last at Aintree and went at the second during the Fighting Fifth in November.\n\nHenderson is convinced that the introduction of white coloured hurdles, replacing orange ones, on racecourses by the BHA last season, were to blame.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“These hurdles, in my opinion, were the biggest culprit,\" he said. \"They're not popular, are they? The first mistake he made was in the last British prep race, wasn't it?”"

The freshman class has an abundance of talent, and there are transfers who have transformed programs, with multiple from either category emerging as household names.\n\nWho else should be on your radar, though?\n\nWe've identified 25 breakout stars to know -- players who have bounced back from injuries, returnees who have made significant strides with the same program, and prospects who weren't projected to have the immediate impacts they have had in their first seasons of Division I basketball.\n\nLast season, Haugh was a key reserve for the Florida team that cut down the nets in San Antonio. This season, he is a bona fide All-America candidate and first-round NBA draft prospect who could lead the Gators to their second back-to-back national title reign in program history. His scoring average has increased from 9.8 to 16.9 points while maintaining a similar impact on the glass with 6.0 rebounds per game.\n\nLast season, Anderson was a star in the Sweet 16. This season, he has taken advantage of a bigger workload -- jumping from 30.5 to 38.7 minutes per game -- to emerge as an All-America candidate with 19.6 PPG, 7.7 APG and a 43.9% 3-point shooting rate. With teammate JT Toppin out for the season, Anderson will have to be both Batman and Robin for the Red Raiders come March.\n\nNate Oats coached Alabama to top-five finishes in offensive efficiency with former All-America guard Mark Sears running the show the previous two seasons. Now Philon is the catalyst who has helped the Crimson Tide sustain that production. He's averaging 21.3 points as a sophomore, effectively doubling his 10.6 PPG mark as a freshman.\n\nThough MaxPreps named Wagler its Kansas High School Player of the Year for 2024-25, the 6-foot-6 guard didn't receive many scholarship offers -- Illinois was only one of two high-major programs to extend him one. But the Fighting Illini found an unheralded freshman who could lead them to their first Final Four since 2005, win Big Ten Player of the Year and secure an NBA draft lottery spot.\n\nAfter not starting a single game as a freshman, Tanner is in contention for SEC Player of the Year, averaging 18.5 points while leading Vanderbilt to what will be only its second NCAA tournament appearance since 2017. He's the reason Mark Byington is a national Coach of the Year candidate.\n\nMomcilovich was a contributor (11.5 PPG) on the 2024-25 Iowa State team that earned a 3-seed before losing in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Now he's averaging a career-high 17.4 points and is one of the greatest 3-point shooters (50.7%, No. 1 in the nation) in recent college basketball history. The 6-foot-8 forward is the catalyst for a top-20 offense.\n\nAmid the ups and downs of Darryn Peterson's availability, Kansas has relied on the consistency of Bidunga. The Jayhawks are plus-28.7 points per 100 possessions better when he's on the court, per advanced analytics site EvanMiya, and have benefitted from his defensive presence (9.2 RPG).\n\nMen's Tournament Challenge Sign up now to play the #1 Men's bracket game for FREE! $125,000 in prizes.\n\nPlay Men's Tournament Challenge\n\nThe 6-foot-10 big man is arguably UConn's most important player. After making only one start last season, Reed has started every game he has been healthy for this season (24). The Huskies are at their best when he plays -- they're plus-11.5 points per 100 possessions better with him on the court, according to EvanMiya.\n\nThe defending national champion Gators have lost only two games since Dec. 9, featuring the No. 3 defense in America over that stretch. Chinyelu's contribution to that rise? Opposing players have made just 37% of their shots around the rim against him.\n\nMark Few has said Huff could return from a left knee injury in time for the NCAA tournament, which makes the 6-foot-10 star eligible for this list. Since he last played on Jan. 8, Gonzaga's offense has dropped to 62nd in adjusted efficiency -- a sign of the impact that he and his 17.8 PPG have had in a breakout season that has been affected by injury.\n\nMast sat out the 2023-24 season because of a knee injury before returning this season to lead Nebraska's historic 20-0 start. The 6-foot-10 center has demonstrated that few big men in America can match his well-rounded game: He is top-three in points (13.8), rebounds (6.1) and assists (3.1) for the Cornhuskers.\n\nCameron Boozer is the leader of a strong Duke team -- that much is clear -- but Evans is a critical catalyst for the Blue Devils. He has connected on 44.4% of his 3-point attempts during their five-game winning streak, a sign of a significant turn for a player who has gone from 6.8 points to 14.7 season over season.\n\n13. Aden Holloway, G, Alabama\n\nAs the backup for All-America point guard Mark Sears last season, Holloway looked the part of a future leader for an Alabama team that reached the Elite Eight a year ago. He has become much more than that, as evidenced by the 16.4 points and 4.9 assists he has averaged over the Tide's current seven-game winning streak.\n\nA lower leg injury cost Krivas the bulk of last season; he played in only eight games. He has since returned as one of the anchors of an Arizona team that won its first 23 games. Averaging 10.6 points, 8.5 rebounds and 1.9 blocks, Krivas is rated as an excellent offensive and defensive player by Synergy Sports in his comeback season.\n\nIn high school, the 6-foot-2 guard wasn't even ranked as a top-three prospect in the state of New Hampshire. Now, Okorie is fifth in the country in scoring (22.8) in one of the season's most surprising rises for a freshman who wasn't even on the national radar before this season. He has scored 30 or more points five times in 2025-26.\n\nNgongba has become one of Duke's top contributors, seemingly betting better with each passing game. The 6-foot-11 center helped the Blue Devils conquer one of the most dominant frontcourts in America when they beat then-No. 1 Michigan on Saturday. And he has made 60.2% of shots while holding opponents to a 52% mark around the rim.\n\nChandler has been a consistent starter for Kentucky a season after averaging 10.4 minutes. The 6-foot-5 guard has made one of the nation's most impressive leaps as a shooter over the last year, jumping from a 34.7% clip from 3-point range a season ago to 43.1% this season (including 46.1% in SEC play).\n\nThe leap by Miller over the past year -- from 13.2 PPG and 34.1% from 3 to 18.6 and 41.9% -- is the reason SMU could earn an at-large NCAA tournament bid for the first time in nearly a decade. In his team's biggest wins of the season, against North Carolina and Louisville, the 6-foot guard scored 50 total points.\n\nWhen first-year head coach Ryan Odom announced the signing of the 6-foot-9 forward from Belgium, he said the freshman would \"have an immediate impact in our frontcourt.\" Ridder has lived up to that expectation with his production (15.9 PPG, 6.4 RPG). With the first-year standout on the court, Virginia has registered 121.3 points per 100 possessions.\n\nIt's not easy to project the impact young European prospects can have in college, but New Mexico could win the Mountain West in Eric Olen's first season at the helm as a result of his recruitment of Buljan. The Croatian standout is nearly averaging a double-double (11.9 points, 9.8 rebounds).\n\nHill averaged just 6.2 minutes a season ago and is now the leading scorer -- 14.3 on 36.5% shooting from 3 -- for a VCU team that's chasing Saint Louis for the Atlantic 10 title and its third NCAA tournament appearance in four years.\n\nAt 5-foot-11, Johnson is one of the top players in America. He is also one of the most improved, going from 6.6 PPG last season to 17.4 this season -- and that's in addition to 3.5 APG and 2.6 SPG while shooting 40.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Spartans' standout has made significant strides in scoring (12.3 PPG), on the glass (9.3 RPG) and at the free throw line (86%). But the 6-foot-9 forward's transformation as a deep-ball, high-volume threat (40% on 4.1 3-point attempts per game) has given Tom Izzo's squad a significant boost in its pursuit of another deep tournament run.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 sophomore forward, who has made 59% of his shots inside the arc, is a two-way threat for Josh Schertz's squad. McCottry is listed as a \"very good\" defensive player for a Billikens squad that has played top-25 defense this season. Robbie Avila is the face of the program, but McCottry is an essential component in this team's success in 2025-26.\n\nThe 6-foot-2 freshman wasn't bombarded with scholarship offers after winning Pennsylvania Player of the Year. Averaging 18.3 points for a Merrimack school seeking the first Division I NCAA tournament appearance in school history, the five-time MAAC Rookie of the Week has made a lot of the schools who passed on him look foolish."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Quarterback Diego Pavia wasn't fazed by criticism at Vanderbilt, and it doesn't appear that's going to change now that he's on the NFL's doorstep.\n\nThe NFL draft prospect hasn't toned things down during the NFL combine, where he said he'll throw for scouts on Saturday.\n\n\"One thing about me is I don't care what people think about me,\" said Pavia, who led the Commodores to a 10-3 record, the first 10-win season in school history.\n\nCriticism of him, he said, is the product of the media generating what he described as \"clickbait.\"\n\nBut Pavia certainly became a polarizing figure in 2025, in part because of his exuberance and in part because of his reaction to the Heisman Trophy balloting. The Heisman runner-up had to issue an apology after posting a message that included \"F-All THE VOTERS\" on social media.\n\nBut Pavia said his demeanor and approach are what made him a good leader at Vanderbilt. And his confidence, he said, comes from being constantly counted out in life, including when he started his career in junior college.\n\nThat has turned out to be a credit to him in his quest to make it in the NFL, he said.\n\n\"I feel like a lot of teams love the tenacity, the fight,\" he said. \"The life of an underdog, that's for sure. And, so, they ask questions. But you go back, you look at my record, ain't nothing on my record.\"\n\nHe added, \"I just want everyone to know what's true about me is I'm humble and I get my confidence from my process. And if you saw how much I put into this, you would see where I get my confidence.\"\n\nAnother thing NFL teams will need to weigh is Pavia's lack of size. He measures under 5-foot-10, a big detriment at the position in the NFL. But playing at that size against elite competition is nothing new, he said.\n\n\"I would just say turn on the tape,\" Pavia said. \"It's not like we're not playing these guys that are going first-round, second-round [picks] on Saturdays in the SEC. So, the SEC and the Big Ten probably have the most guys getting drafted in the first, second round. So, we're playing those guys and ain't nothing going to change.\""

            "content": "Louis Riddick raves about why he thinks Ty Simpson has earned a spot as a top-15 pick in the 2026 NFL draft. (0:57)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Former Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson said Friday at the NFL combine that he is prepared to show NFL talent evaluators that he is a \"franchise quarterback.''\n\nSimpson is the No. 25 player overall on ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr.'s Big Board and the No. 2 quarterback behind Indiana's Fernando Mendoza (the No. 1 player overall). Simpson was asked at the combine Friday about his readiness to be an NFL starter. He said he has conveyed his confidence in his abilities to team personnel during the sit-down interviews in Indianapolis.\n\n\"First off, I think I'm ready, I'm a franchise quarterback,'' Simpson said. \"Alabama prepares you the most for the NFL ... The Alabama locker room is as close to an NFL locker room as you can get.''\n\nSimpson said he is healthy after battling some nagging injuries down the stretch this past season, including to his lower back and elbow as well as a fractured rib. He plans to throw Saturday during the on-field workout for quarterbacks. Mendoza is not expected to throw Saturday, so Simpson will be Kiper's highest-ranked quarterback to participate in the combine workout.\n\n\"It's why I decided to throw and why I'm excited about it,'' Simpson said of his health.\n\nHe also addressed his significant weight loss toward the end of the season -- he went from about 210 pounds to just over 190 pounds due to what some in the league have said was a case of gastritis -- and outlined his pre-combine regimen to be prepared for the combine and the draft.\n\n\"Lot of eating, lot of three meals, four meals a day,'' Simpson said of his combine prep. \"Lot of shakes, just getting in a routine of getting up in the morning, eating, drinking chocolate milk, eating lunch, eating the right meal, adding a shake to that, dinner, eating, adding a salad, just sticking to that.''\n\nHe was a one-year starter for the Crimson Tide (11-4) and finished with 3,567 yards passing with 28 touchdowns and five interceptions. But Simpson had 21 of his touchdown passes without an interception over his first eight games of the season and struggled some, including with the injuries. over the second half of the season as well as in the postseason with seven touchdowns to go with the five interceptions over the last six games.\n\nSome scouts have pointed to some struggles in the SEC championship game, a 28-7 loss to Georgia when Simpson was 19-of-39 passing as well as a 38-3 loss to Indiana in the College Football Playoff when Simpson was 12-of-16 for 67 yards.\n\nBut Simpson said Friday he has met with most teams who have needs at quarterback, including the Steelers, Arizona Cardinals and New York Jets. And when asked about the second half of last season, he has been direct in his responses with scouts and coaches.\n\nOn his meeting with the Steelers, Simpson said \"I love Coach [Mike] McCarthy, I love the Steelers.'' He added he hasn't paid much attention to player rankings or quarterback rankings as the draft approaches.\n\n\"It matters what happens April 24th and 25th,'' Simpson said. \"Knowing no matter where I'm projected, where I go, they're going to get the best Ty Simpson.''"

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith sounds off on the Cowboys' decision to franchise-tag George Pickens, calling it a \"huge mistake.\" (2:57)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFRISCO, Texas -- The Dallas Cowboys did what they were long expected to Friday, placing the franchise tag on wide receiver George Pickens to secure his rights at least through 2026, the team announced Friday.\n\nThe tag will guarantees Pickens at least $28 million with Dallas in 2026, but working out a long-term deal remains a possibility. The two sides have until July 15 to sign a long-term contract or, by NFL rule, the player will play on the one-year deal or choose to hold out.\n\nThe team used the nonexclusive designation on Pickens, sources told ESPN, which allows him to talk to other teams when free agency begins March 11. Should Pickens sign an offer sheet with another team, the Cowboys will have the right to match the offer or decline to do so and receive two first-round draft picks as compensation.\n\nThe Cowboys met with Pickens' representatives Thursday at the NFL scouting combine. The talks were described as more general than in-depth.\n\nEarlier in the week, executive vice president Stephen Jones said the Cowboys were \"leaning\" toward using the tag on Pickens. Asked Thursday whether Pickens could be a Cowboy for the long term, coach Brian Schottenheimer said, \"I hope so.\"\n\nPickens' first season with the Cowboys could not have gone better.\n\nAcquired along with a 2027 sixth-round pick from the Pittsburgh Steelers for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round selection, Pickens put up career highs in catches (93), yards (1,429) and touchdowns (nine) while playing every game, being named to the Pro Bowl for the first time and earning second-team All-Pro honors.\n\nPickens, 24, had five games with more than 100 yards receiving, including two that came when CeeDee Lamb was out of the lineup because of a high ankle sprain. Pickens set a franchise record with five games of at least 130 yards receiving and a touchdown catch.\n\nHis 13 catches of at least 25 yards and 73 first-down receptions ranked in the top five in the NFL.\n\nHe and Dak Prescott had an instant chemistry in their first season, much like Prescott developed with Lamb and former Pro Bowler Amari Cooper.\n\nKeeping Pickens on a long-term deal could be dicey.\n\nThe Cowboys signed Lamb to an extension in 2024 that pays him $34 million annually and included $100 million in guaranteed money. While the Cowboys could match or even exceed Lamb's numbers, they might be reluctant to do so for long-term cap issues and how they want to build their roster over the next few seasons.\n\nThey already have the highest-paid player, Prescott ($60 million), the highest-paid interior offensive lineman, Tyler Smith ($23.4 million), and the third-highest-paid receiver (Lamb). If they sign Pro Bowl kicker Brandon Aubrey, a restricted free agent, to an extension, he would likely be the highest paid at his position.\n\nAnd the Cowboys have work to do on a defense that allowed the most points in franchise history in 2025 (511).\n\nThe last player the Cowboys signed on a first-time franchise tag to a multiyear deal before the July 15 deadline was Dez Bryant in 2015. The Cowboys signed defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence (2019) and Prescott (2021) to extensions after they placed the tag on them the second time.\n\nThis is the 11th time the Cowboys have used the franchise tag, and Pickens is the eighth different player. Anthony Spencer, Lawrence and Prescott were tagged twice. Since 2020, the Cowboys have used the tag every year but 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe past two times they used the tag came in 2022 and 2023 on tight end Dalton Schultz and running back Tony Pollard, who ultimately left as free agents the following season.\n\nAdding further spice to contract negotiations is the history between the team and one of Pickens' agents, David Mulugheta, who also represents pass rusher Micah Parsons.\n\nLast year, Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said he and Parsons reached an agreement on a deal that would have made Parsons the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL. When Mulugheta balked at the agreement, talks between the sides cooled and never really rekindled.\n\nParsons did not take part in the offseason program and went through a hold-in during training camp, attending meetings while in Oxnard, California, but he did not practice.\n\nA week before the 2025 season began, Parsons was traded to the Green Bay Packers for two first-round picks, and he signed a four-year, $188 million deal that included $120 million guaranteed.\n\nSpeaking on \"First Take\" after the Parsons trade in September, Mulugheta said talks regarding a potential Pickens deal would not be impacted by what happened last summer. Asked late in the season if he would talk directly with Jones on a contract, Pickens said he would let his agent do the deal.\n\nTheoretically, Pickens could follow the similar offseason and training camp path that Parsons chose last summer if the sides are not able to work out a long-term extension."

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

The University recognised her appointment as Chancellor of the Women's University in Africa in Zimbabwe, a role she held from 2018 to 2024. In that capacity, she demonstrated sustained commitment to advancing women’s access to higher education and promoting academic excellence across Africa.\n\nProfessor Opoku-Agyemang’s association with the University of Cape Coast is both longstanding and historic. As an alumna, she later returned to serve as Vice-Chancellor from 2008 to 2012, becoming the first female Vice-Chancellor of a public university in Ghana — another landmark achievement in her career.\n\nThe University described her journey from student to Vice-Chancellor and now Vice President as emblematic of visionary leadership, academic excellence and dedicated public service.\n\nThe Distinguished Fellow Award ceremony is scheduled to take place on Friday, March 13, 2026, at 2:00 p.m. at the New Examination Centre (NEC) of the University of Cape Coast.\n\nThe University congratulated Professor Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on the honour, describing it as a fitting recognition of her exceptional contributions to education, governance and national development.\n\n\"The University of Cape Coast congratulates Her Excellency Prof. Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang on this distinguished award,\" the statement concluded.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Thank you, Right Honourable Speaker\n\nHonourable Members of the August House\n\nYour Excellency, Vice President Jane Naana Opoku-Agyemang\n\nYour Excellency, the First Lady, Mrs Lordina Dramani Mahama\n\nYour Lordship, the Chief Justice\n\nThe good people of Ghana\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is both a profound honour and a constitutional duty to appear before the House to deliver a message on the State of the Nation, as required by Article 67 of our Constitution.\n\nI do so with the perspective earned through decades of public service, including my time in this very Chamber as a Member of Parliament and my previous term as President from 2012 to 2017. My journey in public service, like that of our nation, has not followed a straight path. It has been marked by periods of steady progress, by setbacks, and by determined recovery.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nThat pattern of resilience mirrors the national experience. And today, I stand before you to speak to another such defining moment, a moment of rebound, of national renewal, and of restored hope in our country's history. This moment is being shaped by hard choices, institutional resolve, and a renewed commitment to stability and national purpose.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nIn just a few days, on 6th March 2026, Ghana will celebrate 69 years of independence on the theme \"Building Prosperity, Restoring Hope.\" This theme is not merely ceremonial. It is the blueprint that guides my administration's vision and action. It reflects where we have been, acknowledges the difficulties we have endured, and confidently declares where we are headed. At the heart of this vision are two complementary and mutually reinforcing agendas: the Resetting Ghana Agenda and the Accra Reset.\n\nThe Resetting Ghana Agenda is our national commitment to restore economic stability, rebuild public trust, strengthen institutions, and deliver tangible improvements in the lives of ordinary Ghanaians. It is about turning the page on years of mismanagement, confronting our challenges with honesty, and charting a new course anchored in fiscal discipline, transparency, and sustainable development.\n\nThe Accra Reset, on the other hand, is our continental commitment. It recognises that Ghana's prosperity cannot be separated from Africa's progress. It calls for a fundamental shift in how African nations relate to one another and to the world, from dependence to self-reliance, from fragmentation to integration, and from reactive postures to strategic leadership.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThese two agendas are deeply interlinked. We cannot build lasting prosperity at home without contributing to stability and growth across our continent. Equally, we cannot lead effectively on the continental stage if our own house is not in order.\n\nTogether, these frameworks demonstrate our determination to restore hope, not merely as a promise but as a lived reality for Ghanaians and Africans alike. As we build on the foundation laid in 2025, the first year of my return to the Presidency, we do so with clarity of purpose, unity of action, and confidence in our ability to deliver a future worthy of our people's sacrifices and aspirations.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThis moment of national renewal unfolds against the backdrop of a world in profound flux. The global order we once knew is being rapidly reshaped, and the so-called \"rules-based international system\" endures only as long as it protects the advantages of those who designed it.\n\nOnce emerging nations begin to operate within those same rules to rebalance power, the very architects of that order prove willing to relax their commitments. Ghana, like many nations, has learned this hard truth. We cannot respond to this new reality with fragmentation, hesitation, or continued dependence. History has long taught us that resilience and prosperity will not be handed to us—they must be built deliberately through cooperation, self-belief, and strategic alignment. The era ahead demands that Africa move from a posture of dependence to one of collective self-reliance.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nIt is in this spirit that Ghana has sought to play a convening and catalytic role on the continent. In the middle of last year, our capital, Accra, hosted African Heads of State, policymakers, and development partners for a landmark Health Sovereignty Summit.\n\nTogether, we charted a new roadmap for healthcare financing and collaboration among African nations. The message was clear: Africa must take ownership of its health security, pool its resources, deepen collaboration, and design financing solutions that reflect our realities rather than external prescriptions.\n\nStrong economies require healthy populations, and health sovereignty is inseparable from economic sovereignty. The same logic applies to trade, industry, and growth. Africa's future lies in dismantling artificial borders, removing bottlenecks that stifle commerce, and fully activating a common market that allows our goods, services, capital, and ideas to move freely across the continent.\n\nNo single African country, no matter how well-endowed, can thrive alone in this new global environment. Rather, when we work together, our combined markets, youthful population, natural resources, and creativity will constitute one of the greatest economic opportunities of this century. Africa must summon the courage to shape its own destiny. Building genuine sovereignty across Africa. The Global South requires a deliberate and disciplined plan, one that begins with:\n\nUnlocking the immense human and creative potential of our young people;\n\nStrengthening regional value chains to add value to what we produce;\n\nMobilising domestic capital to finance our own development, and\n\nSpeaking with a single, coordinated, and confident voice in global affairs.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThis is how Africa can move from promise to power, from participation to leadership, and from dependence to dignity. The path forward is clear. Africa must rise with confidence, unity, and purpose. Ghana stands ready not only to rebuild at home but also to work hand in hand with our African brothers and sisters to shape a future defined by shared strength, dignity, and prosperity.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nWe have resolved here in Ghana to operate with our eyes open to protect our sovereignty and to design policies that place our people first. We will continue to engage with the world, but on terms that reflect our interests. We will uphold global norms, but we will not outsource our judgment. And we will build resilience at home so that shifts in external power do not translate into hardship for our citizens.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nWhen I last came before this House, I spoke candidly about the depth of the challenges we had inherited across all facets of our nation. Nowhere was this national malaise more evident than in the economy. We inherited an economy in severe crisis—burdened by unsustainable debt, high inflation, a rapidly depreciating currency, and an escalating cost-of-living crisis that had left our citizens reeling from unimaginable hardship caused by years of general imprudence and reckless management of the economy.\n\nI was clear from the outset that recovery would not come easily. I was also clear that I would stop at nothing to turn the situation around and bring relief to Ghanaians. I promised that, just as I have confronted and overcome crises in the past, I would reset our economy and return us to a path of growth, progress, and development.\n\nI told this August House when I appeared before you last year that we would have to take tough, prudent, and necessary decisions to restore stability and credibility. Today, I can say with confidence: Ghana is back. Ghana is working again and is open for business. The fundamentals are improving, and the path to sustained acceleration is clear.\n\nFrom the outset, we resolved to choose discipline over waste, reform over excuses, and stability over speculation. As a responsible government, our first order of business was to halt the economic haemorrhage and restore order to our public finances. We tightened expenditure and commitment controls, improved payables reporting, and conducted a comprehensive audit of 2024 commitments to restore credibility and discipline.\n\nThese measures have begun to deliver some of the most remarkable economic outcomes in decades.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nAs we approach the celebration of our 69th Independence Anniversary, we do so not only with pride in our past but also with renewed hope for our future. We are Building Prosperity through sound policy, responsible governance, and inclusive growth. We are Restoring Hope by delivering on our promises and proving that good leadership makes a measurable difference in people's lives.\n\nThe Resetting Ghana Agenda is working. The Accra Reset is gaining momentum. And together, they are laying the foundation for a stronger, more resilient, and more prosperous Ghana.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nOur nation is on the runway. It is in take-off mode, and you are all advised to fasten your seatbelts. The journey continues. But the direction is set. And the hope is real. Our theme today, Building Prosperity, Restoring Hope, is not merely aspirational. It reflects the tangible transformation we have delivered for the Ghanaian people.\n\nOur economy has grown significantly. In 2025, Ghana’s GDP is expected to reach $113 billion, up from $83 billion at the end of 2024. This has placed Ghana among the top 10 largest economies in Africa. Average GDP growth for the first 3 quarters of 2025 is reported at 6.1%. But growth means nothing without discipline. Our primary surplus reached 2.6% of GDP, far exceeding our 1.5% target. Our fiscal deficit closed at 3.1%, well below the projected 3.8%.\n\nThis is not just prudent governance; it is promise-keeping. It has benefited households and businesses because we have borrowed less and spent more responsibly, interest rates have fallen, confidence has returned, and private businesses are breathing again.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThe 19th of December 2022 will go down as one of the darkest days in Ghana’s economic history. Ghana declared its inability to honour its debt obligations. We declared a debt default and placed a moratorium on both domestic and foreign debt repayments. Following this, we entered a protracted and complex debt restructuring process. Ghana’s debt became a shackle on our economic progress, dragging our nation into hardship and despair\n\nLooking at Ghana’s restructured debt profile, it is clear the negotiators on our side were intent on kicking the can down the road, with the largest repayments scheduled between 2025 and 2028. We confronted this crisis with action, not rhetoric. We established sinking funds, restructured obligations, and pursued bilateral agreements.\n\nThe result? Public debt fell by GH¢82.1 billion, from 61.8% to 45.3% of GDP. This is one of the sharpest reductions in our history. We settled a US$709 million Eurobond ahead of schedule, completing US$1.4 billion in debt service for 2025. And the world noticed. Fitch, Moody's, and S&P all upgraded Ghana's credit ratings—the first triple upgrade in years.\n\nGhana’s credibility is restored. Ghana is rising. The heaviest burden we inherited was the very high inflation, which was silently eroding every household’s purchasing power. It peaked at 54.1% at the end of 2022 and declined to 23.5% by the end of 2024. We treated it as the emergency it was. Through fiscal consolidation, currency stabilisation, and disciplined monetary policy, inflation fell from 23.5% to 3.8% over 13 consecutive months by January 2026.\n\nFood inflation fell by 26.6 percentage points. Inflation for locally produced goods fell by 22.6 points. These are not statistics, Mr Speaker. They translate into the reality of parents being able to put meals on the table for their children, and into the reality of businesses thriving and creating opportunities for Ghana’s youth. Petrol prices dropped from GHS15.20 to GHS10.70 per litre.\n\nIt recently dipped below the GHS10 mark for the first time in many years. Diesel fell from GHS15.40 to GHS11.30. This brought relief to our nation's 3.7 million car owners and tens of millions who depend on transportation daily.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nExchange rate volatility has long been at the heart of the hardship Ghanaian households face. We made currency stability a priority, and we have delivered. We did not arrest the dollar; we strengthened the cedi to put up a good fight against the other currencies.\n\nI am pleased to report to this House that the cedi appreciated by 40.7% against the US dollar, 30.9% against the pound, and 24% against the euro.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nGhana’s economic turnaround is broad-based and comprehensive. All sectors of the Ghanaian economy have witnessed remarkable improvement in the first year of my return to the Presidency. Most importantly, Ghana’s economy has surpassed the $100 billion mark and is projected to place Ghana among the top 10 economies in Africa.\n\nOur reserves currently stand at $13.8 billion, covering 5.7 months of imports. A key driver of this development has been the establishment of the Ghana Gold Board. By formalising gold exports, we reduced smuggling, increased recorded exports in the artisanal and small-scale mining sector from 63.6 to 103 tonnes, and channelled foreign exchange into our economy. When the cedi stabilises, imported inflation falls. Businesses can plan more effectively, and household incomes improve.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nAs global uncertainty grows, it is necessary to reduce our country’s exposure to external shocks, break the cycle of economic downturns, and safeguard macroeconomic stability. Just last Wednesday, 25th February 2026, the Minister for Finance presented the Ghana Accelerated National Reserve Accumulation Policy to this House. The policy seeks to strengthen our country’s external resilience by increasing our international reserves to 15 months of import cover by the end of 2028, supporting long-term structural transformation while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nWe have an opportunity to build an economic war chest to withstand global economic shocks, secure macroeconomic stability, improve the standard of living for Ghanaians, and build lasting prosperity for future generations. This is what the policy seeks to achieve. We abolished the nuisance taxes levied on us between 2017 and 2024. These include the E-Levy, Betting Tax, and Emission Tax.\n\nWe have reformed VAT comprehensively by:\n\n1. Abolishing the 1% COVID-19 Levy\n\n2. Decoupling GETFund and NHIL from VAT\n\n3. Reducing VAT from 21.9% to 20%\n\n4. Raising the VAT threshold to GH¢750,000\n\n5. Extending zero-rating on textiles to 2028\n\nThese fiscal reforms have effectively put GH¢6 billion back into the pockets of the Ghanaian. Interest rates have fallen from above 30% to about 18%, freeing up credit for businesses and households. According to the Ghana Statistical Service, over one million Ghanaians found employment between Quarter 1 and Quarter 3 of 2025, and 950,000 people escaped multidimensional poverty in the same period.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nI am pleased to report that our external position has strengthened significantly. By December 2025, our current account recorded a surplus of $9.1 billion, representing 8.1% of GDP. This is a remarkable increase from $1.5 billion, or 1.8% of GDP, a year earlier. This achievement has been driven by robust gold and cocoa exports and increased remittance inflows. This improvement demonstrates that our economy is gaining strength and resilience on the global stage.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nWe have moved decisively from planning to action on our flagship 24-Hour Economy and Accelerated Export Development Programme.\n\nOfficially launched in 2025, this transformative initiative is designed to:\n\n1. Unlock round-the-clock economic activity\n\n2. Deepen value chains across key sectors\n\n3. Boost productivity and support export growth, and\n\n4. Create quality jobs in agriculture, manufacturing, logistics, and services.\n\nOn 6th February 2026, this august House passed the 24-Hour Economy Authority Bill, establishing the regulatory framework and legal mandate necessary for full implementation. Last week, at cabinet, I had the honour of signing this historic legislation into law. All is now set for take-off. This is the boldest economic transformation initiative in recent years.\n\nGHS 110 million has been allocated in the 2026 Budget to begin implementation. These resources will enable businesses to operate beyond traditional business hours, attract private investment through strategic partnerships with the Development Bank of Ghana and the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund, and strengthen the foundations for sustained growth and job creation, especially for our youth.\n\nThis is about building prosperity and restoring hope through concrete action.\n\nMr Speaker, a nation that does not learn from past mistakes cannot get out of the cycle of problems that impose hardship on its citizens. We have just begun to emerge from the most devastating economic crisis in our nation's recent history. This crisis was triggered by general financial indiscipline, huge deficits and massive debt occasioned by persistent unbudgeted expenditure to meet the ends of convenient politicking.\n\nIn the last few weeks, we have had to take the painful but necessary decision to revise the producer price of Cocoa to achieve competitive pricing and resolve acute liquidity challenges in the sector.\n\nFailure to do so would have meant pumping in billions of borrowed funds. This unplanned expenditure would have taken us right back to the very devastating economic problems we have only recently begun to escape.\n\nSo, while fully understanding the concerns and protests of our farmers, I can firmly assure them that the reforms announced by the government will bring about a total transformation of the sector and guarantee them a fair price that enables them to cover the cost of producing the commodity and make decent margins.\n\nThe difference between facing economic hardships and avoiding them is the exercise of sound economic judgement, and I am determined to make decisions that ensure our collective well-being and avoid suffering for all our citizens.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nWe are bringing legislation to this House to tighten our procurement processes by banning sole-sourced contracts, except in exceptional circumstances. We will also bring legislation to this House to make it mandatory to seek Parliament's prior approval before any government asset or property is leased or sold.\n\nLast Tuesday, I caused the Minister for Finance to lay the Value for Money Office Bill before this august house. This is a landmark measure, a fulfilment of yet another campaign promise to the good people of Ghana, designed to decisively end waste, inflated contracts, abandoned projects, and chronic cost overruns that have, for far too long, drained the public purse.\n\nAll these measures are intended to improve public trust and accountability.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nIn January 2025, we inherited an energy sector on the brink of collapse and precipitated by a severe financial crisis. The sector was burdened with a staggering GHS 80 billion in legacy debts, threatening the operational viability of key power producers. The $500 million World Bank Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG), a critical risk-mitigation instrument established in 2015 during my first term to safeguard nearly $8 billion of private-sector investment in the Offshore Cape Three Points (OCTP) field, had been fully exhausted due to prolonged non-payment for gas supplied.\n\nAt the distribution level, the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) was plagued by high commercial and technical losses, collecting only 62% of the energy it purchased and declaring less than 50% of its collections into the Cash Waterfall Mechanism (CWM). This resulted in severe liquidity shortfalls and power supply challenges throughout 2024. In the petroleum sector, years of policy inconsistency, regulatory inefficiencies, a lack of transparency, prolonged licensing processes, and unresolved legal disputes over field unitisation had eroded investor confidence.\n\nConsequently, crude oil production declined by approximately 32% between 2019 and 2024, falling from 71.4 million barrels to 48.2 million barrels.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nI am pleased to announce that, as of December 31, 2025, the Government has fully repaid and restored the entire $500 million World Bank PRG, including interest. This has reinstated the facility in full and reaffirmed Ghana's standing as a credible and reliable partner on the global stage.\n\nIn addition, between January and December 2025, through carefully coordinated policy actions, the Government settled all outstanding gas invoices owed to ENI and Vitol, amounting to approximately $500 million. Ghana is now fully up to date with its gas consumption obligations to the Sankofa partners. The 2026 Budget has made adequate provision to ensure timely payments for all LNG going forward.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTo ensure equity and fairness, the Government has also held constructive engagements with Tullow Oil and the Jubilee Field partners and reached a comprehensive roadmap to guarantee full payment for all gas consumed. This approach supports reliable nationwide electricity generation and accelerates industrial growth. Engagement with upstream partners has resulted in increased gas production, guided by a clear national vision to rapidly scale up domestic gas supply and reduce reliance on expensive liquid fuels.\n\nBeyond clearing inherited arrears, a robust framework has been established to strengthen monitoring and implementation of the Cash Waterfall Mechanism. Another major milestone was the operationalisation of the ECG Single Holding Account, overseen jointly by the Ministry and the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC). This intervention has significantly reduced revenue leakage and enhanced ECG's capacity to meet its payment obligations.\n\nTo address the high cost of power, the government has successfully renegotiated existing Power Purchase Agreements. Engagements with nine (9) Independent Power Producers (IPPs) have resulted in $250 million in immediate savings and $1.1 billion of debt restructured for payment in the period 2026–2028. The revised agreements will be submitted to Cabinet and Parliament for approval and ratification.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nUnder the Rural Electrification Programme, 200 out of 400 communities have been connected to the national grid, with a further 100 at various stages of completion. The national electricity access rate now stands at 89.05%. We are committed to ensuring that every Ghanaian has access to reliable, affordable electricity. It is worrying that the Electricity Company of Ghana continues to experience high power losses, with reports indicating that around 25% of generated power is lost.\n\nTo address this phenomenon and anchor the gains we have made, adopting private-sector involvement, particularly in billing and collections, is the most effective way to significantly reduce these losses. Cabinet has approved the Multiple Lease Method for concessions in the distribution utilities, and work is ongoing to implement this critical reform.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nThe Bui Power Authority has completed an additional 50MW of solar plant. In the distributed solar sector, 30MW was achieved through rooftop installations, bringing the total installed capacity to 285MW and representing 5% of renewable energy in our generation mix. A few months ago, I broke ground for a 200 MWp solar power project at the Dawa Industrial Zone, with the first 100 MWp scheduled for completion in December 2026.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nThe Ministry of Energy and Green Transition is constructing 35 mini-grids to serve 47 islands and lakeside communities in the Oti, Savannah, and Bono East regions. The ministry will also supply 12,000 new smart net meters from the end of the first quarter of this year, 2026.\n\nUnder the off-grid solar home systems for public institutions, delivery of materials for the first phase of 350 systems has commenced.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nAs part of the last-mile electrification effort to achieve 99.98% universal access by 2030, the ministry has mainstreamed mini-grids into the National Electrification Scheme (NES). Consequently, a feasibility study for the Afram Plains North District was completed for 100 communities, bringing the total number of islands and lakeside communities in the Afram Plains North and South to 150, ready for mini-grid electrification.\n\nThe African Development Bank has committed to providing $100 million to fund the construction of renewable energy-based mini grids for these communities.\n\nMr. Speaker,\n\nI am pleased to announce that we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Jubilee and TEN Field partners to commit $2 billion to additional investment in the Jubilee field. This will include drilling up to 20 new wells. There’s a second Memorandum of Intent with the OCTP Partners to commit $1.5 billion to additional investment in the OCTP field, the Cape Three Points Block 4 Contract Area, among others. This agreement will significantly increase Ghana's oil and gas production, thereby enhancing energy security, domestic demand, and infrastructure development.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nI am happy to announce that the government is on course to revitalise the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company through a strategic partnership with the National Petroleum Authority, Ghana Gas, and the Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB). This will boost production, ensure a steady supply of safe LPG cylinders, and strengthen local manufacturing.\n\nAs you all know, the Tema Oil Refinery is back. The new management of the refinery has successfully completed extensive Turnaround Maintenance, and I am pleased to inform this August House that, for the first time since 2018, the refinery has commenced processing of crude oil.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nLet me assure our countrymen and women that the energy sector reform continues unabated. I remain fully committed to turning around the sector, strengthening its foundations, and ensuring reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy security for our nation.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nAgriculture remains central to our national renewal. Since January 2025, this administration has embarked on a decisive reset of Ghana’s agricultural sector under the Agriculture for Economic Transformation Agenda, with the Feed Ghana Programme serving as the flagship vehicle for implementation.\n\nOur objective is clear: to restore food sovereignty, stabilise food prices, reduce import dependence, create decent jobs, especially for the youth, and reposition agriculture as a strategic growth sector under our 24-Hour economy policy. In January 2025, food inflation stood at 28.3 per cent, following an unprecedented peak of 61 per cent in January 2023. This situation placed severe pressure on households and undermined national stability. Today, food inflation has declined significantly to 4.9%, providing relief to Ghanaian families and businesses.\n\nIn addition, we have committed GHS 300 million to the National Food Buffer Stock Company to mop up excess produce, stabilise prices, and build a strategic national food buffer against emergencies, marking the first time Ghana has deliberately built a food reserve for national resilience. Over 413 institutions, from basic schools through to tertiary institutions, have been registered and are actively participating in the Feed Ghana Programme. Institutional farming is currently being undertaken by the Ghana Armed Forces, the Ghana Prisons Service, the National Service Authority, basic and second-cycle schools, public universities, and faith-based organisations, including churches and mosques.\n\nA key pillar of the Feed Ghana Programme is the Home Gardening Initiative. Across the country, families are encouraged to grow vegetables at home and in their communities to reduce food expenditure, improve household nutrition, and enhance food availability. The Feed Ghana Programme is firmly anchored on Irrigation for Wealth Creation. The government is deliberately shifting agriculture from rain-fed dependence to irrigation-based farming to support year-round production and strengthen climate resilience.\n\nOver the past months, processes have begun for the following interventions: the construction of 10 new small dams, the rehabilitation of 8 existing irrigation dams, and the construction of 250 solar-powered boreholes for farming communities and schools across the northern belt, Bono, and Ahafo regions. In addition, major irrigation schemes, including Vea, Weta, Tanoso, Kpong, Ashaiman, and Aveyime, are undergoing rehabilitation, while new inland valleys covering over 1,300 hectares are being developed to expand rice production.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nUnder the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme (GAFSP), we have launched a $20 million Agro-Input Distribution Project to strengthen food and nutrition security across the Northern Savannah Ecological Zone. The project is being implemented in 12 districts across six regions with a target of 50,000 farming households, including 30,000 women and youth. It will support the production of key staples: maize, rice, soybeans, cowpeas, and groundnuts, while promoting year-round vegetable cultivation through solar-powered micro-irrigation schemes for farmer groups and selected schools.\n\nThe project is also supporting backyard and commercial poultry production, as well as the distribution of fertiliser and certified seeds to participating districts. This will help strengthen the poultry value chain. We are working to fulfil the promise of establishing Farmer Services Centres across the country to modernise agriculture. Procurement processes are underway for a total of 660 tractors, 400 combine harvesters and more than 4,000 agricultural machines and implements.\n\nThe first 11 centres to be constructed this year will provide affordable access to land preparation, harvesting, storage, input supply, extension services, and equipment leasing, especially for smallholder farmers.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nAgricultural extension remains the backbone of productivity, and to address the current gap between farmers and extension officers, 540 motorbikes are being procured to improve extension coverage. 150 of the bikes have already been distributed. We are employing 400 Feed Ghana District Coordinators nationwide, while 10,000 young Ghanaians are being enrolled under a four-year National Service Agripreneur Programme, with annual absorption into permanent service. So far, 3,000 youth have been posted by the National Service Authority under the Agripreneur Programme.\n\n\n\nThis intervention is strengthening frontline service delivery and creating employment opportunities for young people. We are also placing farmer cooperatives at the centre of our agricultural transformation plan. As of October 2025, 70,000 Community Commodity-Focused Farmer Cooperatives had been established nationwide. They are serving as platforms for access to inputs, mechanisation, extension services, climate advisories, aggregation, and fair market negotiation.\n\n\n\nThe Government is actively linking farmers to agro-industrial investments to stabilise prices, create jobs, and accelerate Ghana’s journey towards food security. A major highlight of this effort is a €154 million Italy–Ghana irrigated commercial farming project to establish a 10,000-hectare irrigated model farm to produce rice, maize, soya, and tomatoes.\n\nAll produce from this project will be sold locally. This intervention is strategically designed to fast-track progress towards food security, ensure a reliable supply of raw materials for agro-processing, and reduce Ghana’s dependence on food imports.\n\nOther key initiatives under the value-addition and agro-industrialisation drive include rice processing facilities in the Upper East Region, poultry feed production facilities in the Ashanti Region, and cashew and onion processing facilities in the Bono East Region. In addition, a 40-tonne-per-day soya processing plant is being established in Northern Ghana to support soybean farmers and reduce feed costs. The shea industry is also being revived through secured export contracts and measures to protect local raw material supplies.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTo reduce Ghana’s $300 to $400 million annual poultry import bill, the government has launched a comprehensive Poultry Farm-to-Table Project. These comprise 50 Anchor or Commercial Farmers producing 4 million birds, 500 SMEs producing 3 million birds, and a small-scale (Nkoko Nketenkete) backyard poultry Programme, targeting 3 million birds nationwide, with emphasis on women and youth.\n\nThe Nkoko Nketenkete Programme is underway. The target is to reach 60,000 households. Even before the launch, 720,000 birds were distributed during the pilot phase to 13,000 farmers in 12 districts. A poultry processing factory is under construction in Bechem to support expected production growth.\n\nMr Speaker, education remains pivotal to our national transformation agenda. In this regard, the year 2025 was both eventful and momentous for Ghana’s education sector. I am pleased to report that all flagship initiatives and commitments contained in our Reset Manifesto were faithfully honoured during the year under review. The No-Fees-Stress Initiative was successfully launched in Koforidua and has benefited over 152,698 duly validated first-year students in public tertiary institutions. The number of beneficiaries is projected to exceed 220,000 first-year students in the 2026 academic year.\n\nIn collaboration with the Student Loan Trust Fund, law students in Ghana can now access the student loan scheme to pursue legal education. The Free Tertiary Education Policy for Persons with Disabilities has also been launched and is now fully benefiting all eligible persons with disabilities enrolled in our tertiary institutions nationwide.\n\nThe 2025 academic year saw a stable, uninterrupted supply of quality food to all schools under the Free Senior High School Programme.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTo further deepen coordination, accountability, and effectiveness in the education sector, this honourable house passed several important pieces of legislation in 2025. These include:\n\n1. The Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Bill, 2025,\n\n2. The Ghana Scholarship Authority Bill, 2025,\n\n3. The Change of Universities’ Names Bills, 2025,\n\n4. The University for Development Studies Bill, 2025, and\n\n5. The Ghana Education Trust Fund Bill, 2025.\n\nTo enhance private-sector participation in the tertiary education sector, new legislation will be introduced to ease regulatory bottlenecks and remove the requirement to charter, making it optional.\n\n\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nBasic education remains the critical entry point into our education system. It is at this level that children acquire foundational literacy, numeracy, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills upon which all future learning depends. The government is, therefore, undertaking a major policy shift to rebalance our education investments in favour of basic education. As part of this shift, the Standards-Based Curriculum from Kindergarten to Primary Six is currently under review to incorporate robotics, coding, and the responsible integration of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nAdditionally, as part of the ongoing curriculum review, artificial intelligence education will be introduced in an age-appropriate and developmentally sensitive manner, with a strong emphasis on ethical use, digital responsibility, critical thinking, and human values.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nIn response to the persisting challenge of schools under trees, the Government has programmed a bold and decisive intervention for the 2026 financial year. This includes the construction of 200 kindergarten blocks, 200 primary school blocks, and 200 junior high school blocks nationwide.\n\nI am further pleased to inform this Honourable House that the Government has fully cleared all outstanding Capitation Grant arrears owed to public basic schools, as well as all outstanding BECE registration subsidies due to the West African Examinations Council for previous academic years.\n\nMr Speaker, education for learners with special needs is not only a moral right but also a sound, pragmatic investment that promotes equity and strengthens social cohesion. In recognition of this, the amended GETFund Act has established a dedicated, sustainable funding framework to implement Free Education for learners with special needs, beginning in the 2026 academic year.\n\nThe government has also increased the daily feeding grant for students in public Special Schools from GHS 8.00 to GHS 15.00 for the 2025/2026 academic year. This significant increment reflects our resolve to address the unique nutritional and health needs of learners with disabilities. In addition, Mr Speaker, we will construct a modern, state-of-the-art Special Needs School in Ho in the Volta Region, and rehabilitate and upgrade the existing Special Needs School in Akropong, Akuapem.\n\nIn fulfilment of our pledge to provide free sanitary pads to schoolgirls as part of efforts to improve menstrual hygiene and reduce absenteeism among female learners, a total of 12.2 million packs of sanitary pads were distributed to girls in public schools across the country in 2025.\n\nWe allocated GHS 292.4 million in the 2026 Budget to sustain this initiative. This commitment aims to remove gender-specific barriers to education and ensure that no girl’s education is interrupted due to challenges related to menstrual hygiene.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of efforts to decongest Senior High Schools, increase access and ensure parity in educational opportunities, the government will convert and upgrade 30 Category C schools to Category B, and 10 Category B schools to Category A. In addition, facilities in existing Category A schools will be upgraded and expanded.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) remain a critical pillar of our strategy to address youth unemployment and accelerate skills development. The government will construct six Regional TVET Centres of Excellence across the country to equip young people with practical, industry-relevant skills aligned with the demands of the evolving labour market.\n\nThere is also an ongoing review of the national curriculum to align with the OECD Future of Education and Skills framework. This will make TVET education more adaptive and resilient.\n\nMr Speaker, to expand access to higher education, support balanced regional growth, and meet the rising demand for quality tertiary education, we have entered international partnerships to establish two public universities—one in Kintampo, Bono East Region, and another in Jasikan, Oti Region. A grant has also been secured from China to establish a new public university in Damongo, enhancing access to tertiary education in underserved areas.\n\nMr Speaker,\n\nTechnical Universities play a critical role in closing skills gaps and reducing youth unemployment by delivering high-quality, industry-aligned, and practice-oriented training within a broader policy framework that stimulates labour demand. In this regard, the Government will establish three (3) new Technical Universities to strengthen skills development, enhance innovation, and support national industrialisation efforts.\n\nThe teacher’s housing initiative is a joint effort involving the District Assemblies’ common fund, GETfund, GNAT, and GESOPS to build 50,000 housing units for teachers. This partnership demonstrates our collective dedication to enhancing teachers’ living conditions, boosting retention—especially in rural and remote areas—and ensuring educators can live, work, and retire with dignity and security.\n\nMr Speaker, by prioritising equitable access and expanding infrastructure, we are investing in human capital and laying the foundation for a Ghana where every child can learn, grow, and succeed. Mr Speaker, by January 2025, Ghana’s health system was under severe strain. Ageing and deteriorating equipment, stalled hospital projects, amounting to GHS 15 billion in liabilities, and growing workforce pressures had weakened service delivery.\n\nOver the past year, donor support declined sharply from 19% of total health spending three years ago to just 2.2% today, creating an annual financing gap of more than GHS 2.4 billion.\n\nThe withdrawal of support from programmes previously financed by partners such as USAID exposed vulnerabilities in essential supplies and services, particularly in remote and underserved communities. Faced with these realities, my government chose to act decisively.\n\nIn 2026, direct government funding will account for about 72% of total health spending, up from 56.8% in 2023. Core health allocations have risen to GHS 23.3 billion, and with National Health Insurance resources included, total health financing now stands at GHS 34.7 billion. This reflects our clear commitment to domestic financing and health sovereignty. At the same time, we have faced the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Today, NCDs account for over 40% of all deaths in Ghana and remain a major cause of household poverty.\n\nTo address this, the government established the Ghana Medical Trust Fund (MahamaCares), the first nationwide financing mechanism dedicated to chronic and non-communicable diseases. Mr Speaker, the National Health Insurance Levy has been uncapped.\n\nClaims payments are now timed, with facilities no longer waiting more than half a year for payment.\n\nWe have also finalised measures to increase provider tariffs by over 100% to reflect realistic costs. As a result of the increased trust, NHIS enrolment has risen from 57% at the start of 2025 to 66% today. Over the past two decades, Ghana’s health workforce density has risen from 16.6 per 10,000 people in 2005 to nearly 42 per 10,000 today, while public-sector health employment has doubled to approximately 200,000 workers. Yet significant challenges remain.\n\nAt the beginning of 2025, 103,000 trained health workers were still awaiting placement, employment, or enrolment on the payroll. Over the past year, 13,500 nurses and midwives, along with hundreds of doctors and pharmacists, were absorbed into the public payroll. Nursing trainee allowances have been regularised, application fees reduced, and the no-fee stress initiative introduced to ease access to training. Service conditions are being implemented to boost morale and retention.\n\nLooking ahead, the government will expand recruitment and take necessary actions to add more health workers to the payroll. We will correct the maldistribution of health workers through targeted incentives for underserved areas. Let me use this opportunity to appeal to our gallant health workers to accept postings to our underserved areas, seeing it as a call to national duty, while we work to ensure they have an enabling environment.\n\nMr Speaker, we will also scale up specialist and advanced nursing training to match the country’s changing disease burden. New post-basic nursing programmes in Cardiology, Nephrology, Endocrinology, and Oncology Nursing will be introduced this year, while two existing ones – Emergency and Critical Care – will be scaled up. At least 30 nursing training institutions will transition to a competency-based degree curriculum, supported by new scholarship opportunities for PhD-level training for nurses and allied health professionals.\n\nMr Speaker, on health infrastructure, my government remains firm in its commitment not to abandon unfinished projects. We will continue to retool facilities, strengthen emergency and disease surveillance systems, and ensure that health infrastructure is properly aligned with staffing, equipment, and financing. In the 2026 Budget, provision has been made to commence Regional Hospitals in the Oti, Savannah, and Western North Regions, expanding access to quality care.\n\nAligned with the RESET Agenda, we are making strategic investments in local pharmaceutical and vaccine production. The government has allocated USD 50 million in seed funding to the National Vaccine Institute. In 2025, a local manufacturer secured market authorisation for a snake venom antiserum produced in Ghana. We are also finalising steps to implement an Advanced Market Commitment to prioritise locally manufactured vaccines, sera, and pharmaceuticals in public procurement.\n\nProduction of the Tetanus-Diphtheria vaccine is expected to commence this year through a partnership with an Indonesian pharmaceutical firm. Disease control remains a priority in our country. Immunisation financing has been strengthened. In 2025, the vaccine budget for children and pregnant women increased by 46%, exceeding GHS 171 million, enabling Ghana to fully and promptly finance its vaccines and reduce the risk of preventable outbreaks.\n\nIn 2025, we also introduced the HPV vaccine to protect girls and women against cervical cancer. Ghana’s HIV prevalence is estimated at 1.6%. There are about 350,000 people living with HIV/AIDS. Although prevalence is low, some population segments and regions have significantly higher incidence than the national average. The Ghana AIDS Commission has been tasked with ensuring the availability of testing and antiretroviral treatment.\n\nThis year, my government will fully roll out a Free Primary Health Care programme, removing cost barriers at the primary level where most health needs are met, while strengthening prevention, screening, and health promotion, especially for non-communicable diseases.\n\nThe Ghana Medical Trust Fund will be scaled up, and access to advanced cardiac care, including cardiac catheterisation services at Tamale Teaching Hospital, Korlebu Teaching Hospital and Komfo Anokye Hospital, will be expanded to reduce overseas referrals and position Ghana as a centre for specialised care in the sub-region, in line with our Medical Tourism agenda.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is expected to issue guidelines to eliminate the unacceptable “no-bed” syndrome observed in some of our health facilities. Patients facing medical emergencies must be received and given help, even under makeshift conditions. Government will expand capacity by implementing the Ridge Hospital phase II, completing the Police Hospital project and the La General Hospital. In the Ashanti region, the completion of the Sewua Hospital, the Aferi Military Hospital and the KATH Maternal and Children’s Block is on course.\n\nMr Speaker, we remain on course to build a stronger, more resilient, and more self-reliant health system for all Ghanaians.\n\nIn the road sector, we inherited a burden of significant financial obligations and structural pressures accumulated over the years. As of December 2024, outstanding payments on road projects financed through the Consolidated Fund stood at GHS 21 billion. These were certified works executed by contractors across the country for which payment had not been made.\n\nIn addition, indebtedness to contractors lodged with the Ghana Road Fund Secretariat and awaiting payment totaled GHS 5.43 billion. This figure excludes accruing interest charges, which continue to compound the State’s financial exposure. Beyond these arrears, we inherited contractual commitments totalling more than GHS 104 billion. These commitments represent signed contracts for road projects at various stages of execution - many without corresponding secured funding to guarantee timely completion.\n\nMr Speaker, by the end of 2025, the ministries of finance and roads had cleared arrears amounting to GHS 10 billion owed to road contractors, and they are steadily continuing to reduce sector debts. The Big Push Infrastructure Programme is my vision for a national infrastructure drive to restore critical roads, open economic corridors, create jobs, and reduce the cost of doing business.\n\nWork has started on 50 road projects spanning 1,144 km under the Big Push initiative. The total estimated cost for these projects is GHS 50 billion. Meanwhile, government is also completing 23 projects awarded by the previous administration that were underfunded. These projects cover 573 km and are estimated to cost GHS 15 billion.\n\nAcross all 16 regions, 73 projects are advancing, with significant, visible progress expected by year-end. Some of the critical projects currently ongoing include:\n\n1. Tepa-Mabang-Goaso\n\n2. Kumasi by-pass road\n\n3. Suame Interchange and local roads\n\n4. Sunyani Outer Ring Road\n\n5. Sampa-Jinijini Road\n\n6. Techiman-Nkonsia-Wenchi\n\n7. Dualization of Winneba-Cape Coast Road\n\n8. Kwahu Tafo-Adawso Road\n\n9. Dodowa-Afienya-Dawhenya Road\n\n10. Gbintiri-Nakpanduri Road\n\n11. Tamale Outer Ring Road\n\n12. Wenchi-Sawla Road\n\n13. Sawla-Wa Road\n\n14. Bole-Chache and Bole Town Roads\n\n15. Navrongo-Tumu Road\n\n16. Tumu-Han-Lawra Road\n\n17. Atimpoku-Ho Road\n\n18. Ho -Denu Road\n\n19. Dualization of Accra-Aflao Road Phase I\n\n20. Dualization of Cape Coast-Takoradi Road\n\n21. Dadieso Akontombra Road\n\nAlso, feeder roads like:\n\n1. Akosombo-Gyakiti-Kudikope\n\n2. Yeniam Junction-Sedorm\n\n3. Apeguso-Mpakadan\n\n4. Todome-Toh Kpalime-Dzemeni\n\nIndeed, there are many other roads, too numerous to mention. As I said at the launch of the Big Push Programme, the whole of Ghana will be a construction site, and Ghanaians can testify that serious roadworks are underway across the country.\n\nMr Speaker, the Accra-Kumasi Expressway is a 198.7 km, six-lane, high-speed motorway designed to connect Ghana's two largest cities and is expected to reduce travel time to approximately 2.5 hours. This new alignment, with eight interchanges, will be Ghana's first true expressway.\n\nThe government has established the Accra-Kumasi Expressway Limited, a subsidiary of the Ghana Infrastructure Investment Fund, as the Concessionaire, mandated to design, finance, construct, operate, and maintain the Expressway and associated facilities, with the Ministry of Roads and Highways as the Contracting Authority. Project delivery is structured as a long-term concession of up to 50 years.\n\nThe Accra–Kumasi Expressway Project will be Ghana’s first purpose-built expressway, with limited access points, higher speed limits, and modern safety infrastructure to reduce travel time and improve road safety. Preparatory activities, including feasibility studies, detailed designs, and cost assessments, are underway.\n\nThis major road construction work aims to improve mobility, safety, and trade while connecting communities to markets and essential services. Now to the Eastern Corridor Road. We aim to complete all unfinished segments of that road by the end of 2027.\n\nWe will continue and complete the 27.7km Accra-Tema Motorway and Extension Project. This includes reconstructing the Accra-Tema Motorway into a four-lane expressway with a three-lane service road in both directions, and interchanges at the Ashaiman under-bridge, Community 18, and Teshie Link. It also involves remodelling the Tetteh Quarshie Interchange. Construction works are ongoing, and progress is 32%.\n\nOther important projects include the Kumasi Inner Ring Road, the Volivo Bridge over the Southern Volta River, the Dambai Bridge over the River Oti, and the Adawso Bridge across the Afram River at Adawso.\n\nThe Ministry has received Cabinet approval to reintroduce tolling on roads and bridges nationwide, using advanced technology to improve efficiency, transparency, and revenue generation. Preparatory work is underway to ensure the reintroduction of tolling operations this year.\n\nMr Speaker, there is no doubt that an effective and efficient transport system is integral to any economic development plan. To improve public transport services in the country, government is supporting Intercity STC Coaches Limited (ISTC), Metro Mass Transit Limited (MMTL), and Private Road Transport Operators in renewing their fleets.\n\nA total of 300 buses have been purchased to improve road transport. The initial batch of 100 buses is scheduled to arrive in the country by the end of the first quarter of this year.\n\nMr Speaker, in fulfilment of my pledge to re-establish a national airline, a ten-member task force established to oversee this initiative has submitted a business model and operational framework to guide the selection of a strategic partner for the National Airline. And it shall surely come to pass soon.\n\nPassenger traffic handled by the Ghana Airports Company increased to 3.625 million in 2025, from 3.4 million in 2024. In response to rising passenger traffic and congestion at Accra International Airport's new Terminal 3, we are remodelling Terminal 2 into a dual-purpose facility to serve both domestic and international flights, thereby improving operational efficiency and enhancing the overall passenger experience.\n\nTerminal 3 remains among the best in Africa. A new concourse will link Terminal 2 to Terminal 3, supported by a multi-tier 7-floor car park, an airport hotel, and retail amenities, as well as runway expansion and overlay.\n\nWe will begin work on new regional airports in Sunyani, Bolgatanga and Wa.\n\nMr Speaker, we are working to fully operationalise the Tema-Mpakadan rail line to maximise passenger and freight traffic between Tema and the North using the Volta Lake waterway. The Western and Eastern Railway Lines will continue to be modernised in partnership with the private sector. These projects aim to support the efficient transport of containers and bulk cargo to and from the ports, as well as to facilitate the efficient haulage of minerals from the mines in Nsuta, Awaso, and Nyinahin to the Takoradi Port, while providing passenger transport along the respective corridors.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of the 24-Hour Economy initiative, a new 24-hour operation has started at Tema Port, allowing access to port services around the clock. This development enables importers to clear goods at any time, significantly easing congestion at terminals like Transit, Reefer, and the Golden Jubilee Terminal. The initiative brings together customs, banking, and other relevant agencies to enhance efficiency, lower transaction costs, and boost Ghana's competitiveness as a major trade hub.\n\nCabinet has reviewed the designs and the feasibility study for the Keta Port and directed the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority to present an action plan and a roadmap for the realisation of the project at the earliest possible time. Similarly, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority, as part of its expansion effort, has established a new operational office at the Adenta Bus Terminal in Accra. This modern facility operates around the clock, providing continuous services to improve accessibility and convenience for motorists in the Adentan Municipality and nearby areas.\n\nMr Speaker, under the Rural Telephony and Digital Inclusion Project, implemented through the Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communication (GIFEC) to extend voice and data connectivity to unserved and underserved communities, we targeted the construction of 2,016 Cell Sites. 1,561 Cell Sites have been constructed. Of this number, 1,144 have been activated. Work is ongoing to activate the remaining 417 Sites. Preparations are also well underway to commence construction of the remaining 455 Sites.\n\nUnder the School Connectivity Initiative, over 62,000 digital resources have been uploaded to the Ghana Knowledge & Skills Bank, enabling seamless access across multiple devices—PCs, laptops, tablets, and smartphones—for more than 600,000 users including teachers, students, and researchers.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of the Government’s Reset Agenda to ensure Ghanaian youth acquire essential digital skills for the modern global economy, I launched the One Million Coders Programme in March 2025. The initiative aims to train 1 million Ghanaians in key digital areas, including Data Analytics, Data Protection, Cyber Security, the Metaverse, and Artificial Intelligence, over four years. Phase one of the Programme, the Pilot Phase, saw hundreds of trainees complete their training programmes in person across four training centres in Accra, Kumasi, Sunyani and Bolgatanga. Phase two, which will include virtual sessions, is set to commence this year, with expanded training centres and an increased number of beneficiaries. It is projected that 400,000 Ghanaians will be trained this year.\n\nFight against corruption.\n\nMr Speaker, this remains a defining priority of my government and represents a central pillar of our commitment to good governance, accountability, and the prudent management of public resources.\n\nWe have made progress through strengthened collaboration among law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence institutions, and prosecutors. These efforts have led to the initiation of criminal proceedings and asset forfeiture proceedings against some individuals and entities implicated in financial crimes against the State. But yes, I agree with the sentiments of Ghanaians that we must press harder on the accelerator.\n\nAs of December 2025, EOCO had recovered more than GHS 600 million. The Office has investigated 462 cases, with 15 currently under prosecution, and dismantled transnational car-jacking syndicates, recovering 29 luxury vehicles.\n\nMr Speaker, the Government remains resolute that corruption will not be tolerated, regardless of status or political affiliation. The Attorney General’s Office will continue to use both criminal prosecution and non-conviction-based asset recovery mechanisms to ensure that stolen public resources are returned for national development.\n\nI understand that a large majority of Ghanaians are impatient to see those who abused their trust in office held to account.\n\nThere were periods when, under military regimes and unconstitutional governments, extrajudicial means could be used to exact retribution against persons perceived as corrupt or who had abused the public trust. This may have appeared as swift justice, but many regrettable excesses were recorded.\n\nIn 1992, we overwhelmingly adopted the 1992 constitution to accept governance by the rule of law. On 7th January 2025, I swore before the people of Ghana to uphold the 1992 Constitution. I may be as impatient as everyone else to see justice done, but painstaking investigations must be conducted, dockets must be prepared, charges must be filed, and the accused must have their day in court, including appealing even the smallest points of law to higher courts. This process is necessary to protect us all against abuse or ill-treatment of citizens and to ensure that only those guilty of offences against the state are punished.\n\nAs President Mills of blessed memory said, “The wheels of Justice grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.”\n\nLet me reassert my determination to uphold the accountability of public office holders to the people of Ghana. We have laid the Public Officers Code of Conduct Bill before Parliament. This bill codifies the conduct of public officers and makes breaches thereof punishable. I wish, at this juncture, to thank the Chief Justice for establishing specialised High Courts to address breaches identified in the Auditor General's report.\n\nThe constitution review process was conducted in a transparent, consultative, and participatory manner, drawing on input from constitutional experts, civil society organisations, traditional authorities, political parties, and the public. The review committee has submitted its comprehensive report, containing detailed proposals to amend the Constitution to address identified weaknesses and make it more welfare-enhancing.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office is working closely with relevant stakeholders to translate the recommendations into implementable legal and constitutional proposals, which will be presented to Parliament in accordance with constitutional procedures.\n\nMr Speaker, illegal mining continues to pose a grave threat to our environment, water bodies, public health, and national security. Prosecution of persons engaged in illegal mining has been intensified with a renewed focus on dismantling organised criminal networks behind galamsey operations rather than targeting only low-level offenders.\n\nIn total, over 114 case dockets involving hundreds of accused persons are pending in various courts across the country, particularly in towns and villages prone to illegal mining. Specialised prosecutorial teams have been deployed to fast-track illegal mining cases, ensure the effective presentation of evidence, and pursue the confiscation and forfeiture of equipment and proceeds used in or derived from illegal mining.\n\nMr Speaker, my government will continue to ensure gender equality and equity, promote the welfare and protection of children's rights, and empower the vulnerable, the aged, and persons with disabilities for sustainable national development.\n\nWork is well advanced on the Women’s Development Bank, for which a total of GHS 401 million has been allocated in the 2026 Budget. The coming months should see a full rollout of this monumental policy to empower Ghanaian women and women-owned businesses economically and financially.\n\nMr Speaker, the Ministry of Gender and Social Protection has successfully honoured the LEAP payment cycles for 2025, reaching 1.5 million people. It ensures the full implementation of the Ghana School Feeding Programme in over 12,000 public schools across all 261 districts of the country.\n\nThe number of beneficiary pupils has increased from three million, eight hundred and one thousand, four hundred and ninety-one (3,801,491) for the 2023/2024 academic year to four million, two hundred and thirty-one thousand, and fifty-nine (4,231,059) for the 2024/2025 academic year. The programme is providing gainful employment to 34,000 caterers and cooks nationwide.\n\nMr Speaker, in the security sector, Ghana faces evolving security threats. Our troops, services and agencies have, however, remained firmly committed to strengthening national peace and security, which underpin our democracy, development, and social cohesion. This commitment encompasses internal security operations, international peace support missions, strategic investments in infrastructure and retooling, and improvements in troop welfare, recruitment, and capacity development.\n\nTwo recent incidents are evidence of the increasing dangers we face as a nation. The killing of eight of our citizens who had gone to our neighbouring country to purchase tomatoes, and an attack yesterday on Ghanaian fishermen in our waters by pirates, reinforce the need for us to retool and adequately equip our security services.\n\nI wish to commend the Ghana Armed Forces for conducting a successful medical evacuation of our injured compatriots from Burkina Faso. I also commend the Ghana Navy and Air Force, the National Security Council Secretariat, the Chief of Staff’s Operations Team, the MP for Awutu Senya, the Chief Fisherman and the people of Senya Bereku for the combined effort that successfully rescued the stranded 71 fishermen yesterday.\n\nI have asked the National Security Coordinator to assist the affected fishermen and replace the stolen outboard motors and fishing gear.\n\nThe Armed Forces continues to play a key role in containing illegal small-scale mining (galamsey) through the deployment of River Guards, support for the National Anti-Illegal Mining Operations Secretariat (NAIMOS), and assistance to Special Courts for the swift prosecution of offenders.\n\nMr Speaker, during the year, the Ghana Armed Forces had 2,199 troops with requisite equipment deployed to various peacekeeping missions, reinforcing Ghana’s reputation as a dependable and professional contributor to international peace operations. While Ghana continues to maintain an enviable reputation in international peacekeeping, we note that many of the theatres where we have operated are winding down due to reduced budgets for UN Peace Support Operations.\n\nAs our troops return home, we must create opportunities for them to train, remain active, and stay engaged. Mr Speaker, beyond peacekeeping operations, Ghana continues to demonstrate its strong commitment to international solidarity, humanitarian assistance, and South–South cooperation. In December 2025, the Government deployed 54 personnel from the 14 Engineers Brigade to Jamaica to support national reconstruction efforts following the devastation caused by Hurricane Melissa, which claimed over 40 lives.\n\nIn recognition of the scale of the recovery effort, the Government approved a request from the Government of Jamaica to extend Operation BOAFO, Ghana’s humanitarian deployment, from its initial 30-day mandate to 90 days.\n\nMr Speaker, to further improve operational readiness, the Government will continue to invest in vital defence infrastructure and retooling. The construction of a Forward Operating Base at Ezinlibo, situated along the western maritime corridor, is ongoing. This facility aims to boost maritime surveillance and better protect offshore oil and gas installations. The Northern Border Security Project, initiated to counter terrorism and transnational crime, is advancing decisively. This project constitutes the first line of defence against infiltration and extremist threats, significantly strengthening surveillance.\n\nPlans are well advanced to establish 2 additional military barracks in Ajumako, Central Region, and Dambai, Oti Region, to address emerging security concerns and strengthen state presence in these areas. To further support retooling efforts, agreements have been signed to procure and deliver four helicopters and one jet for the Ghana Air Force, aimed at replacing the ageing fleet and modernising our air capabilities.\n\nThe Ghana Armed Forces is carrying out a thorough overhaul of previously grounded aircraft, which involves replacing essential components. This aims to quickly restore operational readiness and maximise fleet availability.\n\nMr Speaker, I am pleased to announce that I have commissioned 50 vehicles for the Ghana Armed Forces to enhance operational mobility and boost troop morale. It forms part of a broader government programme to retool the military and improve logistics across the services. Plans are underway to acquire two offshore patrol vessels, armoured personnel carriers, protective gear, ammunition, vehicles, strategic drones, and advanced communication systems to enhance the operational capabilities of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n\nMr Speaker, we will continue to prioritise human capital development within the Forces. A progressive recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Ghana Armed Forces by 12,000 personnel over four years to support expansion and operational demands is ongoing. In line with the Government’s reset agenda, the recruitment process has been decentralised to regional capitals, with selected recruits reporting directly from their regions to training schools, marking a significant shift from the previous Accra-centred system.\n\nI wish to express my condolences to the families of our young daughters who died during the stampede at the El Wak Stadium. May their memory be blessed and may they rest in perfect peace. Following the revised gratuity regime introduced in 2020 under Constitutional Instrument 129, arrears have accumulated because no budgetary provision was made in the four years that followed. This has resulted in over one billion Ghana cedis owed to approximately three thousand personnel across different ranks.\n\nMr Speaker, as part of our commitment to fairness and the resolution of long-standing legacy issues, the Government will soon commence payment of gratuity arrears under CI 129. Following engagements initiated by the current Military High Command with the Ministry of Finance and Defence, a structured implementation plan has been agreed upon. This will bring closure to an issue that has been outstanding since 2020 and ensure that affected personnel receive their rightful entitlements.\n\nThe Ghana Police Service has also received 40 armoured vehicles and 100 pick-up trucks to enhance its operations. Other security agencies, such as the Fire, Prisons, Immigration, BNI and the Narcotics Control Commission, will also be retooled to enhance their efficiency. I wish to commend the IGP and his men for the recent major success in bringing dangerous criminals to justice. The trust of Ghanaians in their police service is rising, and I urge you to keep up the standard.\n\nMr Speaker, Ghana’s foreign policy remains a central instrument for advancing our national development, safeguarding our sovereignty and projecting our values on the global stage. At a time when the global environment is characterised by profound geopolitical shifts, economic uncertainty, climate-related challenges, and evolving security concerns within our sub-region, the Government has taken deliberate steps to ensure that Ghana’s engagement with the world is purposeful, strategic, and responsive to the needs of our people.\n\nIn this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has stepped up efforts to align Ghana’s external relations with our domestic development priorities.\n\nMr Speaker, in West Africa, Ghana continues to pursue a policy of good neighbourliness, solidarity and constructive cooperation with all countries in the sub-region. We remain firmly committed to the vision of a peaceful, stable, prosperous and integrated West Africa, grounded in mutual respect, dialogue and collective responsibility.\n\nWe must sustain engagement and deepen relations with the AES member states, particularly following their withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Ghana believes that continued dialogue and cooperation are indispensable to regional stability and that disengagement only deepens vulnerabilities.\n\nAt the continental level, Ghana continues to play an active, principled and forward-looking role in advancing the African Union’s strategic priorities. Ghana currently holds the following prestigious positions: AU Champion on Reparations and AU Champion for African Financial Institutions. Ghana is also the AU Champion for gender equality and women's empowerment.\n\nMr Speaker, I am humbled by Ghana’s election as the First Vice Chairperson of the African Union (AU) at the 39th Ordinary Session of the AU Assembly of Heads of State and Government held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. It is also gratifying to note that my colleague leaders in West Africa have declared me, John Dramani Mahama, the region’s sole candidate for the position of Chairperson of the African Union when the rotating chairmanship returns to West Africa in 2027.\n\nMr Speaker, during the 80th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, I raised Ghana’s voice to call for a comprehensive ‘reset’ of the United Nations to better reflect current realities, particularly the role of Africa in global governance and fairness in international financial systems. In line with our multilateral commitments, Ghana announced plans to table a UN resolution recognising the Transatlantic Slave Trade as the greatest crime against humanity and promoting an agenda of acknowledgement, reparative justice, and cultural restitution.\n\nI will formally present the resolution, which has been endorsed and adopted by the African Union, to the UN in March this year for consideration by the UN General Assembly. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established 7 new Passport Application Centres in the Upper East, Oti, Ahafo, Bono East, North East, Savannah and Western North Regions. With this expansion, all sixteen (16) regional capitals now host passport application centres, marking a major milestone in the decentralisation of passport services.\n\nMr Speaker, to address systemic delays, the ministry implemented a 24-hour passport production operation at the Head Office, enabling the clearance of an inherited backlog of over 40,000 passport applications. As a result of these reforms, Ghana’s passport administration now operates with zero backlog, guaranteeing passport delivery within 15 working days nationwide. To facilitate travel, boost tourism and ease business mobility, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs implemented a five-day visa processing service across Ghana’s Missions abroad.\n\nConcurrently, significant progress has been made in the design and procurement phases of a national electronic visa (e-Visa) platform, with a targeted rollout planned for 2026. Ghana has also secured new visa waiver agreements with 11 countries to facilitate people-to-people exchanges, trade, and investment.\n\nMr Speaker, to highlight Ghana’s ongoing commitments to international solidarity, we made significant humanitarian donations to Jamaica, Cuba, Sudan, and Palestine to support disaster relief and conflict-related crises. These donations, amounting to millions of cedis, included food, medicine, clothing, and cocoa products.\n\nMr Speaker, I am pleased to report that remittances from Ghanaians abroad reached a historic high of $7.8 billion in 2025. This is the largest annual inflow ever recorded. This reflects not only confidence in our economy but the enduring patriotism of our citizens living and working across the world.\n\nThese remittances support households, finance education, build homes, seed businesses, and stabilise our foreign exchange position. In many respects, our diaspora has become one of the country’s most reliable development partners, without contracts, conditionalities, or fanfare.\n\nWe must intentionally ensure that citizenship, rather than place of residence, determines one’s right to serve the Republic. Ghanaians worldwide who pledge allegiance to this country and make substantial contributions to its development should not be barred from active participation in public affairs, including the opportunity to hold public office, provided there are appropriate measures to ensure loyalty and accountability.\n\nI am, personally, in support of the bipartisan bill currently before Parliament seeking to address this matter.\n\nMr Speaker, youth development and empowerment are at the core of everything we are trying to achieve. We are implementing many policies to develop our youth's capacity and to create as many jobs as possible to address the major unemployment problem. All our youth activities and job creation programmes are ongoing. In 2025, 10,887 young people were trained in entrepreneurship programmes and job creation under the Adwumawura programme. In 2026, an additional 10,000 young people will receive similar support under the programme.\n\nThe National Apprenticeship Programme onboarded 14,000 young people during the pilot phase, and they have started receiving start-up kits. Training is ongoing across the regions, and when completed, the trainees will be certified by the Commission for TVET to facilitate access to employment.\n\nMr Speaker, this year, the target for the National Apprenticeship Programme has been increased from 10,000 to 100,000 young people, offering many more young people the opportunity to acquire the skills needed for sustainable employment.\n\nIn 2025, 86,000 young people were engaged through the Youth Employment Agency (YEA)'s various employment modules. This year, I have directed the Ministry of Youth Development and Empowerment to, as a matter of urgency, review all the youth employment modules under the YEA to reduce duplication and ensure value for money. This is important to channel the resources to the advantage of the teeming youth waiting for opportunities.\n\nThe National Service Authority has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Defence to commence military training for 10,000 National Service Personnel in the 2025/2026 service year. This was a programme our late Minister for Defence, Dr Edward Omane Boamah, was desirous of seeing to full execution. I charge the NSA and the GAF to bring life into the exercise for the benefit of the personnel and the training of our youth.\n\nMr. Speaker, my government has launched a wide range of initiatives aimed at transforming Ghana’s trade, agribusiness, and industrial sectors to boost our competitiveness in export markets, encourage value addition, and generate employment for Ghana's large youth population. My recent visit with the Minister for Trade, Agribusiness and Industry, to inaugurate new factories and expansion works, convinced me that Ghana is on the right track for industrial transformation.\n\nThe ministry has begun implementing policies in the areas of textiles and garment manufacturing, pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturing, automotive and component manufacturing, and contract farming and agro-processing. As a first step, we are collaborating with the private sector to establish three garment factories in the Eastern, Central, and Bono East regions, creating an estimated 27,000 jobs.\n\nMr Speaker, this government will fulfil its commitment to revive key state-owned enterprises. The Ministry is in the process of sourcing strategic investors to operationalise the Komenda Sugar Factory, Volta Star Textiles, Pwalugu Tomato Factory, Zuarungu Meat Factory and the Akosombo Textiles Limited.\n\nGhana’s Non-Traditional Exports recorded a 27.04% growth in 2025 with total earnings of $4.87 billion, up from $3.83 billion in 2024. This reflects a very early impact of the Accelerated Export Development Programme (AEDP), launched only last year, and demonstrates the continued resilience and expanding contribution of the Non-Traditional Exports sector to Ghana’s export economy.\n\nMr Speaker, the mining sub-sector remains a cornerstone of Ghana’s economic development, making substantial contributions to employment creation, export earnings, and government revenue. According to the Ghana Statistical Service, the mining and quarrying sub-sector accounted for 17.4 per cent of the overall 33.8 per cent industry share of Gross Domestic Product in 2025, emerging as the leading contributor within the industrial sector. The sector generated export earnings of approximately $15.25 billion, accounting for 65.37 per cent of Ghana’s total export receipts, out of a total of $23.33 billion.\n\nThe abolition of Value Added Tax (VAT) on mineral exploration activities is expected to significantly reduce upfront costs for investors, improve project economics, and stimulate increased greenfield and brownfield exploration across the country\n\nMr Speaker, the fight against galamsey remains complex and demands a multidimensional response that integrates strong enforcement, the application of technology, sound regulation, and active community participation. The Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources, in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, the Ghana Revenue Authority (Customs), and the Ministry of Finance, has registered 1,808 pieces of earth-moving and mining equipment at the port, of which 1,033 are being tracked.\n\nThe protection of our water bodies and forest reserves is ongoing with the deployment of 1,634 Blue Water Guards across the Western, Western North, Savannah, Upper West, Bono, Eastern, Ashanti, Central, Volta and Northern Regions. This nationwide deployment aims to strengthen surveillance, improve rapid response, and enhance on-the-ground enforcement against illegal mining activities that threaten critical water sources, forest ecosystems and livelihoods. NAIMOS will maintain regular, coordinated operations across all twenty-one (21) identified hotspots to prevent re-entry. While temporary deployments yielded positive results, they proved insufficient for sustained enforcement.\n\nMr Speaker, the Works, Housing and Water sub-sectors are vital pillars of Ghana’s national development, shaping sustainable livelihoods through a reliable water supply and affordable housing that enhance citizens' well-being. Sea defence works are ongoing. We have successfully completed works at Komenda, Ningo–Prampram and Elmina. Together, these three projects have protected approximately 15 km of coastline and safeguarded lives, livelihoods and property.\n\nIn March 2025, I visited Solakope, Agavedzi, and Amutinu in the Ketu South Municipality, where tidal waves had displaced thousands of residents. We made a firm commitment to address the devastation. True to that promise, the contract for Phase 2 of the Blekusu Coastal Protection Project was awarded, and in August last year, I officially broke ground to commence the project. The project is currently 25% complete, and calm has already been restored along the coastline.\n\nNotwithstanding these actions, flooding remains a major infrastructural challenge in the country and a top priority for this government. A task force on flooding is in place and coordinating the national mitigation efforts.\n\nMr Speaker, Ghana continues to grapple with a housing deficit currently estimated at over 1.8 million units. Some significant strides have been made in the housing sector. In line with the Government's earlier commitments to complete all ongoing housing initiatives, we have successfully concluded the Joint Venture arrangement for the completion of the Saglemi Housing Project.\n\nThe Attorney General is reviewing all related documentation to finalise and commence the project. TDC Ghana is also steadily advancing work on 800 housing units under the Kpone Affordable Housing Project at Tema Community 26.\n\nTo position TDC Ghana as a key player in Ghana’s housing industry, I performed the sod-cutting ceremony last year for the Oxygen City Housing Project in Ho. That project seeks to address Ghana’s housing deficit by developing 1,000 affordable housing units. We have also continued with our resettlement housing efforts for the victims of the Akosombo Dam Spillage, with 251 of the planned 1,010 housing units in critical impact zones already under construction. Collectively, these initiatives demonstrate the government’s continued resolve to expand access to affordable housing, strengthen urban planning, and provide relief to affected communities.\n\nMr Speaker, Ghana’s renewable water resources are estimated at about 54 billion cubic meters, with over 70% derived from the Volta Basin shared among six riparian nations. We are implementing key interventions to expand and improve water services nationwide. The following urban water supply projects are at various stages of completion: the Keta Water Supply Project, the Wenchi Water Supply Project, and the Sekondi-Takoradi Water Supply Project.\n\nI am happy to announce that Anyako has good, clean drinking water today, and the Community Water and Sanitation Agency will commission the project next week. It will also serve the island community of Seva.\n\nWe will begin preparatory work on the Damango and Sunyani Water Supply Expansion Projects and seek to finalise all financing arrangements for other water supply projects in Tamale, Yendi, Techiman, and Tarkwa. The Danish Government has allocated grant support to improve water supply services in low-income and high-density areas in Wa and Bolgatanga, aiming to address water challenges and provide relief to vulnerable populations.\n\nMr Speaker, the following Rural Water Supply Projects are ongoing: Asankragwa, Sefwi Wiawso, Duadaso, Kweiman Danfa, Goaso, Juaben, Aveyime, and Adum Banso.\n\nTo strictly follow the Resetting Agenda and secure sufficient funding, the Ministry of Finance has allocated GHS 6.3 billion to the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF). This amount covers four quarters of the 2025 fiscal year and is allocated to all 261 Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies (MMDAs) to execute their activities outlined in the Medium-Term Development Plans and Annual Action Plans (AAPs). Out of the amount released, a total of GHS 4.3 billion has been disbursed to all MMDAs. The 4th Quarter instalment is being processed for disbursement.\n\nIn fulfilment of the Government’s commitment to strengthen local governance and decentralisation, the Ministry has, for the first time in the history of local governance, disbursed a total of GHS 100 million in monthly allowances to all Assembly Members. The Ministry of Local Government, Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, has finalised the designs for the 24-Hour Economy Modern Markets to be adopted and constructed by all MMDAs. Procurement processes are far advanced to commence the construction of the 24-Hour Markets.\n\nTourism and Culture. Our creative arts sector has so much to offer. Creatives using new media are giving our nation greater prominence than we could achieve through any first-class media outlet.\n\nOur economy will not be built only by traditional sectors but also by human-creativity sectors that will absorb those displaced from the shop floor by new AI technologies.\n\nGhana has become a favourite tourist destination because of our history, culture, arts, music, fashion, and food. The government has allocated GHS 20 million to the film sector alone and another GHS 20 million to the broader creative sector. I will be your personal ambassador for the tourism and creative sector.\n\nGovernment will, in line with a new national MICE and Creative Events strategy, undertake the refurbishment of the Accra International Conference Centre to restore it to its iconic status as the country’s national and international events and conference venue.\n\nThe original contractors of the Centre, EnergoProjekt Ghana Limited, have conducted a structural integrity assessment at the request of the Chief of Staff and made recommendations for the facility's renovation and refurbishment. They will commence the works in the next few weeks.\n\nBut, Mr Speaker, the AICC is not enough for a country seeking to develop its creative sector and become West Africa’s destination for meetings, musical concerts, entertainment, and conferences. Working with the private sector, work will also commence this year on a befitting Convention and Creative Events Centre to position Ghana as West Africa’s leading hub for Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions, and Creative Events. The government will also begin this year the renovation of the State Banquet Hall, which has been closed for a couple of years.\n\nMr Speaker, this year, we will strengthen Ghana’s standing in major global and continental sports events. We will make our 5th FIFA World Cup appearance, and for us, this is an opportunity to boost national branding and the economy beyond just sports. The Black Queens will compete at the 2026 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations, building on their bronze medal finish in Morocco. At the youth level, Ghana will participate in the 2026 Youth Olympic Games in Dakar with a multi-disciplinary team aimed at strengthening long-term elite pathways. We will also compete at the Commonwealth Games 2026 in Glasgow, reinforcing Ghana’s presence across the Commonwealth sporting landscape.\n\nMr Speaker, as a member of the Ghana Journalist Association, I have been deeply concerned about abuses suffered by journalists at the hands of some errant security personnel. I have asked the leadership of the security agencies to take firm action and to reorient their men and women on the need to be accommodating to journalists who are only doing their job of keeping citizens informed. I have also been concerned about the state of the State-owned media, almost all of which have suffered from historical underfunding and are grappling with deteriorating infrastructure and facilities.\n\nI recently toured these media houses to learn about their challenges, and we are currently putting together a revitalisation plan to leverage their valuable assets and reinject life into their operations. The reintroduction of the Media Development Fund is also being reconsidered to support the Ghanaian media.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nMr Speaker, during my recent trip to Zambia, we saw what a united Ghana can achieve on the global stage. A simple mislabeling of our culture could have reduced us to a punchline. Instead, we moved with speed and confidence. We corrected the record. We turned ridicule into reach. We turned confusion into connection. We turned what could have been a negative social media trend into a handshake of friendship with our Zambian brothers and sisters.\n\nFor most, that episode was just a fleeting social media frenzy. Yet it served a greater purpose. It showed a nation that understands its brand equity. It showed citizens aligned around a common identity. It showed a country that knows who we are and refuses to be defined by others. But let us be honest. Unity in moments of cultural pride has proved easier than unity in moments of political disagreement. If we can mobilise that same collective resolve for our development agenda, we will see real progress.\n\nThat mobilisation is possible. We are the descendants of a people who united against political subjugation, resisted economic exploitation, and fought oppression.\n\nMr Speaker, our pursuit of national development today demands the same unity. We must reject misrepresentation and distortion that detract from our collective progress. We must guard our development as firmly as we guard our identity. And we must act as one people with one purpose.\n\nMr Speaker, in public life, there is a simple maxim we are all very familiar with: the buck stops with the President. I not only agree with this; every day I hold the office of President, I live by it. The ultimate responsibility for the direction of this nation rests with the office I hold, and I would never shirk that duty. But nation-building is not merely a question of who provides strategic direction and who bears final responsibility.\n\nIt is the long chain of effort that carries intent into reality — from policy conception to laws enacted, to resources mobilised, to services delivered, to value created on farms, in workshops, in classrooms, in markets, and in enterprises across our land. It is here that the strength of a Republic reveals itself: in the countless acts of competence, integrity, and industry by citizens of every calling, whose work turns national purpose into lived reality.\n\nWhile the buck may stop at the Presidency, the work of nation-building goes beyond it; through the labour, enterprise, and civic spirit of millions of Ghanaians, whose daily efforts give policy life. I will continue to carry the weight of final accountability. And I ask, in equal measure, that our citizens bring their full measure of energy, skill, and patriotism to the common task of advancing our country.\n\nThat is how nations build influence. That is how economies grow. No policy can substitute for civic duty. No programme can replace the quiet discipline with which millions of Ghanaians sustain their families, serve their communities, and carry this Republic forward each day.\n\nMr Speaker, we are sometimes tempted to judge our nation only by the failures and difficulties we face. But a country is not defined solely by its burdens. It is defined by the choices its people make in response to them. Repeatedly throughout our history, Ghanaians have chosen steadiness over despair, cooperation over division, and purpose over cynicism. That is the deeper strength on which our future rests. We have faced testing moments before. Periods of economic strain. Transitions that have demanded much from our citizens and public servants alike.\n\nMr Speaker, there is an old African proverb, (QUOTE) “However long the night, the dawn will break.” (UNQUOTE)\n\nThe dawn is breaking for Ghana. The moment we are in requires not only endurance but also action. It reminds us that renewal belongs to those who prepare for the morning, while others still speak of darkness. For Ghana today, that dawn is not a promise we recite. It is a reality we must build into our institutions, in our economy, and in the ethic of responsibility we pass on to the next generation.\n\nSo let us live each day, mindful that the Republic is larger than any one political party, any office, or any moment. This Republic belongs equally to the farmer and the trader, the teacher and the nurse, the artisan and the entrepreneur, the young citizen just finding her voice and the elder who has carried faith in this nation for decades. Each has a stake. Each has a duty. Each has a claim on the future we shape together.\n\nMr Speaker, nations endure not because they are spared trial, but because their people refuse surrender. Ghana has been tested before. We did not yield then. We will not yield now. And so, with gratitude for how far we have come, and with resolve for the work ahead, I say, Mr Speaker, the State of our Nation is resilient, the state of our nation is renewing, and our nation is firmly in the hands of its people.\n\nI thank you for your attention.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Mayor of Accra, Michael Kpakpo Allotey, has assured traders at Makola No. 2 Market that a proposed rent increase and a disputed 20 per cent charge will not take effect for now, as the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) begins discussions with the facility’s managers to address concerns raised by the traders.\n\nThe assurance came during a working visit to the market on Thursday, February 26, after traders closed their shops in protest. The action disrupted business at one of Accra’s busiest commercial centres.\n\nThe traders said they were protesting what they described as unfair rent conditions and the imposition of a 20 per cent charge at the facility, which they have occupied for more than 30 years. The market is reported to be owned by SSNIT.\n\nThey also complained that parts of the rent, including sanitation and maintenance fees, were not reflected in visible improvements at the market. According to them, conditions at the facility have deteriorated even as charges continue to rise.\n\nAddressing the traders, the Mayor clarified that the proposed rent increment was not directed by the President or the central government. He stressed that he had not authorised any rent increase.\n\nHe acknowledged the economic difficulties facing traders and said the government understands their situation. He assured them that the AMA would engage the facility’s management to review the matter and work towards an amicable solution.\n\nUntil those discussions are concluded, he said, rent levels should remain unchanged.\n\nThe Mayor added that any future rent adjustment must be linked to clear improvements in the market’s infrastructure and services. He indicated that increases would not be justified if conditions at the facility do not improve.\n\nAs part of immediate steps to improve the trading environment, he announced that the AMA would take over sanitation management in the area. This includes clearing accumulated refuse around the market.\n\nHe encouraged traders to channel their concerns through the AMA, noting that he operates an open-door policy and remains accessible to all residents, including the vulnerable.\n\nThe Mayor appealed for calm and patience, assuring the traders that their concerns had been heard and that steps were being taken to resolve the issue through dialogue.\n\nSome traders who spoke after the engagement expressed appreciation for the intervention.\n\nThey thanked President John Dramani Mahama and the Mayor for what they described as a responsive approach, saying the visit had renewed their hope that the matter would be resolved and their businesses protected from what they consider excessive charges.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "ECG denies return of dumsor in Ashanti region.\n\nThe Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) has dismissed rumors that the Ashanti Region is experiencing a return to “Dumsor”, the colloquial term for persistent and scheduled power outages.\n\nThe region has been experiencing intermittent power outages in recent days, adversely impacting domestic and commercial consumers.\n\nThe power situation also affected the Ghana Water Company’s ability to pump water from both Owabi and Barekese dams.\n\nBut the Electricity Company of Ghana insists there is no load management or scheduled power shedding.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of all four regional managers of ECG in the Ashanti Region after a technical meeting on Wednesday, General Manager for Ashanti East, Ing Daniel Mensah-Asare, admits some residents have been experiencing what he described as power interruptions.\n\nAccording to him, the interruptions are mainly due to isolated technical faults rather than a systemic shortage of power.\n\n“It is a big no! There’s nothing like load management, load shedding, or what is popularly called Dumsor; no, there's no ‘dumsor’ in any part of the Ashanti Region.\n\nThere's no Dumsor in any part of Ghana.\" Ing Mensah-Asare told JoyNews.\n\nIng. Daniel Mensah-Asare is the General Manager for the Ashanti East Region of ECG\n\n\"What people are probably seeing are a few outages. They are all as a result of a fault that some of them are taking a little time for us to fix due to the nature of the fault.\n\nBut I want to say emphatically that there's no ‘dumsor’ or there's no load shedding or load management.” He added.\n\nTo tackle these technical challenges, Ing Mensah-Asare highlighted the reinforcement of a proactive maintenance program launched last year, dubbed \"Operation Keep the Light On.\"\n\nThe initiative involves defect identification, where technicians patrol distribution lines that are 11 kV and 33 kV to find potential failure points before they cause an outage, and defect correction, which involves immediate repairs to remove hazards.\n\nIn recent times, the program has been expanded to include the low-voltage networks that connect directly to individual residences.\n\nECG denies return of dumsor in Ashanti Region\n\n“There's a programme ongoing from last year that we call Operation Keep the Light On, which mandates us to go on our networks or our distribution lines, identify things that can possibly lead to an outage or can cause the light to go off.\n\nSo we are doing what we call a defect identification. Then we follow it up with defect correction.\n\nWe've done that on the majority of our distribution network or lines, 11 kV and 33 kV lines.\n\nWe have now expanded it to cover every 11 kV and 33 kV network. And we are even extending it to our distribution network, that one we call the low voltage network, the one that is connecting to your houses, so that we send teams or we send our men, our technicians, our engineers to go on the line and see potential things that can cause the light to go off.\n\nThen we follow it up immediately to correct that defect.”\n\nBut it appears residents in Kumasi hit by water shortage will have to wait a little longer as ECG addresses the power concerns at the Barekese Dam.\n\nIng Mensah-Asare is not sure when a project to provide reliable power supply to the Barekese Dam could be completed.\n\n“There is an ongoing project there that is going to ensure that the water company gets enough power or a reliable power to pump water for all of us and that we know and we are working very hard on it to make sure that that problem is resolved,\" he said.\n\n\"It will not be too long,” Ing Mensah-Asare stressed.\n\nThe General Manager has urged the public to stay informed through ECG's social media flyers and local radio announcements, which provide real-time updates and restoration timelines for any localized faults.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Within her is the power to create, nurture, and transform,” a sentiment organisers say was reflected in her swift response when her name was mentioned during the initiative.\n\nAccording to the team behind the drive, Mrs Peprah did not hesitate to step forward, declaring that “there’s no time to waste.”\n\nIn a symbolic gesture underscoring continuity and shared responsibility, Mrs Peprah arrived with the very individual she intended to nominate — Benjamin Zigorsh-Nyakpenu, First Deputy Registrar of Companies.\n\nThe moment, described as a real-time passing of the torch, reinforced the campaign’s focus on sustaining a chain of generosity in support of the Ghana Medical Trust Fund.\n\nMr Zigorsh-Nyakpenu has since extended the momentum by nominating Richard Nunekpeku, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod), and Alhassan Yakubu Abanga, Vice Chairman of the National Democratic Congress (NDC).\n\nThe nominations form part of a broader effort to rally leaders and citizens alike to demonstrate practical compassion through giving to the Ghana Medical Trust Fund.\n\nOrganisers are urging the public to join the Kyerɛ Wo Dɔ Drive and contribute to the Ghana Medical Trust Fund.\n\nDonations can be made by dialling *255# on all networks or through direct bank transfers to National Investment Bank, Airport Branch (Account No: 1135105341202) and First Atlantic Bank, Head Office Branch (Account No: 2613171101016). “Truly, we care,” the organisers emphasised.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "A new children’s book by Ghanaian food storyteller Bibiana Gyasi (Cheflifestyle) is placing culture, confidence, and literacy at the centre of early childhood development.\n\nSet to launch on February 28, 2026 ahead of Ghana Month celebrations, the book transforms familiar Ghanaian kitchen tools and everyday kitchen experiences into imaginative storytelling making culture accessible, joyful, and relatable for children.\n\nWhile Bibiana is widely known for documenting Ghanaian cuisine and travel over the past six years, this project shifts her storytelling from digital platforms into children’s literature with a deeper focus on generational impact.\n\nRooted in Identity\n\nIn an era where global media dominates bookshelves and screens, many children both in Ghana and in the diaspora are exposed to foreign narratives long before they fully understand their own cultural context.\n\nBibiana believes early representation matters.\n\n“When children see themselves reflected in stories, in the food they eat, the homes they recognise, the language they hear, it builds confidence and belonging,” she notes.\n\nHer book responds to this gap by embedding literacy within familiar local contexts. Kitchens become classrooms. Ingredients become storytellers. Everyday Ghanaian experiences become meaningful narratives.\n\nWhy Food?\n\nFood carries history. It carries migration, memory, and meaning. Yet many families today are disconnected from the origins and cultural significance behind everyday meals.\n\nThrough this book, Bibiana uses food as a gateway to identity helping children understand that what they eat is not ordinary, but part of a larger cultural story.\n\nBeyond the Book\n\nMore than a standalone publication, the book forms the foundation of a broader cultural literacy initiative designed to extend into schools and communities across Ghana.\n\nPlanned activities include:\n\nStructured school tours featuring interactive reading sessions\n\nLiteracy and storytelling workshops\n\nCreative cooking sessions introducing children to hands-on cultural learning\n\nBook donation drives to underserved schools and communities\n\nThe initiative aims to address two pressing concerns simultaneously: declining reading culture and weakening cultural identity among young people.\n\nBuilding Cultural Confidence\n\nWith this project, Bibiana Gyasi expands her role from food influencer to cultural educator — positioning storytelling as both preservation and empowerment.\n\nThe initiative is currently open to collaboration with NGOs, corporate brands, CSR departments, educational institutions, and foundations aligned with youth development, literacy, and cultural sustainability.\n\nAs Ghana celebrates its heritage in March, Bibiana’s children’s book signals a broader movement: one that ensures the next generation grows up not only reading stories but recognising themselves within them.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Business News of Friday, 27 February 2026\n\nSource: Ghana Energy Awards\n\nThe Ghana Energy Awards has officially launched activities marking its 10th Anniversary Edition with a high-level courtesy call on the Ministry of Energy and Green Transition, setting the tone for a landmark year for the prestigious industry recognition scheme.\n\n\n\nThe delegation, led by the Chief Executive Officer of the Awards Secretariat, Ing. Henry Teinor, and the Chairman of the Awarding Panel, Kwame Jantuah, Esq. Other members of the delegation included Dr. Lawrence Tetteh and Dr. Jemima Nunoo.\n\n\n\nThe broader Awarding Panel also includes H.E. Dr. Kwame Ampofo, Ghana's Ambassador to the Republic of Hungary, and Prof. Felix Asante, Pro Vice-Chancellor of the University of Ghana, in charge of Research, Innovation and Development.\n\n\n\nThe team was received by the Deputy Minister of Energy and Green Transition, Hon. Richard Gyan-Mensah, on behalf of the Minister, Hon. Dr. John Abdulai Jinapor.\n\n\n\nThe meeting, held at the Ministry in Accra, marks the first in a series of activities lined up to commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Awards, which, since 2017, has recognised excellence and innovation across Ghana’s energy value chain.\n\n\n\nAmong key items discussed was the formal presentation of the Site Visitation Report from the 9th Ghana Energy Awards, alongside deliberations on the theme selection and roadmap for the 10th Edition. The delegation also used the occasion to exchange perspectives with the Ministry on strategic priorities for 2026 and areas for collaboration.\n\n\n\nIndependent Assessment to Support Oversight\n\n\n\nPresenting the Site Visitation Report, Chairman of the Awarding Panel, Kwame Jantuah, Esq., underscored the importance of the exercise as an independent technical assessment of selected project sites visited during last year’s awards process.\n\n\n\n“The Site Visitation Report provides an independent, expert assessment of operational sites and projects reviewed by the Panel,” Jantuah said. “We believe this document can serve as a useful reference point to support policy refinement and strengthen the Ministry’s oversight responsibilities across the sector.”\n\nHe noted that the Awards’ structured evaluation process, including site visits and technical reviews, reinforces credibility and provides actionable insights for both regulators and operators.\n\n\n\nCommitment to Excellence\n\n\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Awards Secretariat, Ing. Henry Teinor, reiterated the scheme’s commitment to promoting excellence and strengthening the sector’s long-term development.\n\n\n\n“As we mark our 10th Anniversary, we remain committed to championing operational excellence, innovation and good governance within Ghana’s energy sector,” Ing. Teinor said. “This anniversary is a renewed pledge to support the advancement of the sector in alignment with national priorities.”\n\n\n\nHe described the courtesy call as the formal opener to a broader calendar of anniversary activities, which will include stakeholder engagements, policy dialogues and commemorative events leading up to the awards ceremony later in the year.\n\n\n\nMinistry Reaffirms Strategic Priorities\n\n\n\nDeputy Minister Richard Gyan-Mensah commended the execution of the 9th Edition of the Awards and welcomed the roadmap shared for the 10th Anniversary.\n\n\n\n“The Ministry acknowledges the strategic role the Ghana Energy Awards continues to play in highlighting performance and encouraging healthy competition within the sector,” he said. “The 9th Edition was well executed, and with the roadmap presented, we expect an even more impactful 10th Anniversary celebration.”\n\n\n\nHe reiterated the Ministry’s openness to collaborative initiatives that align with the government’s broader energy vision.\n\n\n\n“We remain open to partnerships that help advance the government’s objectives for the sector and inspire industry players to give their best, champion excellence and pursue innovation,” the Deputy Minister said.\n\n\n\nOutlining the Ministry’s key objectives for 2026, Gyan-Mensah disclosed that the government is working “around the clock” to ensure Ghana achieves a 90% electricity access rate by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nHe further highlighted Ghana’s recent ratification of a $2 billion agreement extending the Jubilee and TEN oil field licences to 2040. The deal, approved in February 2026 and involving Tullow Oil, Kosmos Energy, PetroSA and the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), secures investment for up to 20 new wells aimed at boosting production. It also increases GNPC’s stake by 10% from 2036 and is expected to enhance the domestic gas supply for power generation.\n\n\n\nThe Deputy Minister added that Ghana has reached an agreement with Nigeria to increase gas supply to support power generation, while discussions are ongoing regarding the country’s nuclear energy pathway, including whether to pursue small modular reactors or large-scale nuclear facilities.\n\n\n\nHe also disclosed renewed efforts to ensure malfunctioning streetlights are fixed nationwide to improve public lighting and safety.\n\n\n\nA Landmark Year Ahead\n\n\n\nThe 10th Ghana Energy Awards is expected to reflect a decade of recognising industry leadership and impact. Further details on anniversary activities, stakeholder engagements and the official theme for the 10th Edition will be announced in the coming weeks."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

Carney has previously said he wanted to more than double two-way trade with India by 2030, eyeing an annual target of $51bn.\n\nIndia, for its part, is seeking to attract more overseas investments, and says Canadian pension and wealth funds have already invested $73bn.\n\nThe energy-hungry country, which is considered the world’s fastest-growing major economy, also hopes Canada can support its ambitious plan to expand nuclear power capacity.\n\n\n\nTensions at ‘forefront of minds’\n\nDuring his trip, Carney will also need to work on resetting damaged relations between the two countries, which nosedived after deadly attacks against Sikh activists in Canada several years ago.\n\nThe administration of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Modi’s government of orchestrating the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a naturalised Canadian citizen who was part of a group advocating for an independent Sikh state called Khalistan.\n\nIndia has repeatedly dismissed the allegations, which sent diplomatic relations into freefall, with both nations expelling a string of top diplomats in 2024.\n\nAsked whether Canadian concerns about transnational repression would feature at the New Delhi talks, Foreign Minister Anita Anand told reporters: “That is always at the forefront of our minds.”\n\nAfter India, Carney will visit Australia, where he will address parliament and discuss military, trade and defence links.\n\nEn route back to Ottawa, Carney will meet Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and talk about boosting trade in cars, energy and critical minerals."

            "content": "England seal top spot in Group 2 at T20 World Cup in Super Eights stage with four-wicket win against New Zealand.\n\nEngland topped their Super Eights group at the T20 World Cup with a four-wicket win against New Zealand, which leaves the latter nervously waiting on Pakistan’s final match at this stage.\n\nTournament co-hosts Sri Lanka are already eliminated, but host Pakistan on Saturday in Pallekele.\n\nIf Pakistan are to join England in progressing to the semifinals, they must not only win the match but do so by a margin that will overcome New Zealand’s net run-rate advantage.\n\nEngland’s win against New Zealand at R Premadasa Stadium on Friday, was led by Player of the Match Will Jacks as the 2010 and 2022 champions’ chase overcame their opponents’ 159-7.\n\nThe early loss of openers Phil Salt and Jos Buttler, leaving their side on 2-2 after eight balls, put England’s chances of winning the match in doubt.\n\nWhen captain Harry Brook and Jacob Bethell fell in the space of eight runs to leave England 58-4 in the ninth, the Kiwis looked as though they might turn the screw.\n\nWill Jacks and Rehan Ahmed (32 and 19) were the heroes to see it home for England in an unbeaten seventh-wicket partnership of 44.\n\nReflecting on his fourth Player of Match award at the tournament, Jacks said, “I reckon this is the best.\n\n“I’m buzzing, to be not out at the end – when it was on a knife-edge when I went out there – I’m over the moon.\n\n“Rehan played amazingly and put them on the backfoot, and I was able to play off him.\n\n“Going into the semifinals, we feel in a strong position with three wins against three very good teams.”\n\nEarlier, New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner won the toss and elected to bat first, knowing a win would earn the Kiwis the second semifinal spot from Group 2.\n\n\n\nNew Zealand, who have never won the T20 World Cup, fielded the same side that beat Sri Lanka comprehensively on Wednesday, while England, who had already qualified after beating Sri Lanka and Pakistan, bolstered its spin attack by recalling Ahmed in place of Jamie Overton.\n\nThe decision may have been questionable when the Kiwis reached 64-0 after 6.5 overs. Ahmed’s wrist-spin partner Adil Rashid stepped in, however, to have Tim Seifert stumped for 35 off 25, before off-spinner Will Jacks removed Finn Allen for 29 off 19.\n\nOver to Ahmed, who picked up the wicket of Rachin Ravindra with his first ball in World Cup cricket. Glenn Phillips topped up the total with 39 off 28 before he became Jacks’ second wicket, while Rashid and Ahmed also went on to claim two scalps.\n\n“We have seen what Rehan can do in the nets, and he has gone out there and taken the game away from them,” England captain Brooks said.\n\n“We said from the start of the competition that we will select players based on conditions, and we felt today was the day to bring Rehan in – he did an amazing job.”\n\nSouth Africa has already qualified from Group 1. The second spot will be decided by the result of the match between India and the West Indies on Sunday. England will face the winner of that game in the semifinals.\n\n“We’ve already played against West Indies … both teams are very strong and powerful,” Brooks added.\n\n“We still haven’t played the perfect game, nor had the starts we would like with the bat and ball, but we have got over the line in some very tight games and in World Cups that can help you.”\n\nFor Pakistan to leapfrog New Zealand and set up a semifinal against South Africa, they must either beat Sri Lanka by roughly 65 runs or more, or chase their target down in fewer than 13 overs. Both equations will be dependent on the outcome of the first innings of the game."

            "content": "The United States must drop its “excessive demands” in nuclear talks with Iran to achieve a successful outcome, the Iranian foreign minister has said, as the US embassy in Jerusalem granted permission to nonemergency staff members to leave Israel amid fears of a regional war.\n\nAbbas Aragchi made the remarks during a phone call with his Egyptian counterpart Badr Abdel Ati, according to a report on Friday by the ISNA news agency.\n\nIran’s top diplomat said that “success on this path requires seriousness and realism on the part of the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”. He did not elaborate on what those demands are.\n\nAragchi’s statement tempered down previous comments where he hailed “progress” at the talks and described the last round of negotiations between Iranian and US officials in Geneva as the “most intense so far”.\n\n“It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal – including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” he said.\n\nFurther negotiations will be conducted in parallel to meetings between technical teams in Vienna in the coming days, the Iranian diplomat added.\n\nAmerican and Iranian officials left the Swiss city following the indirect talks mediated by Oman on Thursday to consult with their respective governments.\n\nSince resuming talks last month, the US has said it wants Iran to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure entirely, limit its arsenal of ballistic missiles and stop supporting regional allies. While Tehran has shown flexibility about discussing limitations on the enrichment of uranium for civilian use, it has so far treated missiles and proxies as non-negotiables.\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump has said he favours a diplomatic resolution to the standoff, but has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran if it does not accept a deal. The US has amassed its biggest military arsenal in the region since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, including the world’s biggest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford, which arrived on Friday in the Israeli port city of Haifa, according to Israeli Channel 12.\n\nIran has said that it was not going to initiate a war, but that it was ready to respond if attacked, threatening to strike bases used by US forces in the region.\n\nThe military build-up has left the region bracing for a potential war that could spiral into a regional conflict. On Friday, China told its citizens to evacuate from Iran “as soon as possible” and the US authorised the departure of nonemergency embassy staff from Israel – the same order Washington issued for the US mission in Lebanon earlier this week. Canada, India, UK and Poland have also issued similar orders."

            "content": "It was a chilly January afternoon in Iowa, and crowds of supporters ringed the stump-speech stage, festooned in red, white and blue.\n\nThe scene could have easily been part of United States President Donald Trump's bid for re-election two years ago.\n\nBut last month, he hit the campaign trail yet again with a different mission: winning the midterm elections for the Republican Party.\n\n\"I'm here because we're starting the campaign to win the midterms,\" Trump told the crowd. \"We've got to win the midterms.\"\n\nIt is not uncommon for sitting presidents to support their party in the midterm races, even though they themselves are not on the ballot. But as the 2026 midterm primaries approach in March, the Trump administration has made it clear one politician should be centre stage: Trump himself.\n\nSources close to the White House have indicated that the president is pursuing an aggressive campaign strategy, one that could include near-weekly public rallies.\n\n\"He's going to campaign like it's 2024 again,\" Susie Wiles, his chief of staff and former campaign manager, told The Mom View talk show in December.\n\nAlready, Trump visited two critical swing states, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, in December, and he has continued to hold public events in the weeks since, touting his economic record in Iowa and Michigan.\n\nBut the strategy comes with risks. Midterms often bring stinging losses for the sitting president's party, and Democrats are hoping to leverage Trump's wilting poll numbers to chip away at the Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress.\n\n\"The Democratic Party most likely will frame this midterm election as a national referendum on President Trump,\" said Liberty University law professor Tory L Lucas.\n\n“The more President Trump plays into that narrative and places himself at the centre of the midterms, the more likely the Republican Party will rise or fall based on his personality and popularity.\""

Why am I being prevented?”\n\nAnother man, Ali Nawas, 58, told the news agency that he and his wife had travelled for more than an hour from Nablus in the occupied West Bank, only for his wife to be turned back at the Qalandiya checkpoint, despite her having a permit.\n\n“I was forced to return with her. How could she go back to Nablus alone?” he said."

The “Video Games for All” sale includes discounts on physical games for most modern consoles, making it a great time to treat yourself (or a pal) to some titles that you’ve been waiting to see big price drops for. There are also deals on gaming accessories like totes, controllers, and more. Through February 27th at 11:58PM CT, you can score an additional 20 percent off products looped into this sale by entering the code LEVEL20 at checkout (it caps at $30 total off your order).\n\nEveryone’s tastes are different, but some picks in this sale that especially vibe with me include Silent Hill F, which is fun and very different beast from Bloober Team’s Silent Hill 2 remake (less item hunting, more countering enemy attacks). Of course, who can argue against the pure fun contained within the Super Mario Galaxy double-pack for Switch that includes the original title and its sequel? It’s always cliché to say that there’s something for everyone here, but I think it’s actually true this time.\n\nMore deals and discounts\n\nGovee’s Pendant Light might just be the ticket.

Despite the low price, they can be mighty impressive. An example of that is the, which are just $19.88 at Amazon Walmart , and Best Buy (originally $34.99) in multiple color schemes. This price has been available for much of this month, but in case the right time to buy for you is now, these offer up to 20 hours of battery life thanks to their lanyard-equipped charging case.

            "content": "is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nIt’s the day of the Pentagon’s looming ultimatum for Anthropic: allow the US military unchecked access to its technology, including for mass surveillance and fully autonomous lethal weapons, or potentially be designated a “supply chain risk” and potentially lose hundreds of billions of dollars in contracts. Amid the intensifying public statements and threats, tech workers across the industry are looking at their own companies’ government and military contracts wondering what kind of future they’re helping to build.\n\nWhile the Department of Defense has spent weeks negotiating with Anthropic over removing its guardrails, including allowing the US military to use Anthropic’s AI kill targets with no human oversight, OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to such terms, although OpenAI is reportedly attempting to adopt the same red lines in the agreements as Anthropic. The overall situation has left employees at some companies with defense contracts feeling betrayed. “When I joined the tech industry, I thought tech was about making people’s lives easier,” an Amazon Web Services employee told The Verge, “but now it seems like it’s all about making it easier to surveil and deport and kill people.”\n\nIn conversations with The Verge, current and former employees from OpenAI, xAI, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google expressed similar feelings about the changing moral landscape of their companies. Organized groups representing 700,000 tech workers at Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and more have signed a letter demanding that the companies reject the Pentagon’s demands. But many saw little chance of their employers — whether they’re directly embroiled in this conflict or not — questioning the government or pushing back.\n\n“From their perspective, they’d love to keep making money and not have to talk about it,” said a software engineer from Microsoft.\n\nSo far, Anthropic has stood its ground. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei put out a statement on Thursday that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” But he has stated that he is not at all opposed to lethal autonomous weapons sometime in the future, just that the technology was not reliable enough “today.” Amodei even offered to partner with the DoD on “R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer,” he wrote in the statement.\n\nIn the past few years, however, major tech companies have loosened their rules or changed their mission statements to expand into lucrative government or military contracts. In 2024, OpenAI removed a ban on “military and warfare” use cases from its terms of service; after that, it signed a deal with autonomous weapons maker Anduril and then its DoD contract, and just this week, Anthropic changed its oft-touted responsible scaling policy, dropping its longtime safety pledge in order to ensure it stayed competitive in the AI race. Big Tech players like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have also allowed defense and intelligence agencies to use their AI products, including some agreeing to work with ICE despite growing outcry from the public and employees alike.\n\nIn past years, tech workers’ resistance to partnerships and deals they deem harmful to society at large sometimes led to big change. In 2018, for instance, thousands of Google employees successfully pressured the company to end its “Project Maven” partnership with the Pentagon, and Microsoft workers presented leadership with an anti-ICE petition signed by about 500 Microsoft employees, though Microsoft still works with the agency. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, tech companies made public statements about and financial commitments supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. But in recent months, the industry has seen a very different reality: a culture of fear and silence, especially amid cooperation with the Trump administration and ICE, tech workers recently told The Verge.\n\nCompanies have followed in the footsteps of longtime surveillance and military tech partnerships, who have only become more hawkish. That includes the Peter Thiel-cofounded Palantir, whose CEO Alex Karp recently stated to shareholders that “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. And we hope you’re in favor of that.” (Protect Democracy, a nonprofit, recently put out an open letter calling for Congressional oversight of the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted use of AI. )\n\nOpenAI, Google, Microsoft, xAI, and Amazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nA former xAI employee told The Verge, “Everyone is actually working on killer robots at this point,” adding that he believes everyone will follow in the footsteps of Palantir, Anduril, and xAI, since the government sentiment is that if a company doesn’t acquiesce, it’s “against the benefits of the country, in a sense.” He said there’s a “big push for working with the military, and the trend is it’s cool to do it… You’re a patriot if you do it.”\n\nA Google employee called the situation a “dominance display from Hegseth that is disgusting.” He added, “Over and over AI is presenting us with choices about who we want to be and what kind of society and future we want to have. And they’re coming at us fast and with, really, the least thoughtful and least principled leaders in power that we could imagine. I can only thank Anthropic for insisting on the decent path and using their leverage — that they are indispensable — to chart a course toward a humane world and a humane future.”\n\nThe AWS employee told The Verge that “boundaries have definitely eroded in terms of the customers big tech is willing to court” and that there’s “a deliberate whitewashing of the implications of new lucrative deals.” She recalled recently receiving an email from an AWS executive touting a more than $580 million contract with the US Air Force, among other partnerships, as a sign of Amazon’s AI successes, with no acknowledgment of the broader scope or harms involved.\n\n“If the government is hell-bent on pursuing technologies like this, they should have to build them themselves, and be answerable for those decisions,” she said.\n\nThe erosion may have extended to internal culture as well — normalizing the idea that companies should always be watching. The AWS employee said that she and her colleagues are tracked on how much they’re using AI for their jobs, how often they’re working from the office, and more. “I can see myself and my coworkers getting more desensitized to surveillance on ourselves at work, and I’m worried that means we’re obeying, complying, and giving up too much in advance,” she said.\n\nAn OpenAI employee said the general feeling within the AI industry over the last few weeks “has reopened the door to more discussion… about the values and the future of the technology.” The employee said that the Pentagon-Anthropic situation, the recent ICE headlines, and the fast advancement of AI have been some of the main factors opening up those discussions internally.\n\nEven so, people who are immigrants or in more vulnerable positions are more afraid to speak, the OpenAI employee said.\n\nAnthropic, the former xAI employee said, seems like it’s in a position where it can say no and still stay afloat. Its focus on enterprise rather than consumer AI business may make it more sustainable even without government contracts, offering it some leverage. A software engineer at Microsoft said of Anthropic, speaking generally, “I was surprised to see them stand on some form of principle. I don’t know how long it’ll last.”\n\n“Will it last?” seems to be the question on everyone’s lips. The Pentagon has already reportedly asked two major defense contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, to provide information about their reliance on Anthropic’s Claude, as it moves to potentially designate Anthropic a “supply chain risk,” a classification usually reserved for threats to national security and rarely, if ever, assigned to a US company. It also reportedly may be considering invoking the Defense Production Act to attempt to force Anthropic to comply with its request.\n\nJust like with any other AI company, if Anthropic folds, the Microsoft employee said, there’s little chance of it or others pulling back on killer robots and surveillance. “Once you’re in the door with the Department of Defense or whatever we’re calling it now… I think it’s probably hard for them to actually have the oversight they claim. It’s just going to be lucrative to basically give themselves permission to do the thing that makes the most money.”\n\nIn Microsoft’s own case, he said he doesn’t expect the company to adhere to any sort of ethical principles. The company has worked extensively with the Israeli Defense Forces, including for mass surveillance of Palestinians and dissidents, despite employee protest. (It said it ended some parts of the partnership last year.)\n\nAnother Microsoft employee told The Verge that although “Microsoft holds a Responsible AI ‘commitment,’… they are currently attempting to play both sides for the sake of profit rather than meaningfully commitment to Responsible AI.”\n\nBut this is nothing new, one AI startup employee said. In her eyes, the boundaries have often been “fuzzy, especially within AI,” about what kinds of things companies are willing to let their technology power. “A lot of it has been going on beneath the surface for as long as AI has been around.”\n\nThe AWS employee emphasized that “we need cross-tech solidarity and a coherent, worker-led vision for AI now more than ever.”\n\n“The safeguards that Anthropic is trying to keep in place are no mass surveillance of Americans and no fully autonomous weapons, which just means that they want a human in the loop if the machine is going to kill somebody,” she added. “Even if this technology were perfect — which it isn’t — I think most Americans don’t want machines that kill people without human oversight running around in an America that’s become an AI-powered mass surveillance state.”"

The Thursday incident reportedly led the Federal Aviation Administration to close the airspace where the military fired the anti-drone laser.\n\nThis marks the second time this month that officials closed airspace near the US-Mexico border due to an incident involving an anti-drone laser. On February 11th, officials closed airspace around the El Paso International Airport for hours after CBP fired an anti-drone laser without coordinating with the FAA, The New York Times reported at the time. Though Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement that the FAA and Department of War moved to “address a cartel drone incursion,” it reportedly turned out to be a party balloon.\n\nNow, the FAA, CBP, and the Pentagon tell Reuters that the military “employed counter-unmanned aircraft system authorities to mitigate a seemingly threatening unmanned aerial system operating within military airspace,” adding that the incident “took place far away from populated areas and there were no commercial aircraft in the vicinity.” This most recent incident reportedly led to a smaller airspace closure and was also done without approval from the FAA, the Times reports.\n\nIn a joint statement, Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), André Carson (D-IN), and Rick Larsen (D-WA) — the top Democrats on committees overseeing homeland security, aviation, and transportation — expressed outrage over the incident. “We said MONTHS ago that the White House’s decision to sidestep a bipartisan, tri-committee bill to appropriately train C-UAS [Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems] operators and address the lack of coordination between the Pentagon, DHS and the FAA was a short-sighted idea,” the statement says. “Now, we’re seeing the result of its incompetence.”"

It’s a single image but a notable one showing protagonist Kratos and his son Atreus. The characters are played by Ryan Hurst and Callum Vinson, respectively, and they look relatively close to their video game counterparts.\n\nThere aren’t a lot of other details about the show just yet, but this is Amazon’s official description:\n\nThe God of War series storyline follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human.\n\nThat sounds a lot like the recent soft reboot of the franchise, which started with 2018’s God of War and continued through Ragnarök in 2022. For the Amazon series, Ronald D. Moore, best-known for his work on For All Mankind and Battlestar Galactica, will serve as showrunner. The rest of the cast includes: Mandy Patinkin (Odin), Ed Skrein (Baldur), Max Parker (Heimdall), Ólafur Darri Ólafsson (Thor), Teresa Palmer (Sif), Alastair Duncan (Mimir), Jeff Gulka (Sindri), and Danny Woodburn (Brok).\n\nWhile production is underway on the God of War series, there’s no word on when it might start streaming.\n\nWhile Amazon appears to be stepping back from making games, it’s been pushing hard on adaptations for Prime Video. In addition to God of War, there’s Fallout, which just wrapped up season 2, and an upcoming Tomb Raider show starring Sophie Turner."

The S26 lines come with some useful new things — particularly the Privacy Display on the S26 Ultra, which looks like an extremely cool bit of tech and a really useful new feature — and a lot of iterative year-over-year changes.

You can sign up here.\n\nOn this episode of The Vergecast, Nilay and David discuss the new phones, then dive into the ways in which the S26’s AI camera features seem to be clearly designed to change the whole idea of what happens when you try to take a picture. For that matter, it’s not even clear that what you’re taking is a “picture” anymore. We’ve been talking about the “What is a photo?” apocalypse for some time, and the S26 feels like a crossing of a line. All in the service of some cupcakes.\n\nAfter that, the hosts turn to the big shakeup inside the Xbox team. With Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond out, and Asha Sharma in, it’s time to wonder what happened to the Xbox, and whether Sharma or anyone can fix it. Microsoft’s gaming problems have been around for years and are the result of a string of bad bets and bad decisions.

Nintendo also shared a trailer showcasing a new trio of starter pokémon — Browt, Pombon, and Gecua — and a number of different environments you’ll be able to explore as you play through the games.\n\nIn addition to establishing that Winds and Waves takes place in an island setting, the trailer really highlights how much more detailed and complex the games’ environments are compared to past titles like Scarlet / Violet and Legends: Z-A. It seems like you’ll be able to explore dense jungles, caves full of magma, and beneath the ocean all while encountering wild pokémon. In a press release, Nintendo said that Winds and Waves will be open-world games, and the company also noted that Brazilian Portuguese will officially be supported as a selectable language.\n\n2027 is still a ways out from now, but Winds and Waves definitely seems like it’s going to be worth the wait. And with Pokopia about to drop next week, there’s going to be plenty to keep Pokémon fans busy in the meantime."

            "content": "This is Optimizer, a weekly newsletter sent every Friday from Verge senior reviewer Victoria Song that dissects and discusses the latest gizmos and potions that swear they’re going to change your life. Opt in for Optimizer here.\n\nIn 2017, I was at rock bottom. My dad’s health was rapidly failing; my relationship with my mom was on the rocks. I was in a not-so-great place in my career. My undiagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome was wreaking havoc on my health. I was already in a dark place when a situationship broke my heart, my roommate notified me they were moving out, and I received a surprise $5,000 vet bill for my dog. Stressed, depressed, and a hot mess, I stopped eating.\n\nPhysically, I wanted to eat. Mentally, I simply couldn’t. A week into my involuntary fast, my therapist suggested meal replacement drinks until we could work out a solution. For six weeks, I forced myself to drink two chocolate Ensures a day until I managed to start piecing my life back together. It was a miserable, terrifying time, in which I lost 20 percent of my body weight.\n\nI was recently transported back to that time thanks to a Huel ad. If you’re unaware, Huel is a wellness brand that sells meal replacement drinks, powders, supplements, instant meals, and daily greens. It’s probably best known for its powders and ready-made shakes, but this particular ad is for its daily greens drink. A manicured hand snaps open a can as wistful violins play over a series of text: Just went through a breakup. Is getting married next month. Just lost their job. Just need a break from the world. Looking for community. Just got a promotion. Just surviving the day. The caption reads, “No matter the moment, Daily Greens are ready to drink,” punctuated by a green heart emoji.\n\nIt just so happens that when I took a look at AG1’s science-washed marketing in a recent Optimizer, several readers requested I do the same for Huel. The two products are similar. Both aim to make up for a perceived lack of nutrients in an ordinary person’s diet. Both employ fit celebrities and influencers as spokespersons. AG1 has Hugh Jackman and Andrew Huberman, while Huel’s site boasts actor Idris Elba, former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, and Steven Bartlett from the Diary of a CEO podcast. Whereas AG1 leaned on dubious terms like “clinically backed,” Huel uses framing like “nutritionally complete” and “scientifically supported.” And while AG1 is clearly a greens supplement, Huel lives in a grayer area between greens supplements, protein powders, meal replacement, and ready-made food. Buzzy phrases like “nutrient-dense,” “superfoods,” “plant-based,” and “sustainable” also make appearances.\n\nPerusing Huel’s marketing, the meal replacement narrative is what sticks out the most. “Huel is an ally on my busiest days,” reads Bartlett’s testimonial. “I always have a couple in the fridge at home — it’s my go-to when I realize I haven’t eaten,” reads another from Premier League Hall of Famer Gary Neville. Other ideas that frequently pop up: no prep, no need to buy food, cost efficiency, and staying healthy while on the go. It’s the solution “for your most inconvenient meal,” and “everything your body needs.”\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen a tech- and wellness-adjacent meal replacement pitch. Remember Soylent? But the science behind meal replacement is more complicated than just packing nutrients into a bottle.\n\nFor starters, meal replacement supplements are not meant to replace food entirely. Even if a shake contains all the essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins, supplemental forms aren’t necessarily the same as what you’d get from eating whole foods. According to Stanford Medicine, absorption is generally better when those same micronutrients come from foods. Heat processing for shelf stability can also reduce potency. Since supplements aren’t regulated, evaluating sourcing, purity, and dosage can be hard without independent testing. (Huel does provide quality control information on its site, and says it’s received NSF International certification for its Black Edition product.)\n\nWhat does ‘nutritionally complete’ actually mean?\n\nTake the Black Edition of its ready-made drink: Huel says you get 7g of fiber from flaxseed, chicory, and corn. That sounds great on the surface. Most people don’t get the daily recommended 25 to 38g of fiber, 7g is high for this kind of product, and Huel includes both soluble and insoluble forms. But scientists have found that not all dietary fiber supplements are created equal. Chicory root fiber, or inulin, is often controversial as, in some people, it can cause gastrointestinal distress, inflammation, and potentially liver damage if taken in excess. In a diverse diet, you’d be getting even more forms of soluble and insoluble fiber, so some inulin might not be a problem. But if you’re prone to gas, bloating, or have irritable bowel syndrome? Heavily relying on Huel’s limited fiber sources might not be your best option.\n\nIn 2022, Huel commissioned a peer-reviewed study in Frontiers in Nutrition. In it, Huel recruited 20 participants to subsist on Huel — and only Huel — for four weeks. Good news: They didn’t die. Some micronutrient levels improved, compared to one monitored week of eating regularly. Other micronutrient levels didn’t improve. Many lost weight, reduced their BMI and waist circumference, and lost visceral fat (the bad kind).\n\nThe thing is, the study’s primary conclusion is that subsisting for four weeks on Huel won’t negatively impact your micronutrient levels. The study’s researchers also note that the weight loss and reduced BMI, waist circumference, and visceral fat were likely due to the fact that the participants consistently could not meet calorie requirements while on a Huel-only diet. It’s less that Huel was “healthy” than participants found it hard to eat a lot of Huel, and were thus in a prolonged calorie deficit.\n\nOn its site, Huel caveats that it doesn’t advocate only eating its product, but says this study “pretty conclusively” shows its product is “healthy.” But a single study in a clinical setting — which doesn’t reflect real-life use — and a limited sample size is far from conclusive. In 2024, a meta-analysis in Nutrients of 6,770 adults found that “daily and weekly [meal replacement] consumption were associated with higher risks of all-cause mortality.”\n\nI bought Huel’s ready-to-drink Black Edition in chocolate for research. It cost me roughly $18 at Target for a box of four bottles. I’ve been sipping one over the course of writing this newsletter and I cannot lie: I am on the struggle bus. After two hours of writing and researching, I still have over a quarter of the 500ml bottle left.\n\nIt tastes a bit like wet chalk. After it slithers down my gullet, there’s a distinct aftertaste in my mouth that reminds me of my time drinking chocolate Ensure. Taste is subjective, but I’m inclined to believe that the pants of Huel’s wellness influencer partners are aflame. On that marketing front, I give Huel a D.\n\nIn other areas, however, Huel is far from the worst wellness brand I’ve seen. Its study was a little silly and I don’t love that it’s framed as “conclusive.” However, on its website summarizing the study, it does disclose some of the study’s drawbacks and flaws. (It does so with a slightly positive spin, but I’ll take that information over artfully omitting it entirely.)\n\nIt has science pages for each of its individual products, which give a breakdown of each ingredient included, the reasoning behind including it, and reference links to outside studies supporting those decisions. For example, on the science site for its Black Edition powder, it breaks down why it chose peas and brown rice for protein. It explains it chose two sources because plant protein doesn’t always include all nine essential amino acids required from your diet. When it claims protein is more satiating than other macronutrients, it cites this study. Most people will not click each link, and I only had the patience to click through roughly 20 percent. Some were relatively old but well cited; others were less convincing. But, compared to other wellness brands I’ve reviewed, I appreciated that the studies were clearly labeled as references and not as Huel’s own research.\n\nCooking isn’t always fun, but it took me five hours to choke down this ‘ultimate meal in a bottle.’\n\nHuel’s biggest fault is perhaps playing fast and loose with phrasing like “nutritionally complete” and videos that suggest this is a much more convenient alternative to cooking — and that that convenience is a good thing. (Never mind that most dieticians will tell you whole food sources of nutrients are better for you.) Like Soylent, that plays into tech-adjacent productivity narratives, where somehow taking the time and effort to eat a well-balanced meal is a burden. Subtly placing that next to claims of “sustainable” “plant-based food,” and a convincing “$2.65 per meal” badge for its powder? It’s not a huge jump for someone to think, “Wow, I can be healthy, not have to cook, save money, and eat something that’s not too bad for the planet?”\n\nHuel has gotten into hot water for misleading advertising. Remember how I mentioned podcaster Steven Bartlett’s glowing testimonial earlier? Multiple ads were banned by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority because he failed to disclose that, at the time, he was a director and investor at Huel. The ASA also banned Huel ads claiming that using it as a healthy meal replacement could lead to lower food bills. Huel claimed a month’s worth was only £50. The agency found that was only true if you ate Huel once a day, and the true cost was £350.\n\nThere are some truths baked into Huel’s marketing. Meal prepping does suck. Sometimes you are too busy, and grabbing a bottle of Huel — as blah as it is — is likely cheaper, and potentially more nutrient dense, than junk food. Sometimes, meal replacement or supplementation is appropriate — especially in cases where you might not be able to eat solid food, like after a surgery or while managing a chronic illness.\n\nTake it from me, someone who did need meal replacement as an intervention at one point in my life. At no point did that process bring relief or joy. I was far from my optimal self. While I did get complimented for my dramatic weight loss, I was physically so weak that I barely had enough energy to crawl out of bed, let alone work a demanding job. Whatever savings I had from not buying food, it wasn’t worth it. At the end of the day, something like Huel is best thought of as a temporary, occasional “lesser of two evils.” That’s not the same thing as healthy.\n\nPhotography by Victoria Song / The Verge"

            "content": "In Brief\n\nSuno co-founder and CEO Mikey Shulman shared on LinkedIn that the AI music generator has amassed 2 million paid subscribers and $300 million in annual recurring revenue.\n\nJust three months ago, Suno announced a $250 million funding round that valued the company at $2.45 billion. At the time, Suno told The Wall Street Journal that annual revenue had hit $200 million — that would indicate that the company has had some major growth in a short time frame.\n\nSuno lets users create music using natural language prompts, making it possible for people with little experience to generate audio with little effort. This has sparked concern from musicians and record labels, who have sued Suno for copyright infringement, since its AI model was likely trained on existing recorded music. But Warner Music Group recently settled its lawsuit and instead reached a deal that allows Suno to launch models that use licensed music from its catalog.\n\nSuno has generated synthetic music that sounds real enough to top charts on Spotify and Billboard. Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her poetry into the viral R&B song “How Was I Supposed to Know” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth $3 million.\n\nStill, many musicians have spoken out against the use of AI in music, including Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, Katy Perry, and more."

It runs entirely in the cloud, which might spare it some of the security concerns of other agentic tools like OpenClaw.\n\nTechCrunch hasn’t done a hands-on demo of the new tool, but in example workflows on Perplexity’s website, it is shown handling tasks that involve collecting statistics, financial or legal data, creating analysis, and sharing its findings as finished websites or visualizations.\n\nPerplexity executives invited the press to a background briefing with executives last week to discuss the product and lay out the agenda for the year. The event was intended to include a demonstration of the tool, but the company cancelled the demo because of flaws found in the product hours before the event.\n\nThis tool represents the evolution of Perplexity, which made a splash early in the AI boom by wrapping frontier models in familiar user interfaces, particularly its search-engine-like answer service. It then moved on to launch its Comet web browser last summer. Competitors like Google have now changed their products to be more like those built at Perplexity, one executive said, but that’s a threat as much as a compliment.\n\nThe company is changing in response to a shifting ecosystem: One of the first AI companies to offer advertising, it abandoned that business late last year, saying last week that it undermined users’ trust in their answers’ accuracy. But Perplexity’s total user base—in the tens of millions of users—pales in comparison to that of OpenAI, which claims 800 million weekly users and began testing ads in ChatGPT this year.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nNow, Perplexity executives say they are aiming for a more boutique set of users, with products that serve people making “GDP-moving decisions.” Executives in the briefing, who asked not to be identified by name, described prioritizing enterprise subscriptions, particularly for deep research.\n\n“You don’t hear us talk about MAUs ever, because we’re not actually on a mission to get as many users as possible,” one executive said.\n\nPerplexity recently released a new benchmark for complex research tasks, called Draco, where (no surprise) its own deep research offering beats out competitors like Gemini.\n\nPerplexity says it is no longer reliant on other companies’ APIs for its web index and now has its own AI-optimized search API. But the company is doubling down on packaging frontier models in a consumer-friendly user experience, arguing that there is value in orchestrating multiple third-party LLMs to obtain the most cost-effective and accurate answers to queries.\n\n“Multi-model is the future,” one Perplexity exec argued. Models, in their view, are specializing, not commoditizing. The company has found that its users frequently switch between models to obtain the results they are looking for, with December 2025 queries for visual outputs most often sent to Gemini Flash, software engineering done by Claude Sonnet 4.5, and medical research in GPT-5.1.\n\nA visualization of model usage by Perplexity users over time. Image Credits:Perplexity\n\nIf one LLM is better at coding tasks and another does a better job drafting marketing copy, Perplexity’s software can automatically choose the ideal one. Another example, executives said, is running Perplexity’s own modified open-source Chinese-built LLMs to answer queries more cheaply, a technique the company got dinged for hiding from its customers last year. But done transparently, the technique could prove an efficient way to optimize LLM queries.\n\nThe company also offers users the opportunity to query multiple models at once, in a feature called Model Council. But the unit economics of offering multiple queries at flat subscription rates aren’t entirely clear.\n\nStill, without expensive infrastructure projects on its books and with, the executives claimed, high margins on users fees, Perplexity believes it will remain competitive by allocating tokens to the best model for a purpose.\n\nAnd there is more coming: Perplexity Comet browser is coming to iOS next month, and the company is planning a developers’ conference, Ask, on March 11 in San Francisco to promote third-party use of its API.\n\nOne executive said that instead of looking at the previous day’s number of queries each morning, he was now looking at the most recent revenue metrics. At least some customers are noticing a new focus on the bottom line, with the Perplexity subreddit featuring frequent complaints of new rate limits on free and subscription product tiers.\n\nHowever, the execs at the briefing dismisses such complaints. “Any discussions on the free tier being made worse or rate-limited is completely false,” an executive said."

Fans have also honed in on a suspicious-looking cloud in the trailer, which looks like a Gyarados-slash-Lapras flying through the sky — perhaps it’s a nod to a new legendary Pokémon?\n\nPokémon already explored a tropical island vibe in the Hawaii-inspired “Sun and Moon” games, which came out nearly ten years ago, but there’s still a ton to explore in that sort of setting, especially now that the franchise is embracing open-world maps. Not all tropical archipelagos are alike!\n\nMain series Pokémon games usually get released in November, which would mean that we have almost two years to wait before we can explore this new region… but hopefully we’ll be surprised. It already seems like forever ago since “Pokémon Scarlet and Violet” came out in 2022. But when that game came out, fans criticized it for feeling rushed and rife with glitches. So if a later release date means we’ll get something incredible, I’m happy to wait.\n\nIn the meantime, Pokémon fans can buy reissues of the “Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen” games today for the Switch… but they cost $20. It’s too bad that there isn’t an extremely easy and legally dubious way to get those games on your phone for free."

The open letter’s signatories seek to encourage their employers to “put aside their differences and stand together” to uphold the boundaries Anthropic has asserted.\n\n“They’re trying to divide each company with fear that the other will give in,” the letter says. “That strategy only works if none of us know where the others stand.”\n\nThe letter specifically calls on executives at Google and OpenAI to maintain Anthropic’s red lines against mass surveillance and fully automated weaponry. “We hope our leaders will put aside their differences and stand together to continue to refuse the Department of War’s current demands.”\n\nLeaders at the companies have not yet formally reponded to the letter. TechCrunch has reached out to Google and OpenAI for comment.\n\nHowever, informal statements suggest both companies are sympathetic to Anthropic’s side of the case. In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that he doesn’t “personally think the Pentagon should be threatening DPA against these companies.” According to a CNN reporter, an OpenAI spokesperson confirmed that the company shares Anthropic’s red lines against autonomous weapons and mass surveillance.\n\nAgreed.

Now the agency has replaced its top acting leader, a CISA spokesperson tells TechCrunch.\n\nThe move to replace Madhu Gottumukkala as the acting director of CISA, an agency under the Department of Homeland Security that oversees cybersecurity and technical protection across the federal government, comes after a tumultuous year serving as the agency’s top boss.\n\nGottumukkala struggled to lead the agency during his tenure as acting director and caused security headaches, including the uploading of sensitive government documents to ChatGPT, according to reports. Staffing at the agency was slashed by one-third. Gottumukkala also reportedly failed a counterintelligence polygraph he took in order to view classified documents, and suspended several career officials in response, including the agency’s then-chief security officer.\n\nBefore being nominated to CISA as deputy director, Gottumukkala was chief technology officer of South Dakota under then-governor and current Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem.\n\nABC News was first to report Gottumukkala’s departure.\n\nIn a statement shared with TechCrunch on Friday, CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy claimed Gottumukkala had done a “remarkable job.” McCarthy told TechCrunch that Nick Andersen will replace Gottumukkala as CISA’s new acting director, and that Gottumukkala has been moved to a new position as director of strategic implementation in the Department of Homeland Security, which houses CISA.\n\nPrior to his appointment as acting director to lead CISA, Andersen served as the agency’s top official overseeing its cybersecurity division.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Ron Wyden last year blocked Plankey’s nomination until the agency agreed to release an unclassified report allegedly describing cybersecurity flaws at phone and telecommunication giants. Wyden demanded the report’s release in the wake of hundreds of hacks targeting U.S. and international phone and internet providers by the China-backed hacking group known as Salt Typhoon. The Senate has yet to schedule Plankey’s nomination hearing.\n\nNextgov reported Thursday that CISA lost another top senior official, Bob Costello, the agency’s chief information officer tasked with overseeing the agency’s IT systems and data policies. The news outlet reported Gottumukkala tried to transfer Costello but was blocked by unnamed political appointees.\n\nCISA’s spokesperson McCarthy did not address Costello’s departure when asked by TechCrunch, but did not dispute the report."

Similar to the streaming giant’s Music and Podcast Charts, the Audiobook Charts will be updated weekly and highlight the top audiobooks overall and by genre. These rankings are based on listening behavior and engagement on the streaming service, the company says.\n\nThe new charts are accessible to both free and paying users within the audiobooks hub. You can find them by tapping the search button in the app and selecting the “Audiobooks” tile to enter the hub. Then, you need to scroll down to the “Dive deeper” section to find the charts.\n\nThe move marks Spotify’s latest investment in the audiobooks space, following its official support of the format in 2022.\n\nSince then, Spotify has continued investing in audiobooks with additional features like the recently launched “Page Match” tool, which lets users scan a page from a physical book to instantly transition to that spot in the audiobook, and “Audiobook Recaps,” which are short audio summaries to catch you up on what you’ve already read so far.\n\nSpotify says the new Audiobook Charts will benefit both readers and authors by giving listeners a trusted way to discover popular titles, while also creating new opportunities for authors and the publishing industry to reach wider audiences.\n\n“As we’ve proven with Music and Podcasts Charts, when content is easier to access, discover, and enjoy, the demand grows,” said Duncan Bruce, Spotify’s director of Audiobook Partnerships and Licensing, in the blog post. “We are delighted to now bring that to audiobooks, to help provide even more ways for users, publishers, and authors to discover what’s trending on Spotify, and make books more connected with culture in real time.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that Spotify isn’t only interested in audiobooks, as the streaming giant also recently ventured into physical book sales. Spotify announced earlier this month that users in the U.S. and the U.K. will soon be able to purchase physical copies of books directly within the app through a partnership with Bookshop.org."

            "content": "Before last week the name Alap Shah didn’t ring a bell for many people. The 45-year-old financial analyst and tech entrepreneur had spent the past two decades working in relative obscurity. Then last weekend he coauthored a blog with the research firm Citrini titled “The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis.” It was a “thought exercise” about the impacts of artificial intelligence, and it predicted that in June of that year, AI would jack up unemployment past 10 percent and force the Dow down, down, down. Writing in a confident, Nostradamic tone—as if auditioning for starring roles in the next Michael Lewis book—the authors painted a picture of a flywheel in reverse: AI agents take jobs from workers, people spend less, and struggling corporations conduct layoffs on top of layoffs.\n\nThere wasn’t much in it that hadn’t been previously heard, or speculated about. Tech leaders like Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei have already estimated that half the entry level white collar jobs will soon be gone, and earlier this year, Anthropic’s release of new agentic tools spurred a Wall Street selloff. Nonetheless the report hit with the force of the blizzard blowing through lower Manhattan. When the closing chimes sounded on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was down 800 points. The name Alap Shah was now ringing bells.\n\nThe achievement is less impressive than it seems. Wall Street, like the rest of us, is in a persistent state of anxiety about AI, and it doesn’t take much to trigger a mini-panic. Financial markets don’t necessarily map to reality, but the jitters reflect a wider disquiet. The AI future is in a William Gibson zone—it’s here, but unevenly distributed—and the news from those already living in the agent-packed, AI code-writing universe is both exciting and unsettling. Emphasis on unsettling.\n\nNo one—no one!—knows exactly how AI will impact the economy, but clearly it will be significant. Right now stocks are soaring, so it seems to make sense to keep the party going. But then along comes the latest doom manifesto, or a paper indicating that a traditional business sector might be threatened by AI, and suddenly money managers are reminded that the biggest issue of our time is totally unresolved. Case in point: earlier this month, a tiny company (valuation under $6 million) that had previously sold karaoke machines pivoted to AI-powered shipping logistics and put out a report saying that it had discovered some efficiencies in loading semi-trucks. That was enough to erase billions of dollars from the share prices of several major logistics companies, none of which had karaoke experience.\n\nAfter it did its job on Wall Street, the Citrini report came under considerable fire. Critics climbed over each other to proclaim its flimsiness. For one thing, they pointed out, AI has had very little discernable impact on the economy so far. Others cited the long history of resilience after technological upheavals. A mocking response by the respected trading firm Citadel Securities read, “For AI to produce a sustained negative demand shock, the economy must see a material acceleration in adoption, experience near-total labor substitution, no fiscal response, negligible investment absorption, and unconstrained scaling of compute.”\n\nThe most withering critiques disputed the report’s contention that much of the economy involves non-productive “rent-seeking” by middlemen and market makers, taking advantage of the laziness of the general population. When everyone has a few dozen AI agents working on their behalf, writes Shah, consumers will be able to effortlessly find the best goods for the best prices. Apps will be rendered unnecessary—just type what you want into the LLM and an army of agents will do everything for you. The “poster child” for this phenomenon, Shah says, is DoorDash. Instead of being limited to the restaurants on the app, consumers will send out AI agents to find their ideal meal options, contracting directly with restaurants and delivery people—no apps needed. Zero friction! The DoorDashes of the world are avocado toast!"

            "content": "Belt-drive bikes offer some huge upsides. First, they usually require less maintenance, with many belts often lasting twice as long as a typical chain. Second, there’s no grease to speak of, and therefore, no black smudges on your work pants. Third, in the case of the Soltera 3, the belt comes from the Gates brand, whose drivetrain belts are as good as it gets. Belt-drive bikes are silent and often smoother than their chain-driven counterparts.\n\nThat said, the inclusion of a low-maintenance element such as a belt drive paired with hydraulic disc brakes, which require bleeding roughly every year, struck me as an odd choice. If Aventon wanted to make the Soltera 3 as hands-off as possible, cable-actuated brakes would have been a more intuitive choice.\n\nThe other thing that immediately jumps out about the Soltera 3 is its relatively light weight. At 37 pounds, the Soltera 3 is heavy for an analog bike. But it’s certainly not heavy for an ebike, and it’s nearly as stiff, nimble, and navigable as a conventional bicycle. One issue I’ve always had with ebikes is their heft. Given that they’re often made to replace a car, they’re built with load bearing in mind. Also, ebike batteries are heavy.\n\nAdding to that sense of “this is just like my other bikes,” the Soltera 3 simply looks cool, which is often not the case when it comes to ebikes. The matte black my tester bike arrived in looks cool because matte black almost never doesn’t look cool. (Additionally, the Soltera 3 is available in dark matte blue and a sleek silver.) But beyond the finish, the bike’s geometry; its wide, almost perfectly flat handlebars; and its narrow (by ebike standards) 700 x 36 tires make it feel closer in DNA to a road bike than a traditional ebike.\n\nButton Press\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nI’m 6′4′′, and the extra large Soltera 3 that I tested was at a maximum saddle height. It was suitable for me, but I couldn’t recommend anyone bigger than me riding the Soltera 3. That said, with four sizes ranging from small to extra large, the line covers a wide swath of riders, ranging from my height all the way down to 5′ tall."

There's even a notable AI app available for podcasts too. It’s called Huxe.\n\nAt the core of Huxe is a daily brief, a sort of personal productivity podcast tailored to your tastes and requirements, generated from the sources you pick. Connect up your calendar and email account, and every morning you get a quick audio summary to get you set for the day. The idea is that a 15-minute audio podcast can replace the much longer amount of time you'd otherwise spend trying to figure out what's happening with your inbox and your schedule.\n\nThe audio emphasis of Huxe is no surprise, as the team behind the app previously worked on Google NotebookLM, a research tool that has its own podcast-style Audio Overviews feature. Huxe is similar, but it draws information from your emails and calendar entries.\n\nThere's more to Huxe as well, including audio deep dives on any topic of your choice, as well as news summaries. The app is completely free to use right now, and you can sign up through the apps for Android or iOS.\n\nGetting Started\n\nRegistering interests with Huxe. Photograph: David Nield\n\nTo start taking advantage of Huxe’s personalized audio production powers, you need to tell it a little bit about yourself. As you work through the setup process, which includes supplying an email address and your name, you'll be prompted to connect your email and calendar accounts. (Google and Outlook accounts are both supported.)\n\nYou'll also be asked to choose a few topics that you're interested in from a list, generated by what's in your inbox and on your schedule—click Edit to make changes, and Add to add interests that Huxe hasn't picked up on yet. You can specify pretty much any topic you like, and Huxe will understand what you mean.\n\nWhen you get into the app proper, you are introduced to what are called livecasts, which are like radio stations for AI-generated speech content: For me, these livecasts have titles such as Big Tech Roundup, Today in AI, and Product Drops, which gives you some idea of what to expect. You can also get audio summaries about specific companies, such as Apple and Meta in my case."

            "content": "Like the Omron Evolv ($75), the blood pressure cuff has the electronics embedded in the cuff itself. That can make it a little awkward to use, especially if you don’t have a particularly big arm. Aktiia also instructs you to use the cuff on the opposite arm from which you’re wearing the band. You also can’t use third-party BPMs to calibrate the cuff, to ensure Aktiia’s touted accuracy. (The Hilo was FDA-cleared in 2025, has been tested and reviewed in multiple clinical-grade studies over several years, and meets the ISO 81060-2 standard for validating the accuracy of blood pressure monitors.)\n\nA regular BPM cuff measures your blood pressure, or how hard the blood presses against your vessel walls, by inflating the cuff to temporarily stop blood flow. Your doctor, or nowadays a digital oscillometric detector, then listens for when the blood stops and starts flowing in your veins; the highest measurement is your systolic BP, and the lowest your diastolic.\n\nInstead of applying pressure to your blood vessels, the Hilo band uses the same photoplethysmography (PPG) optical sensors that are already in most fitness trackers to analyze the pulse shape of the arteries under your skin. It then uses its proprietary algorithm to measure your blood pressure multiple times a day when you're at rest.\n\nNighttime Measurements\n\nScreenshot Hilo via Adrienne So\n\nContinuous blood pressure monitoring, especially while walking, sleeping, or lying down, is the gold standard for assessing your cardiovascular health. If your blood pressure doesn’t go down while you’re sleeping, that’s a strong indicator that you might have cardiovascular disease. Unfortunately, it’s really hard to relax if something is repeatedly squeezing your arm while you’re trying to sleep.\n\nIf you don’t already know you have hypertension, it’s just not a thing that many of us might think to check. I have excellent blood pressure whenever I go into a doctor’s office, so why would I ask if I can take my blood pressure lying down or overnight?\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo is extremely helpful because I can see my blood pressure dropping while I sleep. It also takes the average of your BP measurements throughout the day, rather than spot-checking at intervals. Some people, like my husband, have low blood pressure no matter what they do. Mine can spike if I read the wrong email, if I’m slightly dehydrated, or if my ankles are crossed when I’m measuring it.\n\nI cross-tested this with the Withings BPM Vision and found that the results tallied; still, it’s nice to be able to measure without taking 30 minutes out of your day to sit and prepare.\n\nNow that the Apple Watch has improved its battery life and you can wear it for 24 hours a day, it can also monitor your blood pressure at night. (The new Whoop band also purports to offer hypertension notifications, but it is notable that the Whoop has not attempted to clear the feature with the FDA.) But the Apple Watch can only look for patterns over a period of 30 days. It doesn’t offer consistent systolic and diastolic readings that your doctor can check."

            "content": "When Netflix dropped the first season of Love Is Blind in February 2020, it offered a reprieve from the washboard abs that normally seem like a casting requirement for reality TV shows.\n\nThe premise—that couples get engaged “sight unseen” after talking to each other through pods, then, following a big reveal, decide if they want to get married—featured just the right amount of mess. Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success.\n\nWhile race still comes up, it’s often in a superficial and offensive way. Contestants either find themselves struggling with the fact that their match is a person of color, or dealing with unaddressed internalized racism that downplays their own worth while prioritizing whiteness in a partner—a worthwhile topic that deserves far more nuance or a therapist’s involvement.\n\nBroadly, Love Is Blind seems to be pushing conservative ideals—trad wives, divorce shaming, and big families even when contestants clearly aren’t enthusiastic about the idea of having kids.\n\nKinetic Content, which produces Love Is Blind, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen 28-year-old Emma Betsinger of the current Ohio season discusses the scars on her arms—a result of surgeries due to her birthmarks—with podmate Steven Sunday, a 32-year-old who works in finance, he grills her about how she lost her virginity instead of asking thoughtful questions. Betsinger’s health issues have made her hesitant to have children, but instead of taking her at her word, the men she dates stress that she would make a great mother.\n\nThen there’s fast-talking Henderson, 31, who, despite not having a job besides the day trading he claims to do, expects his fiancée Ashley Carpenter, a 34-year-old claims manager, to pack up and move to either Arizona or Florida, her possible promotion be damned. Carpenter’s dad, a MAGA “patriarch,” barely lets his wife speak during the family’s meeting with Henderson and later touts his own daughter’s attractiveness as being “dyn-o-mite.”\n\nAt a time when women are outpacing men in obtaining college degrees and are narrowing the pay gap in some cities, some of the guys in Love Is Blind’s recent seasons also seem to react poorly to having high-achieving partners.\n\nLast year in Denver, Jordan Keltner couldn’t seem to move past his insecurities around fiancée Megan Walerius’ wealth, ultimately leading to their breakup after he said he was too “tired” to have conversations with her after work or keep up with her rich-person hobbies. This season, Fusco, a 33-year-old account executive, gets a tour of his doctor fiancée Jessica Barrett's multi-bedroom Ohio home and later demeans her for not going to pilates every day. “I don't care if she’s a neurosurgeon or if she’s a goddamn $100-million trust fund,\" he says, while complaining about their lack of sexual chemistry before spending a chunk of time trying to convince already-engaged contestant Bri McNess that she needs a “dominant” man like him."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

            "content": "Hair loss isn’t always dramatic. It can be incremental. You start noticing a bit more scalp in harsh bathroom lighting; a tiny bald spot when you tie your hair up in a ponytail. The shower drain is more clogged than usual. Not long ago, hair loss treatments meant topical remedies, supplements, or a flight to Turkey. Luckily, red light therapy brings the potential for hair regrowth into your home—no clinical appointment required.\n\nBeyond skin rejuvenation, research suggests red light therapy can help energize hair follicles, increase blood circulation in the scalp, reduce inflammation, and lower dihydrotestosterone levels—a hormone that causes hair loss and thinning. Red light therapy also supports adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which helps provide oxygen and blood flow to the scalp and triggers follicles to remain in the hair growth phase.\n\nTo determine the best red light therapy for hair growth, I tapped three WIRED tech reviewers who've dealt with hair loss themselves. We assessed red light therapy caps, hands-free helmets with full scalp coverage, and low-level laser therapy or photobiomodulation devices for 16 weeks. Along the way, we reviewed the research, spoke with dermatologists, and tracked ease of use. These are the favorites that produced meaningful results and earned our trust.\n\nBe sure to check out our other hair care guides, including Best Dry Shampoos, Best Heat Protectant Sprays, and Best Hair Dryers.\n\nBest Red Light Helmet\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins\n\nPhotograph: Molly Higgins Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet $860 CurrentBody WIRED/TIRED AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED Simple device with only one button and a charging port\n\nBluetooth-enabled so you can listen to your own tunes during treatment\n\nComes with a stand for easy storage\n\nObserved new hair on scalp after 12-ish weeks TIRED Need to use daily for at least four months to achieve results, and use regularly (nearly every day) for maintenance\n\nEven the smallest helmet size is large\n\nBuffer cups can snag and pull hair during helmet removal\n\nEar cups can be somewhat difficult to adjust while worn\n\nCurrentBody's LED Hair Growth Helmet is a wearable, cord-free, Bluetooth-enabled device aimed at improving hair’s density, thickness, and overall condition. Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee say they’ve identified more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses tied to identity theft connected to four major breaches involving data broker firms. The estimate was released Friday in a minority report stemming from a months-long inquiry into data broker practices launched by United States senator Maggie Hassan.\n\nHassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the JEC’s ranking member, sent investigative requests to five major data brokers—Comscore, Findem, IQVIA Digital, Telesign, and 6Sense Insights—in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines using “no index” instructions that tell web crawlers not to list the page.\n\nScammers are shown to use the kind of sensitive data that companies like these hold—including identifiers like dates of birth, addresses, and even Social Security numbers—to target victims with personalized fraud.\n\nFour of the companies took steps after Hassan’s outreach to improve access to opt-out options, including by removing the “no index” code, adding more prominent links, and posting guidance on exercising privacy rights.\n\nFindem, however, did not respond to Hassan or to committee staff follow-up, and staff said the company has not removed the “no index” code from its page. WIRED’s calls to Findem on Thursday went unanswered.\n\nThe report says Findem’s “failure to respond” to the lawmakers’ inquiries raises “serious, broad questions about its responsiveness to opt-out requests and commitment to data privacy,” adding that its own mandatory disclosures from 2024 show the company “did not process 80 percent of privacy requests from consumers and other parties,” citing “insufficient data.”\n\nIQVIA, 6sense, and Comscore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Telesign routes press inquiries through an online form that requires reporters to consent to receiving marketing communications, which was not used for that reason; instead, a company email address that appeared in previously leaked breach data was tried.\n\nThe Markup/CalMatters investigation found that dozens of California-registered data brokers were using the “no index” code and other so-called dark patterns that make opt-out and deletion pages harder to find. “In doing so,” the JEC minority report says, “the companies made it more difficult for people to protect their information from scammers.”\n\nComscore told the committee it reviewed its website after receiving Hassan’s request and found that its “Data Subject Rights” page—which directs users to separate forms for submitting opt-out requests—contained a “no index” code. The company said it traced the code, which it removed, back to an earlier version of the page created in 2003. The report says the company could not determine why it was added, but suggested it was “not intended to prevent consumer access.”\n\nTelesign confirmed that its opt-out form, hosted on a “Privacy Request” page, was not appearing in search results at the time of the Markup/CalMatters reporting; it attributed the issue to a third-party SEO tool that restricts visibility by default, and says it has now enabled indexing and added a footer link to the form.\n\nJEC staff say Telesign’s approach still directs consumers to look beyond its main site and, even where links exist, they’re often buried on pages users wouldn’t reasonably think to check—including privacy notice pages exceeding 9,000 words.\n\n6sense disputed that its main “Privacy Center” was hidden, but acknowledged that its “Privacy Policy” page—which links to opt-out tools—previously carried “no index” code, adding that it removed the code after the Markup/CalMatters report. 6sense was the only company to report using third-party audits to assess both the visibility of opt-out options and whether the requests are being successfully processed, the report says."

            "content": "Wondering what you should watch next on HBO Max?\n\nThe renamed streaming service offers a variety of titles, including Warner Bros. movies like Dune and HBO originals such as Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off. Below, you'll find a batch of can't-miss films and a look at new releases for the month. If you're still trying to figure out if HBO Max is right for you, skim our review of the Warner Bros. Discovery streamer.\n\nNew releases for February\n\nNote: These descriptions are taken from HBO Max statements and official websites for the films. They've been lightly edited for style.\n\nFeb. 6\n\nBoys Go to Jupiter (2024): Adult animated film. A teenager in suburban Florida desperately hustles to make $5,000 in this dreamy and surreal coming-of-age story.\n\nFeb. 20\n\nDead of Winter (2025): Psychological thriller. A grief-stricken loner (Emma Thompson) caught in a blizzard discovers a young woman imprisoned, forcing this unlikely hero into a dangerous fight for her and the victim's survival.\n\nFeb. 27\n\nChris Fleming: Live at the Palace (2026): Comedy special. Fleming bursts onto the screen with a fun and lighthearted blend of skillful storytelling and wild physicality in his first HBO stand-up special.\n\nThe best movies to watch\n\n\n\nThe films below include notable new releases and blockbusters, HBO and HBO Max originals, and Warner Bros. films made exclusively for HBO Max.\n\nDrama\n\nWarner Bros. One Battle After Another (2025) One Battle After Another won best musical or comedy film at the Golden Globes and is up for best picture at the Oscars, so it's worth noting that HBO Max is showing this collab between Paul Thomas Anderson and Leonardo DiCaprio. The political thriller introduces DiCaprio's character as part of a revolutionary group, the French 75. When the film finds him 16 years later, living off the grid with his teenage daughter and facing a threat from his past, the action doesn't let up.\n\nA24 Sing Sing (2024) Sing Sing is a subtle and impactful prison drama starring Colman Domingo -- who earned a 2025 best actor Oscar nomination for his role -- and formerly incarcerated actors. Domingo plays Divine G, who acts in a theater group while imprisoned at Sing Sing Correctional Facility. The film will surprise and uplift you.\n\nWarner Bros. Juror #2 (2024) Nicholas Hoult, J.K. Simmons and Toni Collette are in the cast of this absorbing, haunting Clint Eastwood courtroom drama. Hoult stars as Justin Kemp, who faces a moral dilemma after getting called for jury duty. He must decide whether to disclose information that would change the outcome of the high-profile trial and impact his own life. A well-acted, well-paced flick that will get you thinking.\n\nHBO Max Turtles All the Way Down (2024) Don't usually dabble in the young adult genre? You shouldn't let that keep you from taking in Turtles All the Way Down, based on a 2017 novel of the same name by John Green. The film stars Isabela Merced (The Last of Us, Alien: Romulus) as a teen who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder and anxiety. With elements of romance and a captivating performance from Merced, this straight-to-streaming movie deserves more attention.\n\nWarnerMedia The Fallout (2022) After a shooting occurs at her high school, 16-year-old Vada Cavell must navigate friendships, school and her relationship with her family. The Fallout skillfully approaches serious subject matter with realistic dialogue and compassion for its characters. With strong performances from stars Jenna Ortega as Vada and Maddie Ziegler as her new friend Mia Reed, the feature will keep you glued to the screen for the entirety of its 90-minute runtime.\n\nWarner Bros. Dune (2021) and Dune: Part Two (2024) Remember 2021, when Warner Bros. movies hit HBO Max on the same day they premiered in theaters? That exciting period may be over but at least we'll always have the memory of watching Denis Villeneuve's spectacular sci-fi epic at home and still being part of the conversation. Both parts of Dune are now streaming on HBO Max.\n\nHBO Bad Education (2019) Based on a magazine article by journalist Robert Kolker, this tale about a public school embezzlement scandal and the student journalists who broke the news is captivating from start to finish. Allison Janney and Hugh Jackman are great in their roles as the school officials who took part in the scheme. The drama also won the 2020 Emmy award for Outstanding Television Movie.\n\nThriller\n\nWarner Bros. Kimi (2022) Steven Soderbergh directs this engaging tech thriller set during the COVID-19 pandemic. Angela, a Seattle tech worker played by a neon blue-haired Zoë Kravitz, has agoraphobia, a fear that prevents her from making it past the front door of her apartment. But when she uncovers an unsettling recording while doing her job, she's pushed to make the leap. Kimi is a stylish thriller complete with eye-catching cinematography, a solid score and a protagonist you'll be rooting for.\n\nHBO Max No Sudden Move (2021) A movie from Steven Soderbergh, the great director behind Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven and, more recently, Logan Lucky? Twists, thrills and desperate characters populate this crime thriller set in 1950s Detroit. When a seemingly simple job gets out of hand, a group of criminals must work together to uncover what's really going on. Take in the incredible cast: Don Cheadle, Benicio del Toro, David Harbour, Jon Hamm and Amy Seimetz. While the plot can be a little convoluted and some won't be able to get past the fish-eye lens cinematography, Soderbergh's sense of humor and immersive direction make this crime caper an entertaining night in.\n\nComedy\n\nHBO Max Am I OK? (2022) This comedy-drama follows Dakota Johnson's character, 32-year-old Lucy, who tells her longtime best friend Jane that she likes women. But there's more for Lucy to navigate as that friend, played by House of the Dragon's Sonoya Mizuno, is moving far away to London. If you enjoy stories about late blooming and female friendships, it's no question -- you should check out the funny, touching Am I OK?\n\nWarner Bros. Father of the Bride (2022) HBO Max's Father of the Bride introduces a Cuban American family that includes patriarch Billy, a traditional guy who struggles to digest surprising news from his eldest daughter: She's met a guy, and she wants to marry and move away with him. The third film adaptation of a 1949 novel of the same name by Edward Streeter, the movie is an enjoyable iteration that includes stars like Andy Garcia and singer Gloria Estefan.\n\nHBO Max Let Them All Talk (2020) Meryl Streep playing an eccentric author in a Steven Soderbergh comedy. What more do you need to know? If you do want to know more: Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Alice Hughes (Streep) is struggling to finish her next book, chased by her literary agent (Gemma Chan). She boards a cruise ship with old friends, who inspired her best-known work. Tensions are strong. It looks great -- Soderbergh uses crisp, natural light -- and most of the dialogue is improvised. See how Dianne Wiest, Candice Bergen, Lucas Hedges and the rest of the impeccable cast have fun with that.\n\nSuperhero\n\nJessica Miglio/Warner Bros. Superman (2025) James Gunn's superhero epic doesn't go the origin story route, instead introducing audiences to David Corenswet's Man of Steel when Earth is already familiar with the caped hero. More specifically, the movie opens with a battered Superman having lost a battle for the first time. Nicholas Hoult plays the ever-plotting villain Lex Luthor, Rachel Brosnahan stars as reporter Lois Lane and Krypto the unruly Superdog is a chaotic addition to this charming and compelling action outing.\n\nWarner Bros. The Batman (2022) Robert Pattinson steps out as Batman in this moody superhero flick directed by Matt Reeves. The movie takes place in a perpetually gray and rain-soaked Gotham City, where Bruce Wayne starts to seek out a murderer with an affinity for riddles. Along the way, he meets Catwoman, played by a swaggering Zoë Kravitz. Catch up on the dark and satisfying mystery before you watch the HBO spinoff series, The Penguin.\n\nWarner Bros. The Suicide Squad (2021) Over-the-top violence abounds in this DC film about supervillains who agree to help the US government in exchange for some time off their prison sentences. Their mission is to destroy something alluded to as Project Starfish, harbored in the fictional island country of Corto Maltese. With a notable cast that includes Margot Robbie, Idris Elba and John Cena, 2021's The Suicide Squad is a wickedly entertaining, darkly funny bloodbath that differs from what you usually see in superhero movies. (Peacemaker, a spin-off TV series, is also available on HBO Max.)\n\nMusical\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Wonka (2023) Dune's Timothée Chalamet stars in this prequel to Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and it's a total treat. With new and familiar tunes, a committed cast and oodles and oodles of whimsy, the film allows audiences to get to know a young Willy Wonka with giraffe-sized ambition and undeniable chocolate-making skill. It's a quirky, comforting flick from Paddington director Paul King that you'll absolutely want on your plate.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures The Color Purple (2023) This movie musical version of The Color Purple is adapted from Alice Walker's 1982 novel and the Broadway play. Set in the early 1900s, the film tells the story of Celie, a Black woman living in the South who faces multiple hardships but is able to find strength in the bonds in her life. The cast includes Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Colman Domingo, Halle Bailey and Danielle Brooks, who received a 2023 Oscar nomination for her role as Celie's daughter-in-law, Sofia.\n\nAction and adventure\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Mickey 17 (2025) Mickey 17 comes from acclaimed director Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, Parasite) and stars Robert Pattinson as Mickey Barnes. Barnes escapes Earth for another planet by applying to be an \"expendable.\" The role subjects him to deadly missions and experiments, with his body reprinted each time he doesn't make it. Black humor, heart, eccentricity and great performances are all on display. Even if the film doesn't surpass any of Bong's earlier works, it deservedly makes it on this list.\n\nJanus Films Flow (2024) Winner of Best Animated Feature at the 2025 Oscars, this wordless Latvian film follows a black cat after a great flood devastates his home.

Pictures Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) This thrilling prequel to the 2015 movie Mad Max: Fury Road stars Anya Taylor-Joy (The Queen's Gambit, The Menu) as a younger version of Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa. Life takes a turn for the protagonist when she finds herself in the Wasteland rather than the Green Place of Many Mothers. The resourceful heroine fights for survival, facing off with villains such as the warlord Dementus, played by Chris Hemsworth. Visually striking and intense, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is chock-full of postapocalyptic action, and you won't want to miss a minute.\n\nStudio Ghibli The Boy and the Heron (2023) Who can pass up a Studio Ghibli film? Hayao Miyazaki came out of retirement to make The Boy and the Heron, which won the award for best animated feature at the 2024 Oscars. The starry English voice cast includes Christian Bale, Willem Dafoe, Robert Pattinson and Florence Pugh.\n\nJaap Buitendijk/Warner Bros. Barbie (2023) Unless you've been living in Barbie Land (or another place that isn't the real world), chances are you're very familiar with this pink-coated comedy already. The flick -- Warner Bros.' highest-grossing global release of all time -- brings a long list of stars together for a hilarious and heartfelt adventure. Greta Gerwig directs, Margot Robbie plays the titular role and Ryan Gosling belts out an incredible power ballad as Ken.\n\nDocumentary\n\nHBO All That Breathes (2022) This captivating documentary is filled with images that will stick with you. It centers on two brothers in New Delhi who run a bird hospital dedicated to black kites -- birds of prey that are a staple of the sky. It was a contender for best documentary feature at the 2023 Oscars.\n\nHBO Max Tony Hawk: Until the Wheels Fall Off (2022) Tune into this HBO doc for the gravity-defying skateboard stunts, a time capsule of the '80s skateboarding scene, and a version of Hawk you've probably never seen.

Fans and those less acquainted with the late star will likely appreciate this two-hour look at his life."

            "content": "The Clicks Communicator created a buzz after its CES reveal, with its focus on offering a communications-forward Android phone that looks like a BlackBerry, complete with a physical keyboard, prioritizing messaging and typing over everything else. It turns out the keyboard phone may have made a bigger splash than anyone realized. Clicks will offer multiple versions of the Communicator, each with a keyboard that supports a different language, in response to the overwhelming demand for the unreleased phone.\n\nThe company is expanding the Communicator to include models with keyboard layouts for Arabic, French (AZERTY), German (QWERTZ) and Korean. Clicks said interest in the Communicator was higher than the company expected, especially globally.\n\nIt's clear there are still plenty of people who yearn for compelling, straightforward devices with smartly designed hardware that aim to make texting and writing easier. The timing of Click's news strikes a stark juxtaposition, coming just days after Samsung launched its Galaxy S26 series, which features updates heavily steeped in AI.\n\nHere is the Clicks Communicator in Smoke with a keyboard for Korean. Clicks/CNET\n\n\"The response from customers around the world sends a strong signal that Communicator fills a gap for a phone purpose-built for communicating and taking action,\" Clicks CEO Adrian Li Mow Ching said in a press release.\n\nBut there's more good news ahead of MWC if you're interested in getting a Clicks Communicator. The early-bird window to reserve one now runs through March 15. The phone costs $499, but an early reservation gets you a $100 discount and, when paid in full, a bundle of the phone and two additional back covers.\n\nClicks also shared that the phone will have a Dimensity 8300 chip (MT8883), which is in phones like the Xiaomi Poco X6 Pro. The MT8883 lets the company offer OS updates to the Communicator through Android 20 and five years of security updates.\n\nI'm definitely excited to see where Clicks is headed with the Communicator, but should note that we've yet to see a working version of the phone. The Clicks Communicator will be available in Smoke, Clover and Onyx. Reservations are open, and people can select their preferred keyboard layout closer to when the phone ships later this year."

            "content": "Smart locks are a highly visible part of your home that you'll use just about every day, so it's important to find a reliable pick that meshes well with your smart home. Here are the factors you should be thinking about as you shop.\n\nA retrofit smart lock like the August lock will replace the interior of your current lock but not the exterior keyhole or the deadbolt. CNET\n\nFull deadbolt or retrofit\n\nMost smart locks will replace your existing lock, including the interior thumbturn, the exterior keyhole and the deadbolt in the middle. Locks like those will also come with their keys, replacing the ones you use now.\n\nOthers, like the August Smart Lock, and the Lockly fingerprint model, are designed instead to work with at least some of your existing lock hardware. With a retrofit lock like that, you probably won't need new keys and might not even need to swap out the deadbolt. Locks like those can sometimes be a better fit for apartments, where the building owners might not allow you to replace the entire lock.\n\nYale's smart lock can work with the Nest video doorbell. Yale\n\nModes of access\n\nDifferent smart locks will take different approaches to letting you in. On a basic level, most smart locks will let you lock and unlock the door wirelessly from your phone, using an app. Others add in keypads for coded entry, which can help you rely on your keys a little less while also making it easier to share access with others. Some lock add fingerprint or palm scanning to let you inside with biometrics. There are also keypad and NFC options, even face scanning in some cases.\n\nApple has also added a Home Key feature in iOS15 that lets you store a digital house key in your Apple Wallet, which lets you open compatible smart locks using the NFC radio in your iPhone or Apple Watch. Many other brands have followed suit with digital passes that guests can download on their phones with the right apps.\n\nSo, what's right for you? Going into an app for door access isn't ideal unless you are controlling it remotely. That's why we like Bluetooth and NFC passes that can work with a wave of your phone, as well as fingerprint sensors and similar options that are keyed to individuals and work at a touch at any time. But a keypad has its advantages as well, since it allows for temporary code handouts or limited-time access without someone needing their phone or a specific app to use.\n\nThe Schlage Encode Plus is the first smart lock to support Apple Home Key. It lets you unlock your door using an iPhone or Apple Watch. Schlage\n\nPlatform compatibility and Matter\n\nIf your household includes multiple types of smart home devices, then your best bet is to control them all from a single smart home platform. That way, you won't need to juggle multiple apps to keep everything automated. The most popular picks are Amazon Alexa, the Google Home app and the Google Assistant voice controls that come with it, and Apple HomeKit, which brings Siri into play. Samsung SmartThings is another option for a hub-centric smart home.\n\nThat brings us to Matter. Matter (and its tagalong communication protocol Thread) is an important smart home protocol designed in coordination with major brands, including Google, Amazon, Apple, and many others. It helps guarantee compatibility across different platforms and adds extra security and data transfer benefits, which buyers should definitely be watching for.\n\nCurrently, smart lock companies are still adopting the Matter standard. Our top pick uses it and is one of the best options we've found. Schlage has begun to adopt the standard for locks like its upcoming Schlage Sense Pro, but it hasn't made its way to our Schlage Smart Lever pick quite yet, and the same goes for Yale Assure. Brands like Aqara are now including built-in Matter support with their latest locks. August has also announced it's working to bring Matter to its smart locks, so in some cases, it just be a \"matter\" of waiting for the right firmware update.\n\nAqara's lock comes with many unlocking options and gets even more features if you plug in a hub. Aqara\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nSmart locks aren't quite as data-sensitive as devices with built-in cameras and microphones, but you'll still want to make sure that you're keeping things secure. Most, if not all of your options will use some form of encryption to keep the wireless transmissions between your lock and your phone or home network secure. You should also look for locks that use two-factor authentication to keep your account safe from malicious logins. As with any connected device in your home, you'll want to be sure to keep your lock updated to the latest firmware and to set a strong password in the app.\n\nAs for lockpicking and other physical concerns, you can look for the lock's ANSI grade to get a sense of its durability, and how well it might stand up against a brute-force entry attack. ANSI grade 3 is the most basic rating, but a growing number of smart locks offer ANSI grade 2 or grade 1 ratings, which tell you that they're built with commercial-grade durability. If you're concerned about forced entries, a lock like that might be a good investment.\n\nLockin's Veno Pro 7 components John Carlsen/CNET\n\nDesign considerations\n\nYour smart lock is going to sit right on the front of your home's exterior, so it's worth aiming for something you won't hate looking at. Some smart locks go out of their way to show off their gadgety features with light-up touchscreens, color-coded LED indicator lights and tech-minded designs. Others take the opposite approach, doing their best to blend in and look just like a standard lock, from the outside at least. Picking a preference between the two approaches will help you narrow your options.\n\nYou'll also want to consider how the lock stays powered. Most smart locks will run off four AA batteries, but some take a different approach. The minimalistic Level Lock +, for instance, runs off two AA batteries that sits inside of the deadbolt itself to keep things extra compact. Meanwhile, Eufy's touchscreen smart lock runs off of a rechargeable battery pack.\n\nWi-Fi\n\nWi-Fi support has now become common for smart locks, but it's important to look at the details. Some locks don't have built-in Wi-Fi, but only support it if you buy an additional hub."

            "content": "Pokemon Winds and Waves, the first mainline games in the series to come to the Nintendo Switch 2, were announced on Friday, the franchise's 30th anniversary, on a special Pokemon Presents livestream. They will be released in 2027 exclusively on the Switch 2.\n\nFollowing the precedent set by Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, the new games seem to be set in a fully explorable open world. The new playable region is scattered across multiple islands, with wide swaths of ocean between them.\n\nThe distinct split between water and land harkens back to cherished gameplay mechanics from third-generation Pokemon games Ruby and Sapphire, which were first released in Japan in 2002.\n\nAs tradition dictates, we got our first look at the three new starter Pokemon, which are powerful pals that serve as the player's first partner in an unfamiliar new place.\n\nThe grass-type starter, Browt, is a chickadee with a head that's bulbous enough to invoke the Brain. The water-type, Gecqua, is a quadrupedal gecko with a cool attitude. And the fire-type starter, Pombon, is a super cute orange pup with a mane that eclipses its body. (I suspect Pombon will quickly become a fan favorite.)\n\nFan-favorite Pokemon from previous games were also shown off. Pikachu, Tympole, Wailord, Tropius and Frillish are in the cast of monsters to be caught in the next mainline Pokemon games, among other older creatures. Many of the returning Pokemon seem to fit into the island theme, residing in volcanic caves (where we saw Slugma), marshy swamps (Carnivine) and underwater coves (Lumineon).\n\nIt's been four years since the last mainline Pokemon games -- Pokemon Scarlet and Violet -- were released for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nWhile those games were lauded by some fans for their open world and more freeform approach to telling a Pokemon story, they were held back by poor performance and game-breaking bugs on Nintendo's first hybrid console. Pokemon Winds and Waves -- games built for, and exclusive to, the more powerful Switch 2 hardware -- need to fare better when it comes to in-game performance.\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves may be the first traditional Pokemon games for the Switch 2, but they aren't the first ventures into the world of pocket monsters for the new console. The recently released Pokemon Legends: Z-A introduced a whole new battling system, moving away from the turn-based mechanics the franchise has been known for since 1996. Pokemon Pokopia, an Animal Crossing-style game that will be released next month, is also primed to bring pocket monsters to cozy gaming spaces.\n\nNintendo also announced that the upcoming, competition-focused Pokemon Champions will be released on the Switch in April and is coming to mobile devices later this year.\n\nThese games will have to tide fans over until they can dive into the watery world of Pokemon Winds and Waves next year."

Pokemon Day is chock-full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world, and this stream didn't disappoint.\n\nWhile the beginning of February's Pokemon Presents focused primarily on the plethora of pocket monster mobile games, like Pokemon Go and Pokemon TCG Pocket, we also learned about quite a few new games. The presentation culminated in the reveal of Pokemon Winds and Waves, the gen-10 mainline games and the first Pokemon games to be developed exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nHere's everything The Pokemon Company announced for 2026 and beyond during its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year. Whether you're looking to relive old games for the first time or dive into a brand-new generation of pocket monsters, there's something for every Pokemon fan to get excited about right now.\n\nBrowt, Pombon and Gecqua are the newest partner Pokemon. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves\n\nThe first mainline Pokemon games developed exclusively for the Switch 2 have been revealed. Pokemon Winds and Waves are the gen-10 Pokemon games, and they take place in a new region full of volcanic crags, murky swamplands and lots of water.\n\nWe got our first look at the partner Pokemon -- Browt, Pombon and Gecqua -- but no other new Pokemon made their debut in this trailer. Keep your eyes peeled for additional information about new pocket monster species and box art legendaries in the coming months.\n\nPokemon Winds and Waves will be released in 2027. Expect our sibling site IGN to score these ones 7.8/10.\n\nDifferent generational mechanics clash in Pokemon Champions. Nintendo\n\nPokemon Champions gets a release date... sort of\n\nPokemon Champions, the competitive battling game that was revealed during the July 2025 Pokemon Presents, made a notable appearance in the latest stream. While we still don't know the exact date Pokemon Champions will become publicly available, we know it will be released for the Switch and Switch 2 sometime during April. The game will also come out on mobile devices later this year.\n\nPokemon Champions aims to standardize competitive Pokemon battling by unifying the gimmicks from all nine generations of mainline Pokemon games -- including Mega evolutions, Dynamax Pokemon, and Terastallization -- into a single format. Players will be able to transfer their favorite Pokemon from the mainline games to Pokemon Champions in order to battle one another, with cross-platform play supported between Switch and mobile devices.\n\nI could've sworn that this shadow Lugia was intimidating in 2005. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nPokemon XD: Gale of Darkness for Switch 2\n\nIt's an oldie but a goodie. Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, the game that introduced the awe-inspiring corrupted Lugia back in 2005, will be released exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 Online + Expansion Pack subscribers in March. Gale of Darkness is fondly remembered as a challenging title with plenty of fan-favorite shadow Pokemon forms, so it'll be good to have this nostalgic classic on the current generation of Nintendo hardware.\n\nA Pokemon music collection in Game Boy form? Yes. Nintendo\n\nGame Boy Jukebox featuring music from Pokemon Red and Blue\n\nThe Game Boy Advance is back. Well, not really, but a very small jukebox taking the form of the beloved handheld console will be released today. This initial Game Boy Jukebox collection comes with 45 different cartridges -- each one plays a classic chiptune song from Pokemon Red and Blue, the original gen-1 Pokemon games from 30 years ago.\n\nI think 45 different cartridges might be a little bit of overkill, but it's certainly authentic to the old console experience. It remains to be seen whether more classic GBA games will get their own chiptune cartridges for the Game Boy Jukebox. There are no pricing details for the device yet.\n\nLegendary Pokemon cards from previous runs are likely to return in a new legacy expansion set. The Pokemon Company/Screenshot by CNET\n\nA mysterious new TCG collection\n\nThe scalping will continue until morale improves. The next trading card game collection (which was teased but not named during the Pokemon Presents stream) is designed to celebrate 30 years of Pokemon's legacy.\n\nSeveral cards from different generations of the Pokemon TCG were shown off, revamped and revitalized to receive play in 2026. Notable inclusions were Pikachu and Charizard from the original base set, Palkia, Darkrai and Azelf from the Diamond and Pearl sets and the Pikachu and Zekrom tag team card from 2019. This mystery set seems to be bringing back the greatest hits -- assuming you're able to find packs in stores anywhere near you.\n\nHow to watch the Pokemon Day presentation video\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, so the livestream aired on its YouTube, Twitch, TikTok and Instagram accounts. If you want to watch the VOD and catch up on all of the latest Pokemon news for yourself, I've embedded The Pokemon Company's video of every announcement above, or you can view the announcement on any of its social media channels."

            "content": "Peloton announced today that it’s launching its first 12-week Hyrox Training Program to help members prepare for the race. Peloton previously hinted at this program when it launched its new cross-training equipment line in October.\n\nThis training program is intended to coincide with the Hyrox NYC race taking place from May 28 to May 31, and from June 4 to June 7. Hyrox has become increasingly popular among hybrid athletes (those who do strength and cardio workouts), and Peloton is leaning in to support competitive fitness athletes looking to try something new or challenge themselves.\n\nWhat is Hyrox?\n\nPeloton instructors, Andy Speer and Adrian Williams participating at a Hyrox competition. Peloton\n\nHyrox is known for its challenging courses that include eight functional workout stations and running 1 kilometer (a little over half a mile) eight times. Some people join teams, while others go at it alone. Regardless of how you sign up, it requires preparation and strategy to succeed.\n\n“This program will train your engine… train your strength, and you will train your mind to stay sharp when fatigue hits,” said Robin Arzón, Peloton head instructor and vice president of fitness programming, and a certified Hyrox performance coach. In a statement, she said that the program’s goal is to do more than just get you through the race. “We are building you to own it.”\n\nWhat Peloton Hyrox workouts will look like\n\nRobin Arzón will be one of the instructors teaching the Peloton Hyrox Training Program. Peloton\n\nIf you \n\nAerobic Power: Teaches athletes how to manage effort and build endurance.\n\nSimple Tools, High Impact: Learn how to develop hybrid endurance.\n\nEfficiency Over Speed: Use smart pacing and conserve energy during the course.\n\nProgressive Volume: Train through cumulative fatigue and intentional loading.\n\nPerformance Drivers: Recover and fuel properly during a training cycle.\n\nMembers will get to train for this race through Peloton classes they already enjoy, such as Tread bootcamps, strength, rowing and mobility/stretching. The first six weeks of the cross-training program will focus on building up your aerobic capacity and establishing threshold control.\n\nFor the second half, athletes will go through a 75-minute simulation of the race to test out pacing and transition skills. The final weeks will add another challenge by focusing on “real demand” training, which will have heavy sled pushes, wall balls and a run.\n\nThe program is designed to be customizable, whether you’re a Hyrox newbie or an experienced athlete. You’ll learn the mechanics and how to transition between stations, and get used to your race weights based on where you are in your plan.\n\nCoaches you can expect to see teaching these classes include Robin Arzón, Andy Speer, Ash Pryor, Adrian Williams, Logan Aldridge, Chelsea Jackson Roberts, Joslyn Thompson Rule and Alex Karwoski.\n\nPeloton’s Hyrox Training Program is now available on the Peloton app and hardware. You can also connect with other community members training for a Hyrox through the Official Hyrox Training Team on the Peloton app."

            "content": "Whenever we go online, our activity is tracked, monitored, recorded and analyzed, while the associated data is shared, bought, traded and sold. The digital crumbs we leave in our online footsteps are abundant, and maintaining any semblance of privacy on the internet is a continuous challenge.\n\nThe natural response to such an alarming lack of privacy is to put up walls, retreat into a shell and try to become anonymous. It’s that reflex that many VPNs build their marketing around, peddling inflated claims about how their product can make you completely anonymous online. But complete online anonymity is a myth.\n\nTo be fair, not all VPN companies are pushing this false narrative -- CNET’s picks for the best VPNs are all very clear about what their services can and can’t do. But too many companies, including a few high-profile VPN providers, continue to keep the myth alive.\n\nEven a VPN provider as established and well-known as CyberGhost continues to promote this dangerous falsehood. The company boldly states on its website that its service can help users “go completely anonymous and surf the internet without privacy worries,” and that they can “enjoy complete anonymity & protection online” with CyberGhost.\n\nEnlarge Image CyberGhost makes dangerous claims about anonymity on its website. CyberGhost/Screenshot by CNET\n\nTo be fair, CyberGhost does mention in an FAQ section tucked away at the bottom of its home page that “no VPN service can make you 100% anonymous online,” but the messaging from the company is nonetheless confusing and avoidable.\n\nThis isn’t just a case of harmless exaggerated marketing -- it’s reckless. Using a VPN while under the impression that it’s a silver bullet for online anonymity can put you in a bad spot, even if you have nothing to hide. If you use a social media platform to share sensitive information online with someone, or if you’re an investigative journalist in a region whose government practices oppressive digital surveillance, you’ll still be at risk, even with a VPN.\n\nYou can’t simply throw good judgment and all other basic privacy principles out the window just because you think your VPN gives you an all-encompassing invisibility cloak on the internet whenever you switch it on. It’s time to dial back the hyperbole and be clear about how a VPN can and can’t protect you online, starting with why all this talk about data matters.\n\nYour information is out there, and almost everyone wants it\n\nWhether used by governments to spy on citizens and adversaries or by companies like Google and Meta to profit off of user data, the internet has been an incredibly efficient surveillance tool for decades. It was only after former NSA contractor and whistleblower Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013 that the public really began to grasp the extent of the online surveillance and internet privacy issues in general came more to the forefront.\n\nA few years later, the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 helped illustrate not only the vast amount of data Big Tech was collecting without our consent, but also how outside companies were piggybacking off of that data collection for their own purposes.\n\nWhenever you’re logged in to a service like Google, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, Amazon or Netflix, all of your activity on those platforms can be tracked by the companies and linked directly back to you. Data related to the search terms you enter, links you click on, videos you watch, items you purchase, ads you interact with and content you share are all collected and used to create a detailed profile on your interests and online habits.\n\nAdditionally, personal information such as your name, username, address, payment data and email address, along with unique identifiers like your IP address, browser type, device type and operating system can all be tracked.\n\nYour internet provider can track things like your web browsing history, location, app usage and metadata. Fitness and financial apps can collect sensitive health and financial data. Websites use cookies and device fingerprinting, and social media platforms use pixels to track your activity across the web.\n\nThat information can be collected and sold to data brokers, who further treat your personal information like valuable currency.\n\nData privacy legislation like Europe’s GDPR and California’s CCPA help people take more control over how their data is collected and processed, but these laws can only do so much. Surveillance capitalism is so ingrained into how Big Tech operates that having our actions online tracked in one way or another is becoming increasingly unavoidable. With all the ways in which we’re being tracked, online anonymity is only possible if you don’t go online at all.\n\nA VPN can help boost your privacy, but there are many limitations\n\nWith a VPN, you can give your privacy a boost and put a small dent into the scope of data collected on you when you go online. A VPN encrypts your online traffic while routing it through a secure server in a remote location that you choose. This process achieves two objectives critical to improving your privacy: It hides your internet activity from your internet provider, network administrator, government and other online snoops, and it changes your actual IP address to that of the VPN server you connect through.\n\nGetty Images/Zooey Liao/CNET\n\nThis way, you can keep your online activity hidden from certain key entities while also preventing the sites and services you use from detecting your actual physical location and tracking you based on your IP address. VPNs are great for protecting your privacy, limiting certain kinds of tracking and data collection, evading firewalls at work or school and spoofing your IP address and location to bypass georestrictions.\n\nThat’s a useful set of features, but there are still plenty of ways for data to get through your VPN.\n\nSome VPNs include ad and tracker blockers, along with surface level malware and phishing protection features, but (other than Windscribe’s anti-fingerprinting feature) most VPNs cannot guard against tracking through browser fingerprinting. Your browser fingerprint can expose information like your time zone, screen resolution, browser type, operating system, extensions, language preferences and IP address. All of this information taken together can be used by advertisers to build detailed profiles on internet users, governments to surveil citizens and even cybercriminals to commit identity theft.\n\nA VPN can’t help hide your identity when you purchase something from Amazon or when you use services like Google or Facebook. These platforms all know it’s you when you interact with them while logged in and are still collecting hoards of data related to your activity whether or not you’re connected to a VPN.\n\nA VPN can’t protect you if you download malware or enter your sensitive information into a phishing site. Privacy protections don’t prevent you from downloading malware or sending your personal information to cybercriminals. Some antivirus services can protect you against these risks, but a VPN won’t.\n\nAnd you’re not anonymous to the VPN itself when using its services because you’re essentially swapping the visibility into your online activity from your internet provider to your VPN provider. That’s fine if your VPN has an audited no-logs policy and runs on RAM-only or full-disk encrypted servers to serve as an extra layer of protection. But there are too many VPNs, especially free services, that put user data at risk or otherwise misuse it.\n\nYet none of this stops some VPN providers from saying that VPNs can make you totally anonymous online.\n\nIn reality, VPNs are just a small piece of the much greater online privacy and security puzzle. VPNs like Mullvad and Windscribe let you sign up and use their services without supplying any personal information whatsoever -- which is about as close as you can get to anonymity with a VPN. Other providers like Proton, NordVPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark offer additional privacy and security services on top of a VPN that you can bundle under a single subscription, which can help you better round out your cybersecurity toolkit.\n\nOther tools for boosting your privacy online\n\nEveryday citizens simply looking to boost their online protections should be fine with a VPN, password manager and antivirus. But if you’re an activist, lawyer, whistleblower, investigative journalist or anyone else with critical privacy needs, there’s a lot more you should do to protect yourself and become as anonymous as possible online.\n\nA great first step is to go with a vetted VPN provider with an audited no-logs policy and make sure to enable the appropriate settings for optimal privacy. On top of that, I recommend leveraging the following tools if you want to be as anonymous as possible online:\n\nTor: Uses “onion routing”\n\nTails operating system: A secure operating system from the Tor Project that you download to a USB stick that runs independently of your computer’s operating system. It boots fresh each time you start it up and wipes all data automatically when you shut it down.\n\nAdblocker: A browser extension like Privacy Badger or Ghostery can help you block ads and trackers from following you around the web.\n\nEncrypted messaging services Signal can help keep your messages private by encrypting the contents.\n\nSignal can help keep your messages private by encrypting the contents. Proton Mail: An encrypted email service from Proton that’s free of trackers and uses end-to-end, zero-access encryption so that only you can access the contents of your emails.\n\nPrivacy-focused browsers: Certain browsers like the Mullvad Browser or Brave can help automatically block ads and trackers and fight against fingerprinting. The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Cover Your Tracks tool can also give you a detailed look into your specific browser fingerprint and reveal exactly how unique it is.\n\nPrivate search engines: Tools like DuckDuckGo or Brave Search are solid private alternatives to the tracking and data collection employed by the likes of Google or Bing.\n\nMore ways to protect your privacy\n\nIn addition to using the tools listed above, I recommend taking the following actions if you’re serious about minimizing your digital footprint and staying as private as possible online:\n\nLimit your social media use and reliance on Google services: Big Tech is a data-hungry machine\n\nCreate burner accounts: Whether it’s an email address\n\nPay in cash or crypto: Credit cards, PayPal, Venmo and personal checks all leave a trail back to you. Cash and crypto do not.\n\nBe careful of what you download: Don’t download random files from unsolicited emails. Be on the lookout for signs of phishing scams\n\nShore up your device’s privacy settings: Make sure app permissions are set to only what the apps need to function. Enable device encryption and set a strong passcode. Disable ad tracking and location services.\n\nBe careful with public Wi-Fi: Only connect to secure Wi-Fi hotspots and use a VPN for extra protection.\n\nRegularly clear your browser cookies and cache improve performance and free up storage space\n\nWhile neither a VPN nor any single privacy or security tool can guarantee you anonymity, a well-rounded cybersecurity toolkit, some strategic actions and a little bit of common sense can go a long way toward protecting your privacy."
