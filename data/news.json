            "content": "ARSENAL host Chelsea this weekend in a huge clash which could be pivotal for both the title and Champions League races.\n\nThe Gunners are five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League as they face the Blues.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam Rosenior‘s top five-chasing visitors represent the most significant test at the Emirates between now and the end of the season.\n\nAnd if there are any naysayers over the importance of tactics, take it from Declan Rice.\n\nThe £105million star told SunSport it was “impossible” to go into a game without being tactically sound.\n\nRice, 27, reserved particular praise for Mikel Arteta, admitting it took him a while to grasp the manager’s impressive sessions.\n\nAnd Arsenal versus Chelsea will come down to them being able to beat the low block Rosenior is likely to set up with, particularly given the history of recent clashes seen in the League Cup at the last game in north London.\n\nChelsea have something of a selection headache with no Marc Cucurella at left-back, leaving a choice of Jorrel Hato or Malo Gusto. Wesley Fofana is also out after his suspension earned at Burnley.\n\nStrangely enough, the way the Gunners could counter the low block is by throwing fewer players forward.\n\nThe idea behind this would be to use Chelsea’s own shape against them to lure them forwards into a higher-press shape, which would then potentially free up space for attacking options such as Bukayo Saka.\n\n\n\nBEST ONLINE CASINOS – TOP SITES IN THE UK\n\nThere is also an argument for Ben White to be selected over Jurrien Timber, who has looked tired due to an extraordinary amount of games.\n\nWhite’s ability to overlap and hold width could be the best way to create additional space between the lines for Saka to exploit, as once again he will be at the heart of everything Arsenal do well.\n\nThe Full Arsenal on YouTube SunSport have launched a dedicated Arsenal channel on YouTube! The Full Arsenal Podcast is your home for everything about the Gunners. From match reactions and tactical breakdowns to transfer talk, match previews, tactical analysis and honest fan debate… The Full Arsenal covers it all. Subscribe to The Full Arsenal here\n\nHowever, Arteta also has a selection headache over Martin Odegaard.\n\nOdegaard is the captain, but Eberechi Eze showed his class with a stunning display in last week’s north London derby, second only to Man of the Match Viktor Gyokeres.\n\nBoth provide key attributes for Arsenal, emphasising the strength in depth they have.\n\n\n\nBut it is very much a case of ‘horses for courses’. That indecision in the Arsenal camp will be playing on Chelsea’s mind in their pre-match prep.\n\nOdegaard, when he plays, is the leader of the Arsenal press, and with Chelsea possessing a number of press-resistant players, that will put pressure on the visitors in dangerous areas.\n\nThe Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube Calling all Chelsea fans - we have a brand new YouTube channel! The Sun’s Chelsea YouTube channel will be your go-to destination for the latest news, transfer updates, match previews, post-match analysis, exclusive interviews, fan reactions, and breaking stories from Stamford Bridge. Subscribe to The Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube now\n\nIf Arsenal get their press right, they will win the ball back with Chelsea off-balance, which will free up the Gunners’ firepower going forward.\n\nEveryone who has watched Arsenal this season is well aware of their proficiency at set-pieces.\n\nRosenior used an interesting counter-move the last time the two teams met by placing players high up the field at corners, meaning Arsenal had to sacrifice some of their own numbers in the box to mark them.\n\n\n\nIt is a move that is becoming more popular, and it’s easy to imagine it will be the same again on Sunday.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThat being said, Arsenal are the best team in the league, possibly the world at set-pieces, so this cat-and-mouse tactic may not be used at every single corner.\n\nThe likes of Reece James or Joao Pedro may see fit to make the decision depending on the flow of the game."

            "content": "FORMER Chelsea star Jody Morris has revealed Frank Lampard did not have a single discussion with owner Roman Abramovich while manager.\n\nThe revelation stunned Premier League icon Joleon Lescott, who labelled the lack of contact “insane”.\n\n\n\n\n\nLampard, 46, boasts the second most Premier League appearances ever for Chelsea, behind John Terry.\n\nBut his certified legend status did not help him break the ice when he was brought back to the club years after his retirement in a new role as head coach.\n\nLampard stepped away from the club in 2014, but was hired half a decade later to steady the ship after Maurizio Sarri departed as manager.\n\nBut according to the former England man’s assistant coach Morris, 47, Lampard had no contact with club chairman Abramovich during his 18-months in charge between 2019 and early 2021.\n\nInstead the assistant and former Blues midfielder claimed that club director Marina Granovskaia was the one running show.\n\nMorris, who followed Lampard when he made the switch from Derby County to Stamford Bridge, opened up on their communication issues on the All Out Football podcast.\n\nHe said: “(Lampard) never had one conversation with Roman (Abramovich) the whole time he was there.\n\n“The whole time when we went back there, Marina was running the club.\n\n\n\nSUN VEGAS WELCOME OFFER: GET £50 BONUS WHEN YOU JOIN\n\n“Frank Lampard is the manager of Chelsea and he never had one conversation with Roman as manager.”\n\nReports at the time of Lampard’s dismissal made similar claims, and reiterated Granovskaia’s importance in the club hierarchy.\n\nA stunned Lescott chimed in: “You’re saying that now, I’m thinking’ that’s insane.”\n\n\n\nMorris doubled down, adding: “He had conversations when he played for Chelsea, but then you come back as manager and they didn’t have one conversation, and he wanted to.”\n\nLampard led his side to fourth and an FA Cup final in his first season in the dugout.\n\nBut results took a nosedive in his second term and he was sacked in January 2021.\n\nThe Chelsea Blueprint on YouTube Calling all Chelsea fans - we have a brand new YouTube channel!

However, under current circumstances we believe it is best to change managers.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at the club, the board and personally, I would like to thank Frank for his work as head coach and wish him every success in the future.”"

The 41-year-old Al-Nassr forward announced on Thursday that he had purchased a 25 per cent stake in Spanish club Almeria.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRonaldo has joined a growing group of players to dip into ownership, including fellow current and former Real Madrid alumni Luka Modric, Vinicius Junior, Thibaut Courtois and Kylian Mbappe. He has put his money into Spanish second division side Almeria via CR7 Sports Investments.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It has been a longtime ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch,\" Ronaldo wrote in a statement. \"UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth.

The former Spurs boss will lead the United States of America at their home World Cup this summer, but beyond that campaign, he could be back in the Premier League and has not ruled it out in a recent interview.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino, who managed Spurs between 2014 and 2019, remains hugely popular with the fanbase and is one of several big names linked with the job on a permanent basis. The club are currently in crisis and battling relegation, with former Juventus manager Igor Tudor taking over as interim manager following Thomas Frank's axing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPochettino is set to lead the USA at this summer's World Cup but has refused to rule out a return to his old club, hinting that he's open to all offers.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring a radio interview with “Radiogaceta de los Deportes” on RNE in Spain, he said: “I’m always linked (to clubs), to Tottenham, just like at one time I was linked to Espanyol, or to other clubs. In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren’t going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, ‘Well, with Mauricio we played good football,’ or whatever it may be.\n\n\"But no.

They also reached the Champions League final in 2019, but lost to Liverpool.\n\nPochettino was sacked just months after that showpiece clash with Spurs appointing Jose Mourinho as his replacement.

Their European Club Finance and Investment Landscape assessment has also highlighted the financial dominance of the Premier League in comparison to other major divisions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat was particularly evidenced by the increase in television revenue to £1.3bn (€1.5b) for English clubs. That staggering figure very nearly amounted to the £1.4bn (€1.6bn) that 53 other European top-division leagues received combined.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite taking a share of that major financial boost, United's specific failures have also been exposed by UEFA, with £692million emerging as their net spend on transfers between 2021 and 2025.

England's financial dominance has also been demonstrated on the pitch with six teams in the last-16 of this season's Champions League.\n\nFor UEFA to publish their findings, an examination of financial accounts from 2021 to 2025 was conducted. This meant the impact of all transfer activity across the five years was included, encompassing profits on sale, amortisation from earlier transfers and impairments.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the report, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: \"After a decade that included one of the toughest periods our sport and our society have faced, European football has come through in a strong position. Club revenues have grown steadily across the board, and top-division income is expected to pass €30bn in the 2025 financial year.\"\n\nThere have been some financial bright spots for United lately, though, with their most recent accounts revealing an operating profit of £32.6million recorded for the opening six months of the fiscal year.\n\nCompared to the £3.9m loss reported during the equivalent period in the previous year, that represents quite the uplift with those improvements fuelled by strategic cost-management measures authorised by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt appeared to be a difficult financial period for United without the inclusion of European football and the substantial funding that accompanies it, but evidently, that has not been the case.\n\nThere has, however, been a predictable decline in commercial and matchday revenue due to fewer fixtures, with the club just over £9million down.\n\nView 2 Images Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada issued an update after the release of the club's latest accounts (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited CEO Omar Berrada stated: \"We are now seeing the positive financial impact of our off-pitch transformation materialise both in our costs and profitability.

Manchester United confirmed during January that the midfielder will depart when his contract runs out on 30 June.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCasemiro's agreement contains a clause to extend by a further year, but the club have opted not to retain him for a fifth year. With fewer than six months left on his existing contract, the Brazil international can negotiate a pre-contract arrangement with clubs beyond England.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNo agreement has yet emerged publicly. However, Casemiro is understood to be eager to remain in Europe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nThe Sun reports sources close to the player have suggested Italy represents a possible destination. They point to his former Real Madrid teammate Luka Modric and his transfer to AC Milan last summer as a precedent.\n\nCasemiro is six-and-a-half years younger than the 2018 Ballon d'Or recipient, who celebrated his 40th birthday in September. He has also devoted the past 13 years of his career to playing European football since departing Sao Paulo in January 2013, initially on loan, for Madrid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeculation regarding a switch to Italy comes after former United striker Dion Dublin's appeal for Casemiro to remain. He told OLBG that United ought to allocate some of their transfer funds to offer him fresh terms.\n\nView 2 Images Casemiro could follow Luka Modric to Italy this summer (Image: DeFodi Images, DeFodi Images via Getty Images)\n\nDublin said: \"[Casemiro's] been sort of 75% and he's had his dips where people said, 'oh, his legs are gone, oh, his legs are gone, he can't run around anymore, he can't do this, he can't do that. To be honest with you, I retired at 39; my legs went about 33.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If you can do your job and you're clever with it, then I think you'll have a long time in the game. I retired at 39, so I knew how to manage my body.\n\n\"The managers that I had knew how to manage me,' just do two or three days of training, that's fine,' because they knew what they'd get on a match day. I think it's the same with Casemiro.\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"His footballing brain and knowledge are just outstanding. If you watch Casemiro, who tries to play a pass and it gets cut out, and then the other team go and breaks, and they might have had a chance, but if that pass comes up again, he'll try it again.\n\n\"I just think you have to try and find somebody when he goes, that's as brave as him, as clever as him, and as Man United as him, to be honest with you, because he's loved it. Absolutely, I like watching him play.\"\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "Nottingham Forest survived a scare from Fenerbahce to book their Europa League last-16 place, winning 4-2 on aggregate despite a 2-1 defeat at the City ground in Thursday's second leg.\n\nVitor Pereira had the luxury of rotation for the knockout play-off tie, having already won 3-0 in Istanbul last week, but the difference in performances could not have been more vast.\n\nForest were the architects of their own difficulties too, and made a seemingly simple task monumentally harder.\n\nThey were first punished in the 22nd minute when Fenerbahce's ruthless break saw Kerem Akturkoglu sweep home to hand the visitors a lifeline.\n\nIt gave Fenerbahce real confidence, with Akturkoglu and Sidiki Cherif squandering glorious chances to level up the tie in the first half.\n\nImage: The game was stopped mere seconds after kick-off after Fenerbahce fans threw flares onto the pitch\n\nForest players forced to dodge Fenerbahce fireworks Forest players were forced to dodge fireworks thrown on to the pitch by Fenerbahce fans.\n\n\n\nMoments after the match kicked off, there was a three-minute delay as sections of a 1,500-strong away end launched several fireworks on to the pitch into the Forest penalty area.\n\n\n\nJair Cunha had to take evasive action as he had his back to them and Neco Williams also had to duck as he tried to carry one away.\n\n\n\nFenerbahce's Archie Brown also had to intervene and carry some of the pyrotechnics off the pitch while urging calm from his side’s fans.\n\nAfter 45 minutes with no shots on target, high turnovers and losing duels, Pereira made four half-time changes - something he called \"difficult\" after the game - bringing on Callum Hudson-Odoi, Igor Jesus, Ola Aina and Ibrahim Sangare.\n\nBut seconds into the second half, another clumsy moment handed Fenerbahce a penalty. Jair Cunha stuck a foot out to catch Akturkoglu and, after a VAR check, the on-field decision stood.\n\nImage: Fenerbahce's Kerem Akturkoglu scores his opener against Nottingham Forest\n\nIt was the forward who stepped up and easily slotted home his second of the evening to give the Turkish side real hope of levelling up on aggregate.\n\nBut Forest soon settled into their rhythm as the substitutes worked their magic, even if the approach of careful possession - as they have done so well in their two games under Pereira so far - did little to calm the nerves of the home fans.\n\nImage: Nottingham Forest's Callum Hudson-Odoi scored at the City Ground on Thursday\n\nAnd as the unhappy whistles began, Forest answered. It was two substitutes who combined as Aina's swinging cross found Hudson-Odoi over on the left of the area. He then sped past his defender before hammering home his first European goal of the season into the far corner.\n\nThe relief was palpable around the City Ground, and it took the remaining puff out of injury-hit Fenerbahce. Forest are now in the draw for Friday's last-16 draw, and will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland.\n\nTeam news headlines Only five Nottingham Forest players survived from the weekend's 1-0 defeat to Liverpool - those were Stefan Ortega, Murillo, Neco Williams, Elliot Anderson and Omari Hutchinson.\n\nFenerbache have an injury-hit squad, and only named five outfield players on their bench. The likes of Ederson and Milan Skriniar were among the absentees.\n\nPereira: Changing six players was a risk\n\nNottingham Forest head coach Vitor Pereira: \"When you change half of a team, it's not easy to keep the level, that's my responsibility because we have an important game in three days. By my decision, I try to manage the next game and recover some players. It's not easy. It will change a lot.\n\n\"We are in the moment of the season that we need to think not about one game, but about two games, about the next game. It was a risk because I decided to make six changes in the team. If you have one or two changes the players can be in the middle of the others, and you don't miss the quality.\n\n\"But when you change six players they aren't used to playing 90 minutes. This is the risk and I decide to take this risk. I decide because I need to think about the Brighton game, because it's very important for us. We need to go there with fuel and energy.\n\n\"We conceded a goal and lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at half-time, but I said to the players it's my decision. The game was a dangerous situation for us. They start the second half by scoring the second goal and after we start to play and create.\n\n\"We have a big chance to score the second goal. Ok, this is important to keep in our mind. I know they came here to fight for the result.\"\n\nOn learnings: \"Even for me. If you change five players you don't know what will happen. When the pressure starts to come, under stress it's difficult to be themselves when you don't play every match. In the end, we are in the competition so let's move forward and think about Brighton.\"\n\nVitor Pereira has become the second Nottingham Forest manager this season to lose his first two home games in charge, along with Ange Postecoglou. He's now lost four in a row at home in all competitions (also his last two at Wolves), his worst-ever run as a manager.\n\nHudson-Odoi: We made it difficult for ourselves\n\nImage: Hudson-Odoi scored his first European goal of the season against Fenerbahce\n\nNottingham Forest goalscorer Callum Hudson-Odoi to TNT Sports: \"We made it difficult for ourselves. When you're in the lead and sometimes you can feel a bit comfortable, but we showed a great reaction after they scored the second goal.\n\n\"We wanted to score, which we did.

            "content": "Evann Guessand scored again late on as under-pressure Oliver Glasner watched his Crystal Palace side beat Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to secure a 3-1 aggregate win in the UEFA Conference League and secure passage into the last 16.\n\nAlong with the help of a Maxence Lacroix header Palace now look forward to Friday's draw, where they will find out whether they take on Mainz or AEK Larnaca in the next round.\n\nBack-to-back wins for Palace for the first time since December should guarantee that Glasner remains in position for Palace's trip to Manchester United this weekend after he fanned the flames of speculation around a premature exit this week.\n\nPalace laboured in the early exchanges as they looked to open the scoring and Lacroix's 36th-minute header, teed up by a superb Adam Wharton ball from a set-piece, was their only effort on target in the first period. The goal, though, lifted an otherwise lacklustre Selhurst atmosphere with spots of empty seats reflective of a collective apathy in south London.\n\nPlayer ratings: Crystal Palace: Henderson (6), Munoz (6), Lacroix (7), Richards (6), Canvot (6), Mitchell (6), Wharton (8), Kamada (7), Sarr (6), Guessand (8), Strand Larsen (6)\n\n\n\nSubs: Hughes (6), Johnson (6)\n\n\n\nPlayer of the Match: Wharton\n\nWhile quality was lacking, Palace continued to push a Zrinjski side who had failed to score and therefore win in any of their Conference League games away from home this season.\n\nIsmaila Sarr was denied by opposition goalkeeper Goran Karacic in a one on one as he spurned one of his several chances, as Palace's endeavour proved more than their quality as the game wore on.\n\nHowever, after Tomi Juric had Palace hearts in their mouths late on as he sent a header wide, Guessand ran through and wrapped up the victory in injury time.\n\nWhat's happening in Friday's draw?\n\nThe Conference League last-16 draw will take place on Friday at 1pm UK time in Nyon, Switzerland.\n\nThe draw will confirm the last-16 ties and also allocate a side of the bracket for every team so they know who they could potentially meet in the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.\n\nEach of the play-off winners face the sides that finished in the top eight (seeded teams) in the league phase.\n\nPalace will play the second leg of the tie against either Larnaca or Mainz away from home.\n\nGlasner: I've been given assurance of staying but sometimes we don't enjoy the noise\n\nCrystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner played down suggestions of a premature Selhurst Park exit but says he has not enjoyed the backlash during his side's difficult spell.\n\nSpeaking to TNT Sports, he said: \"I've had 100-per-cent assurance [of staying on]. For me, the number one is the players, the players believing in the staff and I - and that's the most important thing, otherwise you can pack your suitcase and go home.\n\n\"They have a great togetherness in the group, the staff and it's the same with the chairman and sporting director.\n\n\"They are sometimes wondering - it's the second-best Premier League season ever.\n\n\"The best was last year, so maybe the best two in Palace's history, playing European football for the first time, and there is so much noise so sometimes we really don't understand it.\n\n\"Maybe I gave some interviews which were not really helpful, I have to admit, but I always say what I am feeling and sometimes it's positive, sometimes it's not so positive.\n\n\"That's Oliver Glasner, and in the end, we are in a very good position in the league and now it's up to us with our fans to make a really good season of it.\"\n\nStimac: Palace are my favourites to win the Conference League!\n\nZrinjski Mostar boss Igor Stimac says Crystal Palace are his pick to go on and win the Conference League.\n\n\"Congratulations to Crystal Palace,\" he said.\n\n\"Looking at the teams which are left there. As far as I'm concerned, they are one of the top three favourites in this competition. I wish them the best of luck to win the competition and to go all the way through.\"\n\nQuizzed further on who his top three are, Simac added: \"Crystal Palace is my favourite. Mainz is the second one. I would say we played against them already. And they have an enormous quality in their team also. They have wonderful support and a really, really well-balanced team. Dangerous from each part, each position.\""

            "content": "Celtic salvaged some pride despite exiting the Europa League at the hands of Stuttgart 4-2 on aggregate as Luke McCowan's first-minute strike earned them a first-ever victory in Germany.\n\nTrailing by three goals from the first leg and needing a minor miracle to progress to the last 16, Martin O'Neill decided to rest eight first-teamers against a side fourth in the Bundesliga ahead of a crunch Old Firm game on Sunday, live on Sky Sports.\n\nO'Neill's players did not share his apparent willingness to throw in the towel and stunned the MHPArena with just 28 seconds on the clock as Junior Adamu's slide-rule pass was fired home by McCowan for his first European goal.\n\nCeltic could have had a second when Daizen Maeda got the ball stuck under his feet from an Adamu cross with the home side struggling to settle.\n\nBut once they did settle, there were few signs of an unlikely comeback and stand-in goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo, making his European debut for the Hoops, made a number of saves to keep the visitors ahead on the night.\n\nThe one time the Finnish stopper was beaten by Deniz Undav, VAR intervened to rule Ermedin Demirovic offside in the build-up and keep Celtic's lead alive and avoid a moment of potential controversy for the fourth official, who had let Demirovic back onto the pitch following an injury moments before receiving the ball.\n\nFollowing a first-leg hammering and an equally disappointing home defeat by Hibs at the weekend, Celtic's narrow win provided a tonic for their delighted travelling support as they bowed out of Europe with a victory, and joined Bayern Munich as the only opposition sides to win in Stuttgart so far this season.\n\nO'Neill given 'food for thought' ahead of Old Firm game\n\nO'Neill admitted he was handed some selection dilemmas ahead of Sunday's showdown with Rangers after goalkeeper Sinisalo shone and a much-changed side secured the historic if academic win over Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo made six saves in his sixth Celtic appearance of the season and several of them were impressive stops.\n\nThe 24-year-old Finland international looked assured throughout and put pressure on Kasper Schmeichel for a place at Ibrox after some inconsistent displays from the Dane in recent months.\n\nO'Neill said: \"I thought he did really well, really well, in the game. I'm delighted for him, he's a lovely lad.\n\n\"Everybody did well in the match. It gives me food for thought. Of course it does, absolutely.\n\n\"It's not as if we've played some 16-year-olds. The players have all played, but some have played less football than others in recent times.\n\n\"I thought everybody came out with flying colours.\"\n\nO'Neill admitted McCowan's early strike had him believing they could pull off a famous comeback.\n\nImage: McCowan was all smiles after scoring\n\n\"I'm delighted with the effort and determination they put into the game,\" added the Celtic manager.\n\n\"We got off to a really great start. We felt as if we don't concede in the first 20 minutes of the match, and maybe even nick a goal, we could still be in the tie.\n\n\"I got carried away with myself [after the goal]. I thought, we're going to do this here. Eventually, we have to create more chances and it wasn't to be.\n\n\"It might have been interesting if Seb (Tounekti) had scored towards the last couple of minutes. It might have been a bit nervy for Stuttgart.\n\n\"I genuinely thought we could do it, but I might be asking a lot.\n\n\"We're playing a very, very good side. A side, from my viewpoint here, capable of winning the competition.\n\n\"But I couldn't be more pleased with the team, couldn't be more pleased with attitude and desire.\""

The referee responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and temporarily stopping the match.\n\nUEFA has opened an investigation into allegations of \"discriminatory behaviour\" after the game in Lisbon, and Prestianni was handed a one-match suspension, covering the second leg at the Bernabeu.\n\nBenfica appealed the temporary suspension, and Prestianni did travel and train with the squad in Madrid. However, the appeal was dismissed hours before the game on Wednesday.\n\nReal Madrid won the tie 3-1 on aggregate to seal a spot on the last 16. Aurelien Tchouameni said the result was a \"victory for everyone who stands against racism\".\n\nImage: Gianluca Prestianni arrives in Madrid with the Benfica squad (credit Benfica)\n\nMourinho criticised for response over incident\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho did not speak to the media around Wednesday's second leg, with his sending off during the first leg meaning he did not have to carry out his usual media duties.\n\nIt comes after the former Real Madrid boss was widely criticised for appearing to defend Prestianni and the club by questioning the way Vinicius Jr celebrates goals.\n\n\"I told him, when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. They [Vinicius Jr and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent,\" Mourinho told Amazon Prime following the first leg.\n\n\"When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.\"\n\nImage: Mourinho spoke to Vinicius Jr after the incident in the Champions League knockout round play-off first leg\n\nMourinho then appeared to comment on previous incidents in which Vinicius Jr has been subject to racist abuse in stadiums.\n\nThe Brazilian has spoken out multiple times against racism he has been subject to inside stadiums. In June 2024, three Valencia fans were jailed for eight months for racially abusing him during a LaLiga game the previous year, in the first verdict of its kind in Spain.\n\n\"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,\" said Mourinho. \"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking to a visibly upset Vinicius Jr and a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card during the lengthy stoppage. After a number of discussions between players, coaches and the referee, play then resumed.\n\nReal Madrid held on to win but there was a further short delay late in stoppage time when fans threw objects as Vinicius Jr was attempting to take a corner kick.\n\nImage: Vinicius Junior scored against Benfica in the second leg to round off Real Madrid's win\n\n'Prestianni facing 10-game ban'\n\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\n\nUEFA has moved very quickly to suspend Prestianni. They appointed an ethics inspector last Wednesday to look into allegations that Prestianni had racially abused Vinicius Jr the previous evening.\n\nThe inspector has already spoken to the relevant parties and forwarded an interim report to UEFA's disciplinary body, recommending Prestianni is suspended for one game while the disciplinary process continues.\n\nThe inspector believes there is prima facie evidence that Prestianni has broken UEFA's regulations on discriminatory behaviour, which carries a minimum 10-game ban.\n\nUEFA says the provisional ban is without prejudice, which means Prestianni can still expect a fair hearing.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Aurélien Tchouaméni praised Vinícius Júnior for his performance against Benfica, after the forward was allegedly subjected to racial abuse during the first leg of their Champions League play-off clash.\n\nVinicius Jr: Racists are cowards\n\nPosting after the first leg, in Portuguese on his Instagram story, Vinicius Jr wrote: \"Racists are, above all, cowards.\n\n\"They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.\n\n\"But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened here today was new in my life and my family's.\n\n\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\n\n\"I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\n\nImage: Vinicius Jr spoke to referee Francois Letexier after Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni appeared to make a comment towards him\n\nIn a statement in Portuguese on Instagram, shared by Benfica on social media, Prestianni denied making racist comments.\n\nHe wrote: \"I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard.\n\n\"I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.\"\n\nBenfica posted footage of the incident on X, with the comment: \"As the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.\"\n\nMbappe explains what he heard\n\nReal Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe said in an interview after the match in Lisbon that he heard Prestianni racially abuse his team-mate and said the Benfica winger should not be allowed to play in the Champions League.\n\n\"I know everything,\" the France international said after the game. \"I will explain everything that happened.\n\n\"Vinicius scored a goal - an amazing goal. He goes to dance and the people boo him. That's something that happens in football. After that, there's a moment of tension with the Benfica players. It's better if it doesn't happen, but this can happen too.\n\n\"It's the Champions League, the best competition in the world for clubs. So, it's normal that people want to win, to give their best for their club and their fans and defend their colours.\n\n\"After that, Benfica's No 25 - I don't want to say his name because he doesn't deserve it - starts to talk badly. You don't accept it but, again, it happens in football and it will continue to happen.\n\n\"He put his shirt here [over his mouth] to say Vinicius is a ****** five times. I heard it. There are Benfica players who heard it as well. And after that point, everything you have seen started.\n\n\"I want to try and explain it calmly. I don't want to speak in a general manner. I have come to Portugal many times. I have been lucky to have many team-mates and friends from Portugal, and nothing has ever happened to me.\n\n\"With these kind of things, it's very important to speak in a very clear way, and to not speak in general, because there are people who haven't done anything wrong. In the stadium, I think there are 70,000 people who haven't done anything wrong. They just wanted to support their team.\n\n\"I have the maximum respect for Benfica and their manager, who is one of the best in history, who has made history at Real Madrid.\n\n\"But this player, for me, doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing to play in the Champions League. The best competition. Everyone here, all the journalists, loves the Champions League, no? It inspires me as a player, it inspires the people, it inspires children, and we have to give the best possible example to young people.\n\n\"If we let this kind of thing happen, I think all the values of football are worthless, all that we believe is worthless. We have to do something.\"\n\nVinicius Jr's history with incidents of racism\n\nVinicius Jr has spoken out previously about repeated racist abuse he has suffered, saying in 2024 that he felt \"less and less\" like playing football because of the abuse.\n\nIn that same year, three Valencia fans were sentenced to eight months in prison for racially abusing him at a match in May 2023 - in scenes reminiscent of those in Benfica, as the game was also stopped for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr alerted the referee to fans he felt had abused him.\n\nAfter the game, the Brazilian said LaLiga \"belongs to racism\". But LaLiga president Javier Tebas responded that Vinicius Jr had been \"manipulated\" in calling out the abuse. Tebas later apologised for those comments.\n\nThe three supporters from the Valencia incident were also fined €5,000 (£4,681) and banned from sporting venues for one year for making racist gestures. Valencia were fined €27,000 (£23,581) and had their stadium partially closed for three matches.\n\nSince then, Spain has been punishing supporters for racist abuse towards Vinicius Jr. Four people were convicted for hanging an effigy with his name on it off a highway bridge in Madrid earlier in 2023.\n\nThree of them were sentenced to seven months in prison for hate crimes and threats, while the other was sentenced to 15 months in prison for sharing the images online.\n\nAll four had to take an anti-discrimination training programme to have those sentences suspended, while they were also fined €60,000 and banned from sports venues for two years.\n\nAnd just last year, five Real Valladolid fans were found guilty for racially abusing Vinicius Jr during a match in 2022. They faced one year in prison and were fined up to €1,620 (£1,412) - but again the prison sentences were suspended as long as they did not attend a football match for three years."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three away games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on a direct rival. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season.

The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in match-day chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) and sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL translators will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here.

We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland.

Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track following a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croatian’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to firstly avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance.

The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge for the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes following the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate. Agencies Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt was a long first half from a Forest perspective. The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Strand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time.

Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

            "content": "The Premier League is to launch its own streaming service, with live coverage of all 380 matches over a season available directly to fans – but only if you live in Singapore.\n\nKnown as Premier League Plus, the new app will be launched before next season and will be the first time match coverage will be sold direct to consumers.\n\nDescribed by the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, as simply being a “learning” opportunity, the move will still cause shockwaves throughout the game as the world’s biggest domestic football league moves to directly control its revenues without the need for a broadcast partner.\n\n“From next season onward, from August, Premier League Plus is going to happen,” Masters said. “For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

            "content": "A number of European football federations fear they will lose money sending their national teams to the World Cup this summer, with an unusual hike in costs and inconsistencies around tax exemptions among the problems Fifa is being urged to rectify.\n\nAlthough Fifa approved record prize money of £539m for the tournament last December it may not be enough to prevent losses, or reduced profits, for competitors who would usually expect a World Cup to generate vital funds. An investigation by the Guardian and PA Media found particular concerns among football associations about the consequences of missing out on money that would largely be reinvested in local initiatives.\n\nAbout 10 FAs are understood to have shared misgivings between themselves, most recently at Uefa’s annual congress in Brussels a fortnight ago. It has also been informally raised with senior Fifa officials, some of whom appear “embarrassed” about the situation according to an executive from one FA.\n\nTeams that qualify receive $9m (£6.7m) each from Fifa and are handed $1.5m in preparation costs. Those numbers are believed to have been the same for Qatar 2022, but the previous daily allowance of $850 per delegation member has been reduced to $600. One FA estimated that this would mean receiving about $500,000 less if its team remained at the World Cup, which has been expanded in length and number, for a month.\n\nSome FAs have calculated that they will make considerably less money in the US, Canada and Mexico than they did in Qatar; one, a fixture at international tournaments, told the Guardian it will in fact lose a sizeable sum in the event of elimination in the group stage or early in the knockout rounds.\n\nOne particularly aggravating element is a perceived unfairness around tax arrangements. Countries bidding for a World Cup are obliged to provide tax exemptions for FAs that qualify; those have been agreed with Canada and Mexico but no such arrangement has been reached with the US, meaning that nations potentially face vastly differing financial outlooks depending on where they were drawn to play.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Qatar World Cup cost less and was more lucrative for teams, with clear tax arrangements. Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPA\n\nState taxes within the US vary wildly. In California, where Los Angeles and San Francisco will host games, the top rate is 13.3%. In New Jersey, whose MetLife Stadium will stage the final, it stands at 10.75%. Teams largely based in states with lower rates, or outside the US, will find themselves at an advantage financially unless an agreement is reached in the next three and a half months. Given that context, there is also frustration that FAs have been left to seek their own tax advice rather than being given specific assistance by Fifa.\n\nOther factors hiking costs include the tournament’s considerable travel demands, unfavourable exchange rates against the dollar, the well-publicised increase in ticket prices and the event’s duration. In Qatar there were four weeks between the opening game and final; this time around the 28-day mark will arrive as the quarter-finals commence.\n\nWhile some figures acknowledge that FAs are responsible for their own bonus structures, which inevitably make for a notable outlay, they point out it would be unworkable to offer a reduced package to that which was promised to their squads in Qatar. Another mitigation offered for this summer’s problems is the potential longer-term benefit of lengthy exposure to the vast North American market. Fifa was contacted for comment."

            "content": "'SERIOUS QUESTIONS' Nigel Farage slams ‘deeply concerning levels’ of family voting in crunch by-election after volunteer report\n\nNIGEL FARAGE has blasted “deeply concerning” levels of family voting in a crunch by-election following the release of a volunteer report.\n\nPolling stations slammed shut in Gorton and Denton at 10pm on Thursday with the ballot coming down to a tight three-horse race between Reform UK, Labour and the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Nigel Farage has said a report of high levels of family voting in the Gorton and Denton by-election “raises serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas”.\n\nThe leader of Reform UK said on X: “Incidents of family voting in Gorton & Denton reached the highest levels of any election in the past 10 years.\n\n“This is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas.”\n\n\n\nFamily voting is an illegal practice where two voters either confer, collude or direct each other on voting and can involve husbands telling their wives how to vote.\n\nIt comes as an election observer group has raised concerns over “concerningly high levels of family voting”.\n\nDemocracy Volunteers said they attended 22 of the 45 polling stations in the constituency, spending 30 to 45 minutes in each, and witnessed family voting in 15 of the 22 polling stations observed.\n\nThe group said they observed a sample of 545 individuals casting their vote and saw 32 cases of family voting in total, including nine cases in one polling station.\n\n\n\nFarage’s concerns were in response to a post from Sky News on the group’s report into family voting in the by-election.\n\nAccording to the post, the Electoral Commission gives Democracy Volunteers access to polling stations and only they and the police are permitted to enter.\n\nBut while the Reform UK leader has questioned the process in “predominantly Muslim areas” the group has not specified who has taken part in the illegal practice.\n\nDirector of Democracy Volunteers, John Ault, said on Thursday night: “Today we have seen concerningly high levels of family voting in Gorton and Denton.\n\n“Based on our assessment of today’s observations, we have seen the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10-year history of observing elections in the UK.\n\n\n\n“We rarely issue a report on the night of an election, but the data we have collected today on family voting, when compared to other recent by-elections, is extremely high.\n\n“In the other recent Westminster parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby, we saw family voting in 12% of polling stations, affecting 1% of voters.\n\n“In Gorton and Denton, we observed family voting in 68% of polling stations, affecting 12% of those voters observed.”\n\n\n\nA leading pollster has also said he intends to raise serious concerns about voting in the by-election, The Independent reports.\n\nManchester City Council has also criticised Democracy Volunteers for not flagging their concerns earlier on Thursday.\n\nA spokesperson for the acting returning officer at the by-election said in a statement: “Polling station staff are trained to look out for any evidence of undue influence on voters. No such issues have been reported today.\n\n“If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken.\n\n“We have operated a central by-election hub which has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police – who had a presence at every polling station – where necessary.\n\n\n\n“It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThe Prime Minister’s chances of staying in Downing Street rest on the crucial vote with the seat seen as a three-way tie between Labour, Reform and the Greens.\n\nPolling stations opened at 7am on Thursday and closed at 10pm."

Never Again Fascism.”\n\nAfter the dictator’s 1945 suicide, the Pommer family took over the deed.\n\nSince 1972, the Austrian Ministry of the Interior began leasing the house to protect it from misuse by Neo-Nazis.\n\n\n\nIt has taken on different lives as a city library, a school, and later a disability workshop centre.\n\nThe house stood derelict from 2011 to 2016, but became state property a year later, with the owner reportedly receiving a handsome £700,000 sum.\n\nAuthor Ludwig Laher, a member of the Mauthausen Committee Austria that represents Holocaust victims, blasted the costly conversion.\n\n\n\n“A police station is problematic, as the police… are obliged, in every political system, to protect what the state wants,” he said.\n\nAccording to Laher, a previous idea to turn it into a place where people could discuss peace had received a lot of support.\n\nJasmin Stadler, a 34-year-old shop owner and Braunau native, also slammed the eye-watering money paid.\n\nShe added it would have been interesting to put Hitler’s birth in the house in a “historic context”.\n\nBut others showed support for the redesign.\n\n\n\nWolfgang Leitner, a 57-year-old electrical engineer, said turning it into a police station could help “bring, hopefully, a bit of calm”\n\n“It makes sense to use the building and give it to the police, to the public authorities,” he said.\n\nIt comes as a bonkers 41-year-old neo-Nazi got nicked for hoarding drugs, weapons and Hitler-themed wine in Pinsdorf, an hour south of the Hitler home.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThroughout Austria, debate on how to address the country’s Holocaust history has repeatedly flared.\n\nSome 65,000 Austrian Jews were killed and 130,000 forced into exile during Nazi rule."

It must have been doing faster than 40mph.”\n\nMoments later, the same witness came across the aftermath.\n\nThey added: “As I drove on I saw smoke and mist in the road and then saw bits of car and realised something had happened.”\n\n\n\nMedical tests later found no evidence of drugs or alcohol in Louie’s system.\n\nThe court heard he had left a “note of intention”, with the coroner recording a conclusion of suicide.\n\nMs Brown concluded: “Louie Day from Brentwood died on September 5, 2025, on the A414 near King Street due to multiple injuries (head, chest and abdomen) sustained as a result of a road traffic collision as the driver and only occupant, leaving a note of intent.\n\n“The conclusion is one of suicide.”\n\nLouie had been training with the Metropolitan Police at the time and was working as a response officer on the East Area Command, based in Barking and Dagenham. He had previously served for two years as a PCSO.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn a heartbreaking statement, Louie’s family said: “It is with the greatest sadness that we announce the passing of our son, Louie Day, a beautiful soul who has left this world and will be greatly missed by all who loved him.\n\n“We would now like some privacy to grieve in peace.”"

Later in life, the virus may then reawaken, causing a different illness with several uncomfortable symptoms.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn X, formerly Twitter, the UKHSA said: \"If you've had chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in your body and can reactivate later in life, causing shingles. If you or someone you know is 65 or over, read our blog post to find out how to get protected against this painful condition.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChickenpox is a common infection that mostly affects children. Symptoms may include a high temperature, aches, and a loss of appetite, followed by the appearance of small red or pink spots anywhere on the body.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nAlthough most cases improve on their own within one to two weeks, the varicella-zoster virus that causes it may then remain dormant in the body. After several years, one in three adults will develop shingles when this virus reactivates.\n\nThe first signs of shingles often include tingling or pain in an area of skin, along with headaches. Typically, a rash develops a few days afterwards, usually on the chest and stomach, but it can appear anywhere.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOfficial NHS advice explains: \"Try to see a pharmacist within three days of the rash appearing. If you need medicine, it can help to speed up your recovery and avoid longer-lasting problems. A pharmacist can give the same antiviral medicines as a GP. They can also give advice or direct you to other medical help, if needed.\"\n\nThe NHS offers a shingles vaccine to all adults turning 64, those aged 70 to 79 and others over 18 with severely weakened immune systems. For the latter category, this generally includes the following people:\n\nSome people with blood cancer (such as leukaemia or lymphoma)\n\nSome people with HIV or AIDS\n\nSome people who've recently had a stem cell transplant, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or an organ transplant\n\nPeople taking certain medicines that severely weaken the immune system\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile most eligible people can have the shingles vaccine, it is unsuitable for those who have had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine or to an ingredient in the vaccine.\n\nThe NHS adds: \" Your GP surgery will usually contact you when you become eligible for the shingles vaccine. This will usually be by letter, text message, phone or email. Sometimes you might be offered the vaccine during a GP appointment you're having for another reason.\"\n\nFor more information, visit the NHS website here.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Chickenpox is a common infection that mostly affects children (Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nSymptoms of chickenpox\n\nA high temperature\n\nAches and pains, and generally feel unwell\n\nLoss of appetite\n\nRed spots that become blisters and then scabs\n\nSymptoms of shingles\n\nA tingling or painful feeling in an area of skin\n\nA headache or feeling generally unwell\n\nRash appearing a few days later\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

(Image: Getty)\n\nIf you've been stashing away Pokémon cards since childhood or building a collection as an adult, you could be sitting on a small fortune - provided you're willing to part with them. Fresh research has analysed the worth of Pokémon cards across the board, identifying which ones might earn you a tidy windfall.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to findings from CSGOLuck, Charizard cards reign supreme in terms of value, with particular editions commanding prices up to £16,000. A CSGOLuck spokesperson said: \"Whilst it will come as no surprise to fans of the franchise that Charizard ranked first, it's astonishing to see just how much more valuable the character's cards were in comparison to others.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"The fact that the face of the franchise, Pikachu, has over triple the number of cards in circulation than Charizard demonstrates just how popular and iconic the fire-breathing Pokémon is.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFor anyone looking to determine what their cards might be worth, one resourceful Redditor shared this advice: \"Each card is from a specific set. You can most easily identify your card by typing in the name of the card and the set number which is found in the lower left or lower right corner of a card.\".\n\n\"For example, a base set Charizard holo is 4/102 - if I didn't know this card was from base set I would simply search 'Charizard 4/102'. If you have base set cards, there is a chance they are first edition, shadowless, or unlimited.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDo you have any of the following?\n\n1. Charizard\n\nThe undisputed champion Charizard dominates the Pokémon card market with an impressive total card value of $21,468.91 (£16,000). The character's iconic status makes each card a prized possession to collectors, but the values of its 62 cards vary dramatically, ranging from $2.86 to an astonishing $7,182.99 (£5,300).\n\n2. Pikachu\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAs the face of Pokémon, Pikachu commands a substantial presence in the card market. With a diverse range of 196 cards across the various sets, Pikachu's total card value stands at $8,356.70 (£6,200), reflecting its widespread popularity. The value of cards can reach as high as $3,809.73 (£2,800).\n\n3. Gengar\n\nThe extremely popular and mischievous ghost-type Pokémon holds third position, with a total card value of $4,277.89 (£3,200). Its 56 cards exhibit values ranging from $0.50 (37p) to $1,103.30 (£800), showcasing the appeal of this spooky yet beloved franchise character.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n4. Espeon Star\n\nWith only one card in existence, Espeon Star is the definition of a rarity. Collectors lucky enough to possess the card won’t be surprised to know it’s extremely valuable, worth $4,122.50 (£3,000).\n\n5. Tropical Beach\n\n‌\n\n\n\nTropical Beach boasts a collective value of $3,883.11 (£2,900), ranging from $15.75 (£11.68) to $1,984.38 (£1,400), depending on the condition of the card and which collection it belongs to. There are just 18 different iterations of this card across all Pokémon card collections, making it a prized asset for any franchise enthusiast.\n\n6. Ho-Oh\n\nHo-Oh, with 23 cards, has a cumulative value of $3,696.75 (£2,700) across all sets and collections. The majestic legendary bird Pokémon was introduced way back in generation two of the franchise, commanding card values anywhere from $0.41 (30p) to $158.75 (£118), offering a range of options for collectors.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n7. Lugia\n\nLugia, the guardian of the seas, holds a total card value of $3,614.78 (£2,700). With 30 different types of cards in circulation, Lugia's values range from $0.45 (33p) to $2,617.25 (£1,900), making it a prized addition to any collection.\n\n8. Celebi\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWith a total value of $3,452.25 (£2,500), Celebi's 25 cards showcase a range of $0.27 (20p) to $1,575.00 (£1,100). The mythical Pokémon comes from the future, boasting the ability to naturally cure when switched out.\n\n9. Champions Festival\n\nRepresenting the pinnacle of Pokémon events, Champions Festival cards have a collective value of $2,480.18 (£1,800). Ranging from $15 (£11.12) to $474.23 (£350), only 30 types are in circulation across the different collections of Pokémon cards.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n10. Umbreon\n\nUmbreon, the Dark-type Pokémon introduced to the franchise in generation two, gains its mysterious powers from the moonlight. The 42 cards range in value from $0.54 (40p) to $520.57 (£380), accumulating a total card value of $2,282.04 (£1,700) across all collections.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

On the panel, from the government, the culture secretary Lisa Nandy; the Conservatives’ shadow home office minister, Alicia Kearns; Jess Brown-Fuller MP from the Liberal Democrats ; the chef and television presenter Tom Kerridge and the journalist Esther Krakue.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring the episode a debate on the royal family and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor caused the crowd to erupt into laughter.

            "content": "Cancer risk increased by 30% by these diets, Oxford University study reveals\n\nOxford University carried out the biggest ever study of its kind which analysed diets of 1.7 million people and identified which ones increase the risk of some cancers by up to 30%\n\nView 2 Images Experts recommend a diet with plenty of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and sources of protein (Image: Getty Images)\n\nA vegetarian diet can slash the risk of five cancers by almost a third, a huge global study suggests.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOxford University researchers found veggies have a 21% lower risk of pancreatic cancer and a 9% lower risk of breast cancer compared with meat eaters. They also have a 12% reduced risk of prostate cancer, 28% lower risk of kidney cancer and 31% lower risk of the blood cancer multiple myeloma. However vegans had a higher risk of bowel cancer.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe new research, published in the British Journal of Cancer, included data from numerous studies across the world, with most participants from the UK and US. Some 1.64 million meat eaters were included, alongside 57,016 poultry eaters who ate no red meat, 42,910 people who ate fish and no meat known as pescatarians, 63,147 vegetarians and 8,849 vegans.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Veggies are less likely to get a number of cancers than meat eaters\n\nCancer breakthrough linked to boosting patients' diets with vegetables and bacteria READ MORE :\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\nAurora Perez Cornago, principal investigator of the study, said: \"Vegetarians typically consume more fruit, vegetables and fibre than meat eaters and no processed meat, which may contribute to lower risks of some cancers.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt is already known that eating processed meat such as ham, bacon and salami is linked to an increased risk of bowel cancer, and possibly stomach cancer. Red meat such as beef, pork and lamb also increases the risk, while white meat, such as chicken and turkey, has not shown a link.\n\nCo-investigator Tim Key, emeritus professor of epidemiology at Oxford Population Health, said there are around three million vegetarians in the UK and interest \"in vegetarianism growing in many parts of the world\". He said that, although it is true that vegetarians do eat more fibre and more fruit and vegetables, the differences in the study between the two groups were \"not very big\". Prof Key said: \"My feeling is the differences are more likely to be related to meat itself than to simply vegetarians eating more healthy foods.”\n\nDr Helen Croker, assistant director of research at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: \"To increase your overall protection from cancer, our advice is to build meals around wholegrains, pulses, fruit and vegetables, and avoid processed meat and limit red meat.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe study, funded by the World Cancer Research Fund, investigated 17 different cancers, including those of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, reproductive system, urinary tract, and blood cancer. Diets were assessed using food questionnaires. Factors that may influence the results, such as body mass index, were taken into account.\n\nWhen looking at vegans, researchers found they had a significantly higher risk of bowel cancer when compared with meat eaters. They said this may be due to a low average intake of calcium compared with other people - 590 milligrams per day compared to a recommendation of 700 milligrams per day - and low intakes of other nutrients.\n\nResearchers did find that vegetarians have nearly double the risk of the most common type of cancer of the oesophagus compared with meat eaters. Aurora Perez Cornago added: \"The higher risk of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in vegetarians and bowel cancer in vegans may relate to lower intakes of certain nutrients more abundant in animal foods.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAmy Hirst, health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: \"When it comes to reducing cancer risk, keeping a healthy, balanced diet overall matters more than individual foods. Aim for plenty of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and sources of protein - as well as cutting down on processed and red meat, alcohol, and foods high in fat, salt and sugar.\""

Democracy Volunteers said it had seen family voting in 12% of polling stations.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFamily voting is an illegal practice where two voters either confer, collude or direct each other on voting and can involve husbands telling their wives how to vote.\n\nWhat is family voting?\n\nLabour Party Chair Anna Turley told BBC Newsnight reports of family voting in the Greater Manchester by-election are “extremely worrying and concerning”. Ms Turley said: “It’s obviously extremely worrying and concerning. That’s not what we want to see in our democracy.\n\nGorton and Denton by-election: Live result as council dismisses family voting claims READ MORE :\n\n“So obviously we need to see the evidence and the report, and then make due decision about what authorities should look into this. But of course it’s worrying to hear that, but we want to see the evidence before proceeding.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNigel Farage seized on the reports and suggested they raised \"serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas\".\n\nExplosive row over family voting claims\n\nThe leader of Reform UK, which is in a tight three-way race with Labour and the Greens, said on X: \"This is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the integrity of the democratic process in predominantly Muslim areas.\"\n\nAnd Reform UK Chair David Bull added: “Electoral fraud is a stain on democracy. We would support reporting it and making sure that it’s done in the spirit and fairness with the law.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGreen Party leader Zack Polanski, who asked if he would like to see the issue referred to authorities, said: “I think it’s important that there’s full transparency about the democratic process, and if the recommendation is that there should be an inquiry or further steps then yes I’d support that.”\n\nDemocracy Volunteers said they attended 22 of the 45 polling stations in the constituency, spending 30 to 45 minutes in each, and witnessed family voting in 15 of the 22 polling stations observed. The group said they observed a sample of 545 individuals casting their vote and saw 32 cases of family voting in total, including nine cases in one polling station.\n\n'No issues' reported\n\nBut a spokesman for the acting returning officer at the by-election slapped down the \"extremely disappointing\" claims. \"Polling station staff are trained to look out for any evidence of undue influence on voters. No such issues have been reported today,\" they said.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If Democracy Volunteers were so concerned about alleged issues they could and should have raised them with us during polling hours so that immediate action could be taken.\n\n\"We have operated a central by-election hub which has been rapidly responding to reported issues during the day, in liaison with the police - who had a presence at every polling station - where necessary. It is extremely disappointing that Democracy Volunteers have waited until after polls have closed to make such claims.\"\n\nJohn Ault, director of Democracy Volunteers, said: \"Today we have seen concerningly high levels of family voting in Gorton and Denton. Based on our assessment of today's observations, we have seen the highest levels of family voting at any election in our 10-year history of observing elections in the UK.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"We rarely issue a report on the night of an election, but the data we have collected today on family voting, when compared to other recent by-elections, is extremely high.\n\n\"In the other recent Westminster parliamentary by-election in Runcorn and Helsby we saw family voting in 12% of polling stations, affecting 1% of voters. In Gorton and Denton, we observed family voting in 68% of polling stations, affecting 12% of those voters observed.\""

On the panel, from the government, the culture secretary Lisa Nandy; the Conservatives’ shadow home office minister, Alicia Kearns; Jess Brown-Fuller MP from the Liberal Democrats; the chef and television presenter Tom Kerridge and the journalist Esther Krakue.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe reform of business rates for hospitality was a hot topic of discussion on tonight's show.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images BBC Question Time was hosted in Birmingham this week (Image: BBC)\n\nAndrew, an audience member, questioned taxes which are set to be imposed on hospitality businesses as of April 2026 after saying his went up 41% last year. He said: \"I have two rurally located pubs, that are the hubs of the village, they're part of the community so they don't just serve food and drink we welcome lonely people, we look after people we work closely with the churches in our village to form part of the community and we seem to be taxed out of existence, whether its NI cost increases of last year or the business rates increases this year it's just becoming impossible to make a profit.\"\n\nHe added: \"My son was going to take over the family business but am I giving him an opportunity to move forward or am I handing him a poisoned chalice?\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Chef Tom Kerridge had his say on the matter (Image: BBC)\n\nTom Kerridge, who owns five restaurants, four of which are pubs, admitted his businesses are under the same pressure as Andrew's. Tom confirmed on average across his four pubs his taxes have gone up 115%.\n\nHe claims a reduction in VAT is the biggest thing to save hospitality, he said: \"at the minute we are squeezing the life out of hospitality and once it's gone it is gone. And if you keep squeezing you'll end up crushing it and it will disappear.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhen asked if reducing VAT is something she would consider by host Fiona Bruce culture secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"We are not afraid to go away and rethink and try and do things differently, we've already done that with this policy but we're hearing it again.\"\n\nStarting from 1 April 2026, pubs in England and Wales will receive a 15% discount on their new business rates bills. This targeted support, announced in January 2026, aims to offset significant tax increases resulting from a 2026 business rates revaluation, which had previously caused widespread concern in the hospitality industry.\n\nNext week on March 5 Question Time returns on BBC One live from Kettering."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

No finder's fee, no compensation,’ Rueda allegedly wrote in an email to his publicists at the time.\n\nManny Pacquiao is suing a law firm and their client for allegedly fabricating a case against him\n\nThe message never came to light despite a judge ordering Rueda’s messages be turned over in 2018, and was only uncovered from a forensic analysis by Pacquiao’s team in 2023.\n\nPacquiao’s lawyers say they traced the gruesome texts of body parts back to a mass-distributed cartel scam.\n\nRecords cited by his new lawsuit allegedly show identical threats were sent to more than 100 other people unconnected to the case.\n\nAfter losing the case, Withers Bergman tried to withdraw as Rueda’s lawyers, and his attorney Amman Khan’s profile was removed from the firm’s website.\n\nOver a decade on from their first encounter, Pacquiao is set for a stunning rematch with Mayweather in Las Vegas later this year.\n\nA Hollywood waiter sued Pacquiao in 2016 after claiming he was owed an $8million fee for helping to arrange his blockbuster May 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather (pictured)\n\nThe fight icons will meet again in September in the first ever boxing match at 'The Sphere' off the strip in Sin City, it was announced earlier this week.\n\nThe bout is set to be globally broadcast on Netflix as part of the streamer's growing investment into live sports.\n\nMayweather, 49, first has to take on Mike Tyson, 59, in an exhibition bout this spring.

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\n\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion.

It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Ruben Amorim and his coaching staff could receive a staggering £15.9million in compensation from Manchester United after they were sacked last month.\n\nAmorim, 41, was axed by United on January 5 after just 14 months in charge at Old Trafford, with his five coaches also departing the club.\n\nDaily Mail Sport revealed he walked away with a £10m pay-off after he was summoned to the club's Carrington training base and dismissed by director of football Jason Wilcox and chief executive Omar Berrada.\n\nA filing to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday revealed removing Amorim and his coaches could cost up to £15.9m.\n\nThe figure stated in the submission is a maximum number, with the exact amount to be determined by factors including whether Amorim lands another job within a certain timeframe.\n\nAmorim's compensation package took the total cost of hiring and firing him to nearly £27m.\n\nRuben Amorim and his coaching staff could net nearly £16m in compensation from United\n\nUnited have spent nearly £30million on the sacking of two managers and one executive in just 15 months\n\nUnited bought out his contract at Sporting Lisbon in October 2024 for £8.3m, and paid another £900,000 so he could start work early. He signed a £6.5m-a-year deal until June 2027, meaning his pay-off for the remainder of his contract is around £10.05m.\n\nThe club had already splashed out £14.5m following the sacking of Erik ten Hag and departure of sporting director Dan Ashworth.\n\nShould they be forced to compensate Amorim and his staff in full, it will take the total United have spent on sacking managers and executives to nearly £30m in just 15 months.\n\nAmorim left United the day after an explosive press conference following the 1-1 draw with Leeds, where he openly criticised club bosses. He clashed with Wilcox in a meeting three days before the trip to Elland Road.\n\nUnited took the decision amid concerns the team could fail to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nAmorim was replaced on an interim basis by Darren Fletcher before the club appointed Michael Carrick, who has won five and drawn one of his six games in charge to boost United's chances of returning to European football's top table.\n\nThe Red Devils are fourth having won the most points - 18 - of any Premier League team this calendar year.\n\nThe top five in the Premier League will secure a Champions League place next season and United are three points clear of Liverpool in sixth.\n\nAmorim won only 25 of his 63 games in charge and finished 15th in the Premier League before losing the Europa League final to Tottenham in May."

            "content": "Crystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar: Oliver Glasner finally finds the formula in Europe with key tactical change - as Eagles unite Selhurst Park despite chaos engulfing the club\n\nRight when they needed them, Crystal Palace's players stepped up as Oliver Glasner's side kept their European dream alive on a huge night at Selhurst Park.\n\nMaxence Lacroix’s first-half header looked to have been decisive for Palace, but after some nervy moments, Evann Guessand confirmed the victory in injury-time to knock out their plucky Bosnian opponents Zrinjski Mostar.\n\n'It was a good and important win,' Glasner said post-match. 'We learned the lessons from the away leg, controlled the game and waited for the moments.\n\n'Not everything is perfect, but we can see the players are feeling better in the way we are playing.'\n\nThere was no doubt this was the biggest night of the Eagles' season given the way their campaign has started to unravel since Glasner announced in January that he would be leaving this summer.\n\n2025-26 had promised so much, but an end to the European journey in February, regardless of the acrimony that has followed the Austrian in recent weeks, would’ve been a disaster.\n\nCrystal Palace dispatched Zrinjski Mostar 2-0 at Selhurst Park to reach the UEFA Conference League last 16\n\nEvann Guessand's 93rd-minute strike followed Maxence Lacroix's first-half header\n\nIt is easy to forget that it is just over two months since Palace, not long off a club record unbeaten run, were in the Carabao Cup quarter-finals and about to enter the FA Cup as holders, but such has been the collapse in their form that this felt enormous.\n\nThat jeopardy was added to by Zrinjski manager Igor Stimac, once of West Ham and Derby.\n\nAt his pre-match press conference, he called out Palace's board for a 'lack of ambition', spoke about their weaknesses, and expressed a desire to add to his own history against the club. Stimac was at Derby when they beat the Eagles to gain promotion to the Premier League in 1996.\n\nYet despite the recent chaos that has engulfed Palace and the breakdown in relationship between the fans and Glasner as a result of his repeated public outbursts, the home supporters roared their side on from before kick-off and this was a night where harmony returned to Selhurst Park.\n\n'I'm always honest,' the Austrian added when pressed on his recent words. 'I can’t do it differently.\n\n'If I feel something I say it and then I have to take the s***storm that follows. Hopefully everybody knows what I'm saying is for the success of Crystal Palace. Tonight the support was great.'\n\nPalace had won just two of their last 16 matches in all competitions heading into this clash - including a dire performance in last week's 1-1 draw in Bosnia - yet the energy and intensity that had been lacking during that run was back in the first half.\n\nMuch of their European campaign has been hampered by a failure to break down low blocks, but here they zipped the ball around and pressed with intent.\n\nIt was also notable how much more direct they were in their play and Jorgen Strand Larsen, Daichi Kamada and Guessand all went close early on.\n\nZrinjski were dogged, and Stimac’s side used all the tricks they could to slow Palace down and frustrate them.\n\nCrystal Palace 2-0 Zrinjski Mostar (3-1 aggregate) Crystal Palace (3-4-2-1): Henderson (C) 7; Richards 7.5, Lacroix 8, Canvot 7.5; Munoz 7, Wharton 7.5 (Hughes 56 7), Kamada 7.5, Mitchell 7; Sarr 7, Guessand 8; Strand Larsen 7 (Johnson 73 6) Subs not used: Benitez (GK), Matthews (GK), Clyne, Sosa, Devenny, Rodney, Riad, Pino, Cardines Manager: Oliver Glasner 7 Yellow cards: Canvot, Strand Larsen, Wharton Goals: Lacroix 36, Guessand 90+3 Referee: Luis Godinho 5\n\nYet it was Adam Wharton, one of many players to have struggled during the recent run, who whipped in a delightful free kick for Lacroix, the unsung hero of this side, to head home powerfully.\n\nThe atmosphere ramped up a notch and the question was whether the Eagles could capitalise, but Glasner’s side squandered a host of opportunities and the tension ramped up.\n\nIt almost cost them when Tomi Juric agonisingly headed wide for Zrinjski in injury time, although that left the stage for Guessand to settle things after good link-up play with Brennan Johnson as Palace secured their passage to the last-16.\n\n\n\n'Crystal Palace deserved to go through,' Stimac said. 'They played better football in both games.'"

            "content": "Vitor Pereira's honeymoon period as Nottingham Forest head coach has lasted precisely 225 minutes. That was all it took for the home fans to show their disgust with their team.\n\nThey may have squeezed through to the Europa League last 16 but in Pereira's third game at the helm, Forest were far from convincing and were booed off at half-time, trailing to Kerem Akturkoglu's strike.\n\n'I took a risk,' admitted Pereira. 'I had to pick this game with one eye on our game at Brighton on Sunday. It's not easy to make six changes but I could not think only about this game. We are not comfortable in the Premier League and it's very important to get points so we can avoid a difficult situation.'\n\nIt threatened to become worse when Akturkoglu converted a penalty early in the second half but by then Pereira had sent on his main men and one of them, Callum Hudson-Odoi, scored in the 68th minute to seal a 4-2 aggregate victory. Forest will face either Real Betis or FC Midtjylland in the next round – even though they took on both clubs in the league phase.\n\nThanks to their 3-0 first-leg win in Istanbul last week, this should have been a comfortable evening for Forest. But like Nuno Espirito Santo, Ange Postecoglou and Sean Dyche before him, Pereira is learning there is a huge gap in quality between Forest's best 13 or 14 players, and the rest of the squad.\n\nPereira made six changes to his starting XI and none of those players are likely to be included for Sunday's crucial Premier League clash on the south coast.\n\nNottingham Forest survived a second leg scare in the Europa League, before Callum Hudson-Odoi's goal gave the Premier League side a 4-2 win on aggregate against Fenerbahce\n\nVitor Pereira's side had earned a 3-0 win in the first leg away from home, all but sealing the tie\n\nBut Kerem Akturkoglu struck in the 22nd minute of the game to make it 3-1 on aggregate\n\nThe Fenerbahce star then netted from the penalty spot after the break to set up a nervy finish\n\nThe travelling Fener fans hurled multiple flares on to the pitch in the first minute, causing a brief stoppage in play. Captain Ismail Yuksek pleaded for calm yet it was Forest who looked jittery.\n\nNerves are one thing, competence is another. When he arrived, Pereira talked about using his whole squad. How does he stick to those words after this? Morato, James McAtee and Lorenzo Lucca looked way out of their depth and Forest were lucky to be only 1-0 down at the interval.\n\nWhen Morato slipped on the halfway line in the 22nd minute, Forest were left two-on-two at the back. Neco Williams failed to cut out Sidiki Cherif's cross, allowing Akturkoglu to steady himself and finish from close range. Trying to respond immediately, Elliot Anderson collected a pass from Omari Hutchinson and fired a fraction wide from a narrow angle.\n\nCherif – twice – and Akturkoglu failed to profit from Forest mistakes and when the whistle went for half-time, the home fans made their feelings known.\n\nForest made four changes at half-time only for Fener to win a penalty within 25 seconds of the restart when Jair Cunha tripped Akturkoglu and the Turkey international converted confidently from the spot. And when Cunha had the chance to make amends soon afterwards, Tarik Cetin saved his effort.\n\nDespite the second goal, the arrival of first-team regulars Ola Aina, Ibrahim Sangare, Igor Jesus and Callum Hudson-Odoi revived Forest a little, and it was Hudson-Odoi who lowered the collective heart rate inside the City Ground when his angled shot from 10 yards crept into the corner midway through the second half. Igor Jesus and Hutchinson then wasted chances to level it on the night as Forest edged through."

            "content": "How Cristiano Ronaldo is preparing for retirement after becoming a club owner with football's first billionaire putting plans in place at age of 41\n\nWhen Cristiano Ronaldo was asked about his future in football in 2023, as a 38-year-old having not long started his venture at Al Nassr, he revealed his plan to one day become the owner of a football club.\n\n'I don't rule out becoming a club owner,' Ronaldo said. 'It's something I thought about a few years back. I probably would like to own a [football] club. I'm at the end of my career, two to three years maximum.'\n\nIt's now been three years.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ronaldo's roadmap to retirement has become clearer, and he has done exactly what he said he would do.\n\nRonaldo's ownership dream has come to fruition: he has purchased a 25 per cent stake in Spanish second-division side UD Almeria through his CR7 Sports Investments company.\n\nThe purchase figure hasn't been disclosed, but it marks Ronaldo's return to Spanish football after nine trophy-laden seasons at Real Madrid before he left for Juventus in the summer of 2018.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo has taken a step toward retirement after a staggering 24-year-long career\n\nRonaldo, 41, has acquired a 25 per cent stake in Spanish side UD Almeria\n\n'It has been a longtime ambition of mine to contribute to football, beyond the pitch,' the Al-Nassr and Portugal captain said in a statement.\n\n'UD Almeria is a Spanish club with strong foundations and clear potential for growth. I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club's next phase of growth.'\n\nIt is the latest hint that Ronaldo's historic playing career could soon be at an end, with this a clear indication of him setting up a life for when he eventually decides to hang up his boots.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner has already stated that the World Cup this summer will 'definitely' be his last, and while he is still 'enjoying the moment' when it comes to playing football, he believes he only has a further year or two left in the legs.\n\nThey are the same legs that he joked he could play 10 further years in just last year, but even the most in-shape 41-year-old you will ever see in football knows that he can't play on forever.\n\nRonaldo has made it clear as day for years now that he has wanted to move into ownership, and the legwork for his new venture arguably began back in 2022 after his acrimonious exit from Manchester United.\n\nReports suggest that Mohamed Al Khereiji, a Saudi businessman, played a role in finalising Ronaldo's big-money move to Al Nassr, and the pair have remained close ever since.\n\nAl Khereiji leads the Saudi investment group, SMC, which last year acquired Almeria from Turki Al-Sheikh, who is a Saudi government official and now plays an influential role in setting up boxing's biggest fights.\n\n'We are very pleased that Cristiano has chosen our club to invest in,' said Al Khereiji. 'He is regarded as the greatest to ever play the game, he knows the Spanish leagues very well and he understands the potential of what we are building here both in terms of the team and the academy.'\n\nFollowing retirement, coaching and punditry are normally the two viable career options for players. It is very rare for ex-players to venture into ownership.\n\nHowever, much like David Beckham, who owns MLS side Inter Miami, and Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe, who has a majority stake in SM Caen, Ronaldo has both the personal brand and financial power to assume an ownership position.\n\nRonaldo's lucrative career had led him to a stratosphere of his own financially. He is the best-paid player in the sport's history, being paid an annual salary of £177million.\n\nIt is said that he is worth £1.04bn after finance experts Bloomberg took a deep dive into his career earnings, investments and endorsement deals and they were all adjusted for prevailing tax rates and market performance.\n\nThey have previously reported that Ronaldo's astronomical money in Saudi Arabia has 'catapulted him to the top of the rankings for highest-earning sportspeople'.\n\nHe is the first footballer in their new Bloomberg Billionaires Index and they note that his wealth now significantly eclipses long-time rival Lionel Messi after the Argentine opted to move to the US with Inter Miami.\n\nRonaldo's links to Saudi Arabia spanning back to 2022 may have helped him secure his dream of becoming a club owner\n\nRonaldo has a lifetime deal with Nike, reported to be worth £745m in total - by far his biggest agreement with any company. There are partnerships with Tag Heuer, Armani, PokerStars, Samsung, Unilever, Louis Vuitton and many, many more.\n\nHe is also currently building an extraordinary, sprawling complex back home costing £28m, of which the lavish renderings have been shared and is often seen draped in the world's most expensive jewellery and watches, including a Franck Muller Invisible Baguette Diamonds Imperial Tourbillon - worth £1.13m.\n\nRonaldo's longevity, of course, has only helped him add to his fortune, but he's more than happy to splash the cash he's rolling in. While it is yet to be known how much he is investing in Almeria, it's likely to be just pocket money for one of the sport's best-ever players.\n\nHe has also invested in a property on the Portuguese Riviera with the dream of building a 'hospital-sized' mansion in Quinta da Marinha - but the project is over two years behind schedule.\n\nA number of CGI images of what the property might look like when completed have been shared by Ronaldo's supporters, eager for a glimpse of the future, but for now, the project remains a building site, as well as a nuisance to his neighbours.\n\nRonaldo's mansion is set to include a giant glass swimming pool with an underwater walkway, and a master bedroom measuring 1,000 square feet as part of what is believed to be Portugal's most expensive property development.\n\nThe comfortable life of luxury off the pitch shows no sign of slowing down, while he continually builds his portfolio off it.\n\nRonaldo's step into club ownership comes 14 months after he hinted at one day delving into that role at Manchester United.\n\nSpeaking at the Dubai Globe Soccer Awards in December 2024, he said the club's struggles weren't just down to on-pitch issues - with the problems far greater than that.\n\n'[The] Premier League it's the most difficult league in the world,' he said. 'All the teams are good, all the teams fight, all the teams run, all the teams are strong. Football is different right now. There's no easy games any more.\n\n'They need, I said this one year and a half ago, and I will continue to say it: The problem is not the coaches, it's like... I always give this example... it's like an aquarium.\n\n'If you have the fish inside and he's sick and you take him out and you fix the problem and you put him again in an aquarium, you will be sick again. The problem of Manchester United is the same. The problem is not always the coach. It's much more than that.\n\nRonaldo (pictured with fiancee Georgina Rodríguez) has built a life of luxury outside of football due to his fortune\n\nRonaldo is believed to worth £1.04bn which means a small stake in Almeria will likely cost him just pocket change\n\n'If I will be the owner of the club, I will make things clear and adjust things that are bad there.'\n\nThose words followed his TalkTV interview with Piers Morgan in 2021 that served as the final nail in the coffin for his second spell at United, where Ronaldo alleged co-owners Joel and Avram Glazer 'don't care' about the club.\n\n'The owners of the club, the Glazers, they don't care about the club,' he said. 'I mean, professional sport, as you know this, Manchester (United) is a marketing club.\n\n'They will get its money from the marketing - the sport, they don't really care, in my opinion.'\n\n\n\n'You have some things inside the club which don't help Manchester (United) reach the top level as City, Liverpool and even now Arsenal, for example... which is complicated, it's difficult.'"

Our challenges are collective, but the players must get them by producing individual numbers for the team.\n\nOllie Watkins has rarely found top form yet he has still scored eight times this season\n\n'I have massive respect for Ollie Watkins and massive respect for Tammy Abraham. They are both fantastic strikers.\n\n'Whoever plays tomorrow (Friday), or if they play together, they must perform and focus on our gameplan to achieve three points.\n\n'Our challenge is to help our offensive players score more goals. It's not only about them. It's about the structure we have, to help them to feel comfortable and confident, and create more in the attacking third.'\n\nEmery also warned Villa not to be complacent against the Premier League's bottom club - due to his own winless record at Molineux.\n\nThe Spaniard has never won at Molineux as manager of Arsenal or Villa, losing three of his four games there and drawing the other.\n\n'We've been together three-and-a-half years, and we've drawn twice at Molineux and lost once,' recalled Emery. 'When I was at Arsenal, we were 3-0 down at half-time (before losing 3-1).\n\n'We beat them 1-0 earlier in the season and we didn't deserve to win. They've lost some other games, against Chelsea and Bournemouth, where they haven't deserved to lose.\n\n'In their last home game, they drew with Arsenal, the best team in the Premier League and maybe the world.\n\n\n\n'Everything we have analysed makes us feel it is not an easy game, and it's also a derby. They will want to show what they can do in front of their own fans.'"

Ryan Yates suffers horror finger injury during Nottingham Forest's Europa League clash with Fenerbahce - and plays on anyway!\n\nNottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates suffered a sickening finger injury against Fenerbahce - but played on all the same.\n\nThe midfielder dislocated his pinkie finger after falling and landing awkwardly barely seven minutes into the second leg of Forest's Europa League play-off.\n\nYates, 28, was in clear pain and required immediate attention from Forest's medical team at the City Ground.\n\nTNT Sports considered the incident too grisly to show a replay of due to Yates' finger being bent at a 90-degree angle.\n\nBut the Englishman simply soldiered on from there in a show of toughness.\n\nCommentator Darren Fletcher said: 'The fact he's just gestured to the physio and said, \"Can you come and just sort this out,\" is remarkable.\n\nNottingham Forest captain Ryan Yates dislocated his finger after landing awkwardly during their Europa League clash with Fenerbahce\n\nHe called over medical attention and, once patched up, simply carried on playing\n\n'They'll just stick it back in. He's actually smiling about it. We're not going to show you it because it can put you off your tea.'\n\nForest's fans were impressed by their skipper's determination, with one writing on X: 'Ryan Yates is rock 'ard isn't he?'\n\n'Hard as nails. Proper footballer. My captain,' another said.\n\n'I would have had a week off work,' one quipped.\n\nIt wasn't even the worst viewing for Forest fans on the night.\n\nThe East Midlands club thrashed Fenerbahce 3-0 in the away leg last week in Vitor Pereira's first game in charge.\n\nBut the Turkish club came to England with a vengeance, taking a 1-0 lead after 22 minutes thanks to Kerem Akturkoglu.\n\nAnd Akturkoglu doubled Fenerbahce's lead from the penalty spot early in the second half after Jair Cunha's foul, which many felt had been cheaply given.\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi halved the deficit and gave Forest breathing room in the tie after 68 minutes with a superb bottom-corner finish.\n\n\n\nFrom there, Pereira's side hung on to win the tie 4-2 on aggregate, despite being spooked and losing 2-1 on the night."

            "content": "Chelsea recorded the highest pretax losses in English football history in the 2024-25 season — but club sources insist it will not force them into selling their biggest stars.\n\nThe European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report listed the 10 largest losses for 2025 and revealed how the Blues, who are owned by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly, booked a €407million deficit. That has only ever been beaten by Barcelona, who fell into a €555m hole from the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nHowever, Chelsea insiders speaking anonymously insisted to Daily Mail Sport that the reported loss does not reflect their true health, saying it is the result of non-cash accounting adjustments as required by UEFA regulations and tied to the acquisition of the Blues. That includes asset impairments, settlements related to historical matters under the previous ownership, and the resolution of legacy contracts.\n\nThose same sources say, after an internal reset, the club is now profitable on an operating basis and aligned with UEFA as they expect to meet all the obligations under their existing settlement agreement with European football’s governing body. They entered into that agreement after previous financial breaches.\n\nCrucially for supporters, Daily Mail Sport has been told there is no requirement for Chelsea to start selling key players such as Cole Palmer or Moises Caicedo in order to meet regulatory thresholds.\n\nWe are assured there is no financial pressure on them to offload any key members of the squad they do not wish to lose this summer, and that their approach to player trading will be strategic rather than reactive.\n\nDespite winning two trophies - including the Club World Cup - last season, Chelsea are thought to have recorded a staggering record pre-tax loss\n\nChelsea have taken to structuring player contracts with performance incentives tied to Champions League participation, which would help cover the cost of missing out on Europe’s elite competition.\n\nNaturally, they do not hope that scenario occurs at the end of this season, with the Blues still in contention for a top-five finish in the Premier League as they travel to face Arsenal this Sunday.\n\nUEFA’s figures covered the 2024-25 season when Chelsea were competing in the Conference League, which they won. They also finished fourth in the Premier League to return to the Champions League before going on to win the Club World Cup in the summer.\n\nChelsea’s creative financing has helped their financial position in the Premier League, such as the infamous internal selling of their women’s team to the club’s parent company. UEFA’s rules are more stringent as they do not take income into account."

            "content": "Ian Wright claims Tottenham stars have already 'CHECKED OUT' on new boss Igor Tudor despite club fearing tumultuous relegation battle\n\nIan Wright suggested that some of Tottenham's biggest stars are unwilling to give new interim manager Igor Tudor a chance, after Micky Van de Ven appeared to blank him during the north London derby.\n\nAppointed following the overdue sacking of Thomas Frank earlier this month, Tudor arrived with the challenging brief of ensuring that Spurs avoid relegation.\n\nThe Europa League champions currently sit 16th and only four points away from 18th-placed West Ham - and Tudor's arrival in the capital was made no easier by his first match in charge being the north London derby.\n\nAs Spurs fell 4-1 to Arsenal at home, Tudor was spotted apparently giving vocal instructions to Van de Ven from the sidelines, only for the defender to fail to acknowledge him.\n\nFor Wright, the fact that the players were not eager to engage with their new head coach was a troubling sign.\n\n'Against Arsenal I saw Igor Tudor try to speak to Van de Ven, he blanked him, totally blanked him,' Wright said to his co-hosts on The Overlap's Stick To Football podcast.\n\nIgor Tudor appeared to be ignored by Micky Van de Ven just days into his tenure as Tottenham interim head coach\n\n'That says to me they have checked out already.'\n\nGary Neville thought that Wright's verdict was a 'harsh' one, while Roy Keane argued that the players 'did that with' Frank, but the Arsenal legend was in no mood to back down.\n\n'This guy is new, he wants him to come up and Van de Ven just looks at him and stays there,' Wright continued. 'You think to yourself, that doesn't look good. That does not look good.'\n\nFor his part, Tudor denied conflict between himself and Van de Ven on Thursday afternoon, sharing that he had been addressing the whole team.\n\n'If you watch carefully, I don't speak to him (in that moment),' Tudor said in his pre-Premier League weekend press conference. 'Afterwards, I said to him to come closer, and he comes closer.\n\n'We didn't talk about it because nothing happened. He's a fantastic professional and a fantastic guy, he would not do something like (ignoring me).'\n\nBelgium head coach Roberto Martinez stressed that whatever Tudor can do to ensure Spurs do not spend next season in the Championship, his first order of business should be 'accepting where they are' at this stage in the campaign.\n\n'When I was at Wigan you almost prepared for that last third of the season because that is your opportunity,' Martinez said. 'The last third for us was that we are going to get out of trouble.\n\n'The problem is when you are going into the last third hoping you are not going to get dragged down into a relegation battle because your club wasn't ready for that. This is where it becomes very, very dangerous.\n\nThe stop-gap manager has a challenging task attempting to keep Spurs from the drop - and began his reign with a dismal north London derby\n\n'What happens now is that you should forget about these general terms that \"we shouldn't get dragged down\", what does this mean to a player (looking to hear) \"do I need to run more, less\".\n\n'It is basic language (you use to a player) about everything you can control, \"you have to do 12km, six sprints into the box and run to the near post\". Everything has to be so measurable. It is about winning the next game.'\n\nSpurs' torrid winter has been only exacerbated by a number of injuries to key players leaving their squad painfully short.\n\nBut Martinez was keen to warn that Spurs cannot wait for stars to return and simply expect fortunes to change.\n\n'I think Spurs will get one or two players back from injury, you win a game and then you have got too much (of a gap),' he added.\n\n'The problem is there are no easy games in the Premier League. As a player at Spurs you might think there are easy games we can win, no - there are no easy games. It is about reducing that to, it is the next game and you have an opportunity to get points rather than if you don't win and you are out.\n\n'The moment that the club see it as \"wow, if we don't win...\" - the mindset is so negative and it drags you down. We have seen teams that are \"too good to go down\" go down because they weren't prepared for that final third of the season.'\n\n\n\nSpurs will stay in London for their next Premier League test, travelling to Craven Cottage to play Fulham on Sunday."

But if you watch the video, that's not my voice.\n\n\"It’s something that I’d never say. I don’t really know how that kind of took a storm on its own when I play here (in Ottawa) and give everything I have here.\n\n\"I just think that's something that I never thought would happen in my head, and especially would never say.

Asked why they laughed, Tkachuk said: “Honestly, it was just a whirlwind of a moment that (you) can't really control what somebody says, and it's just caught (me) off guard a little bit.\"\n\nWomen's team captain, Hilary Knight, deemed the comment \"distasteful and unfortunate\", which Tkachuk understood, saying: \"I mean, I get it.

Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter.\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel, who entered the night shooting 43.6% from beyond the arc and leading the league in 3s, broke the record off an assist from Sion James, his college teammate at Duke.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s on the night (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\nKnueppel is a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball, using his basketball IQ to find open spots on the floor -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie in with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the mid-range and play develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Ohio State linebacker Sonny Styles, a projected top-10 pick in this year's NFL draft, had one of the best vertical jumps for a player at his position in more than two decades Thursday, the first night of on-field workouts at the NFL combine in Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nStyles's 43½-inch vertical jump was the highest by an off-ball linebacker at the combine since 2003 and the second highest by any linebacker in that span behind Cameron Wake's 45½-inch jump in 2005.\n\nAt 6-foot-5, 244 pounds, Styles, rated No. 7 on ESPN insider Mel Kiper Jr.'s big board, also had a 4.46 clocking in the 40-yard dash to go with an 11-foot-2-inch broad jump and a standout performance in position drills. His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told Sportv. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\"\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process,\" Neymar added.\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must miss the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would miss the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to miss the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area where the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got t-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "A former Chief Justice, Sophia Akuffo, has called on public policy think tanks to raise their game and push harder on critical national issues.\n\nSpeaking on Joy News’ PM Express Business Edition on Thursday with host George Wiafe, she said more must be done to shape policy and challenge entrenched practices.\n\n“I think we should be doing more,” she stated.\n\nResponding to a question on whether think tanks are comfortable in their space, she pointed to the work of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) as an example of what should be happening.\n\n“At least, I like what we’re doing here at IEA.”\n\nSophia Akuffo explained that think tanks' role goes beyond routine commentary. It involves drawing national attention to issues that may be ignored or taken for granted.\n\n“We seek to draw the public’s attention first and foremost, on certain critical issues that may be falling between the cracks or because of long-standing past practices nobody is even thinking of, is this really how it should be done?”\n\nAccording to her, that reflective function is essential in a democracy. It forces a rethink of systems that have operated for years without scrutiny.\n\n“So we look at those things,” she added.\n\nSophia Akuffo cited the constitutional review process as a practical example of how think tanks can influence governance and national direction.\n\n“So even with the constitutional review, if you recall, through 2023/24 we were working intensively on coming up with proposals for constitutional review.”\n\nHer comments suggest that think tanks must not only react to policy decisions but proactively shape debate.\n\nFor her, the work done around the 2023/24 constitutional review shows how sustained research and proposals can keep reform conversations alive.\n\nSophia Akuffo made it clear that think tanks have a responsibility to interrogate long-standing systems and question whether they still serve the public interest.\n\nBy focusing on issues “falling between the cracks,” she argued, policy institutions can help prevent complacency in governance. Long-standing practices, she implied, must not escape review simply because they have become routine.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Grand jury proceedings remain ongoing, according to US media.\n\nD4vd has not commented on the case, but his representatives previously said he was cooperating with police.\n\nA lawyer for the singer did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.\n\nThe unsealed court filings mark the latest chapter in a case which has been dissected by internet sleuths for months.\n\nOn 8 September 2025, investigators found the decomposed head and torso of 14-year-old Celeste Rivas Hernandez in a cadaver bag in the front boot of a Tesla car registered to D4vd's address in Texas, the court documents said.\n\nWhen they removed the bag, they discovered severed arms and legs in a black bag, the documents said.\n\nD4vd - who released his debut album in April - was on tour when the remains were discovered.\n\nCeleste Rivas Hernandez, of Lake Elsinore, California, was reported missing before she was found dead and dismembered\n\nPolice had previously said that they discovered Rivas Hernandez's remains inside the boot of the impounded car after responding to reports of a foul odour at the Hollywood tow yard.\n\nRivas Hernandez, from Lake Elsinore in California, had been missing and was last seen in April 2024, according to a missing person flyer cited by CBS, the BBC's US news partner.\n\nThe decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators have said.\n\nA police spokesperson previously said that the case was being investigated by its robbery-homicide division.\n\nAs the grand jury proceedings got under way last year, the court filings said that prosecutors believed the testimony of D4vd's family was \"material and necessary\" to the investigation.\n\nBut Dawud Burke, along with his wife Colleen and son Caleb, have argued that the summons violates their right to due process because the notice they received from the California court contained redacted information, according to Texas court transcripts included in the filings.\n\n\"The Court ordered Mr. Burke to travel across the country to appear before a California grand jury without ever allowing him to see the full documents that justified the extraordinary compulsion,\" Dawud Burke's attorney said in the filing.\n\nHe challenged the California court's out-of-state subpoena, which he believed was compelling him to travel against his will.\n\nLos Angeles Police Department detectives travelled to Texas to bring the singer's family to California to appear before the grand jury, whose proceedings are secret, court records said.\n\nThe related documents have provided the biggest tranche of information about the case thus far, delineating key details in the ongoing investigation, which has been shrouded in secrecy.\n\nIn November, the Los Angeles County medical examiner's office said it received a court order imposing a security hold on the case, and that no details about Rivas Hernandez's death could be released or posted on its website.\n\nThe police department said it requested the order to ensure officers \"receive information from the Medical Examiner before the public\".\n\nChief Medical Examiner Dr Odey Ukpo said the practice of security holds is \"virtually unheard of in other counties\" and \"has not been proven to improve outcomes in the legal system\".\n\nThe Los Angeles District Attorney's Office declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The U.S. aims to process 4,500 refugee applications from white South Africans per month, far above President Donald Trump's stated refugee program cap, and is installing trailers on embassy property in Pretoria to support the effort, according to a U.S. contracting document.\n\nThe new target, contained in a previously unreported document from the U.S. State Department dated January 27, signals a push to ramp up admissions from South Africa, while refugee applications from other areas have been severely curtailed.\n\nTrump has said the U.S. would only admit 7,500 total refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2026, while a much higher cap of 40,000 to 60,000 was discussed internally last year. Only 2,000 white South Africans had entered the U.S. as refugees as of January 31 under a program launched in May 2025, although the pace has picked up in recent months.\n\nThe ambitious target could also face administrative delays in Washington, which in recent weeks have halted all refugee travel to the U.S., including white South Africans, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter.\n\nThe U.S. State Department and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment. The White House referred questions to the State Department.\n\nThe South African Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. said last year that more than 67,000 people had expressed interest in relocating.\n\nTrump ordered a halt to refugee admissions into the U.S. after taking office in 2025 as part of his crackdown on legal and illegal immigration. But weeks later, he launched an effort to bring in white South Africans of Afrikaner ethnicity as refugees, saying they had been violently persecuted in the majority-Black country. South Africa's government has rejected that claim, while some refugee advocates have criticized the Trump policy.\n\nU.S. SEES URGENT NEED FOR REFUGEE PROCESSING SITE\n\nThe contracting document, posted to a U.S. government database on Wednesday, explains the rationale for awarding the contract for the trailers without a competitive bidding process, stressing an urgent need for a secure site.\n\nAn immigration raid by South African authorities on a previous U.S. refugee processing site on a commercial property in Johannesburg had forced the government to consider a more secure location, it said, after \"operations were compromised.\"\n\n\"The inability to safely process about 4,500 applicants per month, an objective communicated to (the U.S. State Department's refugee division) from the White House, would result in failure to meet a Presidential priority,\" the document said.\n\nSouth African Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri said his government would not interfere with the U.S. program if it remained within legal boundaries, while reiterating Pretoria's rejection of Trump's claims about white South Africans.\n\n\"The assertion that Afrikaners face systemic persecution is fundamentally unsubstantiated,\" he said.\n\nWhether the U.S. could reach the ambitious 4,500 per month target remains unclear. The State Department last week canceled all refugee travel - including for South Africans - from February 23 to March 9 due to operational factors, an email sent to applicants said.\n\nBecause of Trump's sweeping refugee ban issued in January 2025, South Africans must be admitted as exceptions on a case-by-case basis by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nThe U.S. official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal operations, said DHS had delayed the approvals, creating an administrative backlog.\n\nPrior to the pause on admissions, South African entries had been ramping up, with about 1,500 admitted in December and January, compared with about 500 in the previous six and a half months, according to U.S. State Department figures.\n\nAFTER PUBLIC U.S.-SOUTH AFRICA TENSIONS, A PRIVATE AGREEMENT\n\nTensions between the U.S. and South Africa over the refugee effort boiled over in mid-December when South African authorities raided the commercial building in Johannesburg where U.S. staff and contractors were working on refugee cases.\n\nSeven Kenyans working as contractors for a U.S.-based refugee group were arrested for alleged violations of their visa terms, while two U.S. refugee officers were briefly detained.\n\nU.S. and South African officials reached an agreement during a closed-door meeting in late December to allow processing to continue, Reuters reported last month.\n\nThe contracting document said a South African company had received a no-bid $772,000 contract to supply and install 14 prefabricated modular buildings as part of a \"temporary modular village\" on an embassy property in Pretoria.\n\nIn a WhatsApp group for South Africans to share information about the program, one applicant said they had an interview this week in a trailer-like structure at an embassy property and that more trailers were being prepared, suggesting the site was now operational.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Buriram’s mix of long straights and heavy braking zones is a brutal early test for riders and engineers alike, demanding outright power, racecraft and composure under pressure.\n\nFrom there, the calendar reflects a championship both global and evolving. MotoGP makes a long-awaited return to Brazil after 21 years, reconnecting with a passionate fanbase that last witnessed the sport in Rio back in 2004. Argentina, meanwhile, steps aside for the season, with plans already in place for a comeback.\n\nOn track, all eyes are firmly on Marc Márquez. After claiming the 2025 Riders’ Championship and ending the longest title drought ever endured by a premier-class champion, the Spaniard arrives as the man to beat.\n\nBacked by the might of the Ducati Lenovo factory team, Márquez will start as favourite as he chases yet more history. But the grid behind him is stacked with motivation and unfinished business.\n\nTeammate Francesco Bagnaia will be desperate to respond after a frustrating 2025, while Alex Márquez continues his rise on the BK8 Gresini Ducati.\n\nJorge Martin, the 2024 champion, returns renewed and refocused on the Aprilia after an injury-hit campaign, and Fabio Quartararo carries Yamaha’s hopes with his trademark aggression and finesse.\n\nAdding fresh intrigue is the arrival of three-time World Superbike Champion Toprak Razgatlıoğlu, who makes his highly anticipated MotoGP debut with Prima Pramac Yamaha. Known for his fearless braking and flair, Toprak’s transition from production racing to prototypes is one of the season’s great unknowns.\n\nHe’s joined by reigning Moto2 champion Diogo Moreira, stepping up to the premier class with LCR Honda, bringing youthful confidence and raw speed to the grid.\n\nWith legendary riders, new stars, historic returns and the end of a technical era, the 2026 MotoGP season feels like a turning point. Every race, every overtake and every championship twist unfolds live on SuperSport – where the world’s fastest riders push limits, chase glory and write the next chapter of MotoGP history.\n\nMotoGP: Thailand Grand Prix\n\nSaturday 28 February\n\n03:30AM: MotoGP Qualifying 1 – LIVE on SuperSport Motorsport and SuperSport Maximo 1\n\n03:15 AM: MotoGP Qualifying 2 – LIVE on SuperSport Motorsport and SuperSport Maximo 1\n\nFrom 07:45AM: Moto 3 and Moto 2 Qualifying – LIVE on SuperSport Motorsport and SuperSport Maximo 1\n\n08:00AM: MotoGP Sprint – LIVE on SuperSport Motorsport and SuperSport Maximo 1\n\nSunday 1 March\n\n05:00 AM Moto3 Race – LIVE on SuperSport Motorsport and SuperSport Maximo 1\n\n06:15 AM: Moto 2 Race – LIVE on SuperSport Motorsport and SuperSport Maximo 1\n\n08:00 AM: MotoGP Race – LIVE on SuperSport Motorsport and SuperSport Maximo 1\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nTags:\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Russia says it has handed over the remains of 1,000 soldiers to Ukraine and has received the bodies of 35 Russian soldiers in return.\n\nIt comes as Ukraine's chief negotiator met with US President Donald Trump's envoys in Geneva to discuss economic plans for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war.\n\nNegotiators were also preparing for a third round of US-led talks aimed at ending the conflict, which has entered its fifth year, including a trilateral meeting involving the Russian side, too.\n\nHours before the Geneva talks, Russia launched 420 drones and 39 missiles in six different regions of Ukraine, injuring dozens of people, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said.\n\nVladimir Medinsky, a top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced the exchange of bodies in a brief Telegram post. He gave no details, but included an image showing bodies being unloaded from a truck.\n\nHours later, Ukraine said it had received 1,000 bodies, which, \"according to prior information from the Russian side, may belong to Ukrainian defenders\".\n\nThe two sides have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict that began with Putin's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.\n\nThe exchange is based on an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in June 2025. Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of up to 6,000 soldiers each, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.\n\nKyiv and Moscow regularly publish estimates of the other side's losses, but do not detail their own.\n\nZelensky recently admitted 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed on the battlefield - a figure Western observers describe as an underestimate, as it does not include those missing.\n\nAnd from public sources, the BBC has confirmed the names of almost 186,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine. The true death toll is generally accepted to be much higher, as many deaths on the battlefield are not recorded.\n\nSo even though estimates suggest more Russians are dying every day, Moscow has returned more bodies to Ukraine overall than it has received.\n\nNo one has explained the discrepancy, even though Russia has previously accused Ukraine of not abiding by the Istanbul agreement, and Ukraine has alleged Russian body returns were irregular and sometimes included Russians' remains - a charge Moscow has rejected.\n\nOne possible explanation is that Russia captures more Ukrainian bodies, given its troops have been on the attack most of the time and, therefore, are more able to retrieve them from the battlefield.\n\nOn the eve of the Geneva talks, President Zelensky had a telephone conversation with Trump and said he expected the Geneva meeting would lead to trilateral negotiations at the beginning of March - thus creating \"an opportunity to move talks to the leaders' level\".\n\n\"President Trump supports this sequence of steps,\" Zelensky said, adding: \"This is the only way to resolve all the complex and sensitive issues and finally end the war.\"\n\nPutin, for his part, has refused to meet Zelensky, describing him as illegitimate - an argument centring on the fact that no presidential election has been held in Ukraine, despite the expiry of Zelensky's term in March 2024.\n\nHowever, Ukraine's constitution bars holding elections under martial law - imposed in the wake of Putin's invasion of his neighbour.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

I said I wanted to be a pastor,” he recounted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, family members began calling him “Pastor” while he was growing up. However, he admitted that at the time, he did not fully grasp the spiritual weight of that declaration despite the numerous prophecies.\n\n\n\nOn whether he attended Bible school to prepare for ministry, Prof Amartey explained that his church provided structured spiritual training.\n\n\n\n“Revival Outreach Church itself is a pastoral school because there is constant training.

When you have this type of situation, you're generating uncertainty and that's damaging for an institution's image.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking about the case at the same event, Premier League chief executive Richard Masters said he \"can't talk about the timing of it\".\n\n\n\n\"I simply can't comment,\" he said. \"Having spent three years not commenting, I'm not going to start now.\n\n\n\n\"Stepping aside from that [specific case], any regulator wants its judicial system to be efficient and work swiftly. That's about as far as I can go.\""

The body was later conveyed to the Police Hospital Morgue.”\n\n\n\nAnthony, until his death, was an employee of Dizengoff Ghana Limited, a well-known agribusiness firm as IT Personal for Security installations for Akosombo, Ashanti Goldfields and others.\n\nAccording to the grieving father, the case was handled by Chief Inspector Bekoe under the supervision of ASP Zoyah, the Ayi Mensah District Commander.\n\n\n\nHe revealed that two men in plain clothes later visited the crime scene with the Investigator, claiming they had been sent from the Homicide Unit to assist with investigations.\n\n\n\nEhiamah disclosed that Chief Inspector Bekoe informed the family that two individuals-Obed Sam and Henry Gomashie-had been identified as prime suspects out of six persons interviewed.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the suspects allegedly contacted Anthony’s widow on the following day of the murder, claiming they had been assigned by their employer and were trying to reach him.\n\n\n\n“So, I quickly went to my son’s work place to find out if it is true that he was assigned but the reply was No”.\n\nIn a further disturbing revelation, Ehiamah said Anthony’s mother informed him that on the morning of his death, Anthony had confided in her that some individuals were using his bank account to transfer illicit funds and that his life was being threatened.\n\n\n\n“This information corroborated what the investigator himself told me-that monies meant for the school feeding programme were allegedly being siphoned into my son’s account,” he said.\n\n\n\n“My fear is that my son’s death is linked to these illicit transactions.”\n\n\n\nEhiamah questioned why, despite these alleged findings, no decisive action was taken.\n\n\n\n“When I asked the investigator what his next step would be, his responses were riddled with inconsistencies,” he claimed.\n\nHe said Chief Inspector Bekoe later informed the family that the docket had been forwarded to the Attorney-General’s office for advice.\n\n\n\nThe family went to AG office to find out if the Docket was sent to them but it was not so, they then petitioned the AG for the first time.\n\n\n\nThe father further alleged that the prime suspects were granted bail by the investigating officers without being arraigned before a court and without notifying the family.\n\n\n\n“We were shocked. On their own will, they granted bail. We were not informed. No court process. Nothing,” he said.\n\n\n\nEhiamah said he had since petitioned the Greater Accra Regional Police Command and the Office of the Inspector-General of Police, alleging possible misconduct and concealment of vital information by the officers handling the case.\n\nNow, he is appealing directly to President John Dramani Mahama, the Vice President, and the Inspector-General of Police to intervene.\n\n\n\n“Your Excellency, I respectfully submit this petition to cause an enquiry into the activities of these officers and to ensure a proper, independent investigation into the murder of my son,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe grieving father insisted he was ready to cooperate with any fresh or independent probe, even if it included the original investigators.\n\n\n\n“I will make myself available. I have nothing to hide. All I want is justice for my son,” he declared. “The very officers entrusted to protect lives must not be seen as shielding suspects. Justice must not only be done, it must be seen to be done.”\n\n\n\nCopies of petition have so far been sent to IGP, Vice President office, EOCO, IN, National Security and the CID."

The work of surveyors forms the foundation upon which investment decisions are made,” he added.\n\nHe explained that with pension and insurance funds now holding tens of billions of cedis in long-term capital, significant opportunities exist to address Ghana’s housing deficit and expand infrastructure development.\n\n\n\nHowever, he cautioned that investors require certainty and transparency before committing funds.\n\n\n\n“Institutional capital flows where systems are trusted. Precision, ethical conduct, and professional collaboration are essential to attracting long-term investment,” Fynn stated.\n\n\n\nThe event also marked the induction of about 275 new members into the Ghana Institution of Surveyors and the elevation of 28 professionals to fellowship status, a development organisers described as strengthening professional capacity within the sector.\n\n\n\nPresident of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors, Surveyor Kofi Obeng-Ayirebi, used the occasion to underscore the importance of professional discipline, warning that members who remain inactive for three consecutive years will be expelled from the institution.\n\n“Our profession plays a critical role in Ghana’s development, and maintaining active professional participation is essential to safeguarding standards and public trust,” he said.\n\n\n\nHe reiterated that surveyors remain key actors in Ghana’s development agenda, particularly in ensuring land administration efficiency, infrastructure planning, and sustainable urban growth.\n\n\n\nWith hundreds of new professionals joining the institution alongside experienced fellows, the Ghana Institution of Surveyors says it is positioning itself to play an even stronger role in supporting Ghana’s journey toward sustainable development.\n\n\n\nA total of 275 Professional Members and 2 Technician Members were inducted and admitted as new members of the Ghana Institution of Surveyors during its 21st Surveyors’ Week Celebration and 57th Annual General Meeting."

President Mahama had announced that TOR would officially resume crude oil refining by the end of October 2025, describing it as a major step toward reviving the facility after years of inactivity.\n\n\n\nHowever, Nana Kay questioned the credibility of the announcement, citing the latest report from the Bank of Ghana, which he said indicated that no crude oil had been imported for refining as of the reporting period. He argued that the absence of crude imports casts doubt on the refinery’s readiness to resume operations as scheduled.\n\nHe stressed that given TOR’s strategic importance to Ghana’s energy sector, there must be greater accountability in how oil supplies are secured and managed. The refinery’s prolonged inactivity has heightened concerns about Ghana’s energy independence and its continued reliance on imported refined petroleum products.\n\n\n\n“The citizens deserve to know how these resources are handled, especially at such a sensitive and pivotal time for Ghana's energy sector,” Nana Kay stated.\n\n\n\nHis call for an investigation comes amid growing public concern over the adequacy and fairness of petroleum supply chains, as well as their impact on national fuel prices and the broader economy.\n\n\n\nHe further questioned the integrity of the processes employed by TOR’s leadership and the implications of their operations for consumers and businesses across the country."

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "Al Jazeera's correspondent in Kabul reports explosions and anti-aircraft fire as Pakistan bombs the capital city.\n\nPakistan has bombed Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, and other cities, as fighting spread following attacks by Afghan forces against Pakistani military positions along their shared border earlier.\n\nPakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that his country’s “patience has run out” with the Taliban authorities in neighbouring Afghanistan, and that Pakistan would now be waging “open war”.\n\nAl Jazeera’s correspondent in Kabul, Nasser Shadid, reported early on Friday that a bombing raid targeted the Afghan capital at 1:50 am local time (21:20 GMT), followed by a second air raid.\n\nAfghan anti-aircraft guns opened fire after the first raid and continued firing after the second, according to Shadid.\n\nAn Afghan government source confirmed to Al Jazeera that an air strike had hit Kabul, and Pakistani warplanes also hit a military base in Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan.\n\nPakistan’s Defence Minister Asif framed the attack as one that his country had been forced to make, and followed “aggression” from Afghanistan.\n\nPakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that 133 Afghan Taliban fighters had been killed in Pakistan’s attacks on Friday, and that Taliban positions had been targeted in Kabul, Kandahar, and Paktia.\n\nTarar said that nine Taliban positions had been captured, and 27 destroyed, while adding that Pakistani attacks were continuing.\n\nAfghan government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that Afghanistan had launched its own attacks against Pakistani military bases in Kandahar and Helmand following the latest Pakistani attacks.\n\n\n\nThe strikes followed attacks by Afghan forces late on Thursday on Pakistani positions on the border shared by the two countries.\n\nAn Afghan military source told Al Jazeera that 10 Pakistani soldiers were killed in the attacks, and 13 outposts captured.\n\nThe source added that the attacks were a response to Pakistani attacks on Afghan positions in the border region on Sunday.\n\nPakistan claimed that its attacks on Sunday had killed at least 70 fighters, but Afghanistan rejected the claim, saying that civilians had been killed.\n\nPoor relations\n\nRelations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which share a 2,611km-long (1,622-mile-long) border, have nose-dived since fighting in October killed more than 70 people on both sides of the border.\n\nThe tension stems from Pakistani accusations that Kabul has allowed armed groups such as the Pakistan Taliban to use Afghanistan as a base, and launch attacks on Pakistan.\n\nThe Pakistan Taliban shares deep ideological ties with the Taliban in Afghanistan, but is a distinct movement.\n\n“Pakistan made every effort to keep the situation normal through direct means and through friendly countries,” said Asif. “It engaged in full-fledged diplomacy. But the Taliban became a proxy for India.”\n\n“In the past, Pakistan’s role has been positive. It has hosted five million Afghans for 50 years. Even today, millions of Afghans are earning their livelihood on our soil. Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” Asif said.\n\nThe United Nations has called for urgent de-escalation. “[UN Secretary-General] Antonio Guterres urges the parties to uphold their obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, and to ensure the protection of civilians,” Stephane Dujarric, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General, said.\n\n“The Secretary-General urges the parties to continue seeking to resolve any differences through diplomatic channels and commends the mediation efforts undertaken by several Member States in recent months,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Zalmay Khalilzad, a former US ambassador to Afghanistan, said earlier on Thursday that the tit-for-tat attacks over recent days were a “terrible dynamic that must stop”.\n\n“A better option is a diplomatic agreement between the [two] countries that neither would allow its territory to be used by individuals and groups to threaten the security of the other,” Khalilzad said. “The implementation of the agreement should be monitored by a trusted [third] party, for example Turkiye. This approach is a much wiser course than continuing with attacks and counter-attacks.”"

            "content": "A federal judge has ruled that the Internal Revenue Service violated its code by giving a US immigration agency confidential taxpayer data.\n\nA federal judge in the United States has ruled that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) broke the law by disclosing confidential taxpayer information “approximately 42,695 times” to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nIn a decision issued on Thursday, US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly found that the IRS had erroneously shared the taxpayer information of thousands of people, in apparent violation of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe ruling cited IRS Code 6103, one of the strictest confidentiality laws in federal statute, which largely prohibits the disclosure of tax return information without consent.\n\nKollar-Kotelly said that the IRS violated that law “approximately 42,695 times by disclosing last known taxpayer addresses to ICE”.\n\n“The IRS not only failed to ensure that ICE’s request for confidential taxpayer address information met the statutory requirements, but this failure led the IRS to disclose confidential taxpayer addresses to ICE in situations where ICE’s request for that information was patently deficient,” she wrote.\n\nHer finding is based on a declaration filed earlier this month by Dottie Romo, the chief risk and control officer for the IRS, which revealed that the IRS had provided the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with information on 47,000 of the 1.28 million people that ICE had requested.\n\nIn most of those cases, Romo said, the tax agency gave ICE additional address information in violation of privacy rules created to protect taxpayer data.\n\nThe government is appealing the case, but the Thursday ruling is significant because Romo’s declaration supports the decision on appeal.\n\n\n\nKollar-Kotelly, meanwhile, called the Romo declaration “a significant development in this case”.\n\nWhat agreement does the IRS have with ICE?\n\nThe case is the result of a growing effort under the administration of President Donald Trump to consolidate government data, alarming rights advocates who fear an erosion of taxpayer privacy.\n\nPart of that data has been used to carry out Trump’s campaign of mass deportation, a key pillar of his second-term agenda.\n\nOn April 7, the IRS entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security to help with “non-tax criminal enforcement”.\n\nThat agreement, however, was widely understood to be the groundwork for the identification and deportation of immigrants in the US through taxpayer data.\n\nThe Center for Taxpayer Right sued the government over the disclosure, citing protections instituted after the 1972 Watergate scandal revealed how former President Richard Nixon misused tax data during his term.\n\n“This nation already once experienced a President who sought to collect tax information on his political allies and enemies in the White House for use for favor and punishment,” the centre wrote in an initial complaint.\n\n“Following the Watergate era, Congress clearly and unequivocally acted to protect the American people from these intrusions.”\n\nIt argued that taxpayer data is uniquely sensitive and “in grave jeopardy” of being shared broadly across the government.\n\nNina Olson, founder of the Center for Taxpayer Rights, said after Thursday’s ruling, “This confirms what we’ve been saying all along: that the IRS has an unlawful policy that violates the Internal Revenue Code’s protections by releasing these addresses in a way that violates the law’s requirements.”\n\nRepresentatives from the IRS and the Department of the Treasury did not respond to The Associated Press’s requests for comment.\n\nCurrently, the data-sharing agreement allows ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the US illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.\n\nThe deal, signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, led the then-acting commissioner of the IRS to resign.\n\nThere are several ongoing cases that challenge the agreement between the IRS and immigration authorities.\n\nEarlier this week, a three-judge panel for the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit declined to issue a preliminary injunction for the immigrants’ rights group Centro de Trabajadores Unidos and other nonprofits as they sue the federal government to stop implementation of the agreement.\n\n\n\nIn declining the preliminary injunction request, Judge Harry T Edwards wrote that the nonprofit groups “are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim”, since the information the agencies are sharing isn’t covered by the IRS privacy statute.\n\nStill, two separate court orders have blocked the agencies from massive transfers of taxpayer information and blocked ICE from acting upon any IRS data in its possession. Those preliminary injunctions are still in place."

At least one Cuban officer was also hurt in the gunfire.\n\nCBS News also reported that at least one US citizen was among the dead, citing White House officials.\n\nStill, Cuban officials defended their government’s response and alleged the speedboat passengers shot first at border agents.\n\n“Cuba will defend itself with determination and firmness against any terrorist and mercenary aggression that seeks to affect its sovereignty and national stability,” Cuban President Manuel Diaz-Canel said in a social media post.\n\nThe incident comes during a period of heightened tensions between Cuba and the US, which has made repeated threats against the island’s communist government.\n\nThe administration of President Donald Trump has also ratcheted up measures meant to worsen economic conditions there, including by imposing a fuel blockade on Cuba in late January.\n\nOnly one of the four men killed has been identified by the Cuban government so far: Michel Ortega Casanova.\n\nOne of Casanova’s associates told the news service AFP that he sought to overthrow the government in Havana.\n\n“His goal was to go and fight against a criminal and murderous narco-tyrannical [government], to see if that would spark the people to rise up,” said Wilfredo Beyra, head of the Cuban Republican Party in Tampa.\n\n\n\nFamily members of Casanova said that they were not aware of his plans but that he was motivated by the “great suffering” of people under the Cuban government.\n\n“No one knew,” Misrael Ortega Casanova, his brother, said. “My mother is devastated.”\n\nHe identified his sibling as part of a group concerned about rights abuses on the island.\n\n“They became so obsessed that they didn’t think about the consequences nor their own lives,” Misrael added.\n\nUS officials have said that they will investigate the incident and denied any government involvement. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US embassy in Havana is seeking more details, including whether US citizens are among those detained.\n\n“We have various different elements of the US government that are trying to identify elements of the story that may not be provided to us now,” he said.\n\nThe US has worked with Cuban exiles against the country’s government in the past, including by supporting campaigns of clandestine infiltration, violence and sabotage.\n\nBut activist groups in South Florida have also launched their own operations, some of them running small speedboats and planes to ferry out Cuban nationals.\n\nCuban authorities have used US intervention as a pretext for the country’s steep restrictions on political dissent and a slate of security measures that rights groups say have been wielded against critics.\n\nCuban authorities identified some of this week’s speedboat passengers as Conrado Galindo Sariol, Jose Manuel Rodriguez Castello and Cristian Ernesto Acosta Guevara. More have yet to be identified.\n\nThe Cuban government also stated that some of the passengers were wanted by law enforcement authorities “based on their involvement in the promotion, planning, organisation, financing, support or commission of actions carried out in the national territory or in other countries, in connection with acts of terrorism”.\n\nMembers of the Cuban American community, however, have expressed scepticism about the Cuban government’s claims.\n\n“Nobody with a 25-foot speedboat tries to overthrow a government,” Emilio Izquierdo, a Cuban exile, told The Associated Press."

            "content": "The new announcement from Quito follows an initial 30% tariff imposed by the Andean nation in early February.\n\nClick here to share on social media\n\nThe Ecuadorian government has declared that it will significantly raise tariffs on imports from Colombia, increasing the rate from 30 percent to 50 percent starting March 1.\n\nThe decision, announced on Thursday, represents a major escalation in the intensifying trade and security dispute between the two neighbouring Andean countries.\n\nEcuador’s right-wing president, Daniel Noboa, has been pressuring his left-wing counterpart in Colombia, Gustavo Petro, to crack down on border security.\n\nSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Ecuador has seen a surge in violence linked to the expansion of organised crime in the country.\n\nNoboa, echoing President Donald Trump in the United States, has blamed Petro for not acting aggressively enough to combat narcotics trafficking. Colombia has, for many years, been the world’s largest source of cocaine.\n\nAnd like Trump, Noboa has increasingly relied on tariffs against Colombia to force adherence to Ecuador’s national security strategy.\n\nHis government has accused Petro’s of failing to cooperate with border security measures. The two countries both sit on the Pacific coast, and they share a land border that stretches roughly 586 kilometres, or 364 miles.\n\nQuestions about electricity\n\nThursday’s announcement follows an initial 30 percent tariff imposed by Quito in early February.\n\nEcuadorian officials have also justified the protectionist measures by citing a growing trade deficit.\n\nAccording to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, a data analysis firm, nearly 4 percent of Colombian exports go to Ecuador, worth roughly $2.13bn. Ecuador imports significant quantities of medicines and pesticides from Colombia.\n\n\n\nFewer exports go from Ecuador to Colombia, though. Roughly 2.3 percent of Ecuador’s exports abroad go across the shared border, amounting to a value of $863m.\n\nEcuador’s trade deficit with Colombia sits at roughly $1.03bn through 2025, according to government data, excluding oil.\n\nBut in spite of the anticipated tariff hike, it is unclear whether Ecuador will apply the new tariffs to Colombian electricity — a critical resource for the country.\n\nIn a retaliatory move following the initial tariffs, Colombia suspended all energy sales to its neighbour.\n\nThat suspension risks fuelling tensions in Ecuador against Noboa’s government. Recent droughts have created disruptions to Ecuador’s hydroelectric dams, which provide nearly 70 percent of the country’s power.\n\nThose disruptions have caused widespread power outages in recent years, which in turn have prompted antigovernment protests. In the past, Noboa has responded by buying electricity from Colombia.\n\nPipeline standoff\n\nThe transportation of fossil fuels has also become a flashpoint between Ecuador and Colombia in the aftermath of February’s tariffs.\n\nNoboa’s government has hiked fees for Colombian crude delivered through the Trans-Ecuadorian System Oil Pipeline (SOTE) by 900 percent.\n\nThat raises the cost to approximately $30 per barrel. Colombia has responded by halting all oil shipments through the line.\n\nDespite high-level diplomatic efforts, tensions between the neighbouring countries remain at an impasse.\n\nOfficials representing foreign policy and security held a meeting this month in Ecuador, but the gathering concluded without a breakthrough.\n\nIn announcing the latest tariff hike, Ecuador’s Ministry of Production and Foreign Trade levelled criticism at Colombia for failing to implement “concrete and effective” measures to curb drug trafficking along the border.\n\nOnce considered a bastion of stability, Ecuador has seen a spike in homicide and other violent crimes.\n\nAccording to the Geneva-based Organized Crime Observatory, the Andean nation recorded a homicide rate of approximately one murder every hour last year."

            "content": "One killed and 29 others wounded in latest Israeli attack in violation of ceasefire.\n\nIsraeli strikes on Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley have killed one person and wounded 29 others, the latest in a series of ceasefire violations.\n\nLebanon’s Ministry of Health announced that a “16-year-old Syrian boy was killed”, the National News Agency (NNA) reported on Thursday. He was named as Hussein Mohsen al-Khalaf and was killed in a strike on Kfar Dan near Baalbek, the L’Orient news outlet reported.\n\nAt least 13 air strikes were recorded, four in Shmestar, five in Boudai, two in Harbata and two in the Hermel and Nabi Chit mountains, according to NNA. Several shops were damaged in the Baalbek Souk in Tallet al-Ajami.\n\nThe Israeli military said it targeted eight camps belonging to Hezbollah’s special operations unit, the Radwan Force. It said weapons and missiles were stored there and training was conducted “as part of preparations for emergency situations, and to plan and execute terrorist plots”. It said this activity was a “violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon”.\n\nCeasefire violations\n\nIsrael’s military has continued to carry out attacks in Lebanon, despite a November 2024 ceasefire with the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah that sought to bring an end to more than a year of fighting. More than 300 people have been killed since then, including 127 civilians, according to the United Nations.\n\nLast week, at least 12 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the Bekaa Valley and the Ein el-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp near the city of Sidon. Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah and Hamas command centres.\n\n\n\nLebanon filed a complaint with the UN in January, detailing a total of 2,036 Israeli violations between October and December 2025 alone. It called on the UN Security Council to compel Israel to end these actions and to fully withdraw from its borders.\n\nIsrael continues to occupy parts of Lebanon, blocking the reconstruction of border villages and preventing people from returning to their homes.\n\nLebanon’s government has said it has almost completed its ceasefire commitment to disarm Hezbollah south of the Litani River. It said it will need four months to complete the second phase.\n\nHowever, Hezbollah has rejected this, saying it believes the disarmament in the ceasefire agreement only applies to areas south of the river."

            "content": "Albanese, a supporter of Palestinian rights, has faced US sanctions since July over her criticism of Israel.\n\nThe family of United Nations human rights rapporteur Francesca Albanese has sued the administration of United States President Donald Trump over the sanctions it imposed upon her.\n\nAlbanese’s husband and child filed the lawsuit on Thursday. It argues that the sanctions are an effort to punish Albanese for bringing attention to rights abuses Israel has perpetuated against Palestinians.\n\nSince 2022, Albanese, a legal scholar, has served as the special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, where she monitors human rights abuses against Palestinians. The UN Human Rights Council selected her for the position.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, sanctioned her last July, calling her “unfit” for her role and accusing her of “biased and malicious activities” against the US and its ally, Israel.\n\nIt also highlighted her work with the International Criminal Court (ICC), which — after considering the recommendations of Albanese and other experts — issued an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes in Gaza.\n\nAlbanese’s family, however, defended her comments as an expression of free speech, protected under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\n“Francesca’s expression of her views about the facts as she has found them in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and about the work of the ICC is core First Amendment activity,” the lawsuit says.\n\nA role chronicling abuses\n\nAlbanese, an Italian citizen, has long fielded criticism from the Israeli government and its allies in the US for her criticisms of the violence committed against Palestinians.\n\n\n\nHer international profile has grown since Israel launched its genocidal war on Gaza on October 8, 2023. More than 75,000 Palestinians have died in that conflict, according to experts and local health officials.\n\nIn March 2024, six months into the war, Albanese testified in a report that she had “reasonable grounds to believe” that the standards for genocide had been reached in Gaza, as outlined in the UN Genocide Convention.\n\nIsrael rejected the findings. Albanese, meanwhile, said she faced threats after making her statement to the UN.\n\nHer public role and blistering condemnation of Israeli abuses have made her a subject of frequent ire from Israeli and US authorities.\n\nBut in Thursday’s lawsuit, Albanese’s family members questioned whether US sanction power should be used to stifle allegations of human rights abuses.\n\nThey also highlighted Albanese’s situation as the mother of a US citizen.\n\n“At its heart, this case concerns whether Defendants can sanction a person — ruining their life and the lives of their loved ones, including their citizen daughter — because Defendants disagree with their recommendations or fear their persuasiveness,” the court filing said.\n\nThe US Department of State, however, has waved aside the lawsuit as “baseless lawfare”. It maintains that the sanctions against Albanese are “legal and appropriate”.\n\nA wider campaign in the US\n\nSanctions generally freeze the US-based assets of an individual and prevent anyone else in the US from doing business with them.\n\nSince returning for a second term, Trump has used sanctions as penalties for several critics of Israeli and US actions, even beyond Albanese.\n\nLast June, the Trump administration sanctioned four ICC judges for taking “illegitimate and baseless actions” against the US and Israel. Then, in August, two more ICC judges, plus two prosecutors, were also slapped with sanctions.\n\nAs recently as December, another pair of ICC judges were added to the list for their involvement in the investigation of alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza.\n\nA growing number of scholars, rights groups and international organisations have said that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide.\n\nIsrael and the US, however, have largely refuted that assessment. They have also questioned whether the ICC has jurisdiction in their countries.\n\nThough the US and Israel are not party to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding document, both have been accused of rights abuses in countries that are members.\n\nIn Albanese’s case, the US government has accused the rapporteur of anti-Semitism and criticised her for pushing for boycotts of US companies implicated in Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\n\n\n“We will not tolerate these campaigns of political and economic warfare, which threaten our national interests and sovereignty,” the US State Department said in its sanctions announcement.\n\nBut Albanese has indicated that she remains committed to her work regardless of the disruptions to her life.\n\n“My daughter is American. I’ve been living in the US, and I have some assets there. So of course, it’s going to harm me,” Albanese said after the sanctions announcement.\n\n“What can I do? I did everything I did in good faith, and knowing that, my commitment to justice is more important than personal interests.”"

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” – a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

The feature takes the load off your device using its own cloud-based computer and browser, allowing it to handle a variety of jobs ranging from scheduling appointments to generating study plans while you do something else.\n\nAs noted by Microsoft, you can describe what you need to Copilot Tasks using natural language, and assign Copilot Tasks to complete jobs on a recurring, scheduled, or one-time basis. Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

Even the controllers are convertible: the right side controller can be used as a vertical mouse in “FPS Mode,” similar to the mouse mode on the Legion Go 2 or the Nintendo Switch 2. The right-side controller also has a built-in display that shows performance metrics and settings and doubles as a touchpad.\n\nThe Legion Go Fold is rumored to include an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 48 Whr battery. According to WindowsLatest, Lenovo plans to announce it as a concept device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, although it likely wouldn’t be commercially available right away, if ever."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow? Seems like we need to ask Apple and Google why they chose differently."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop.

The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding.

It works by breathing, in a sense — oxygen pumped into the cells rusts iron, which releases electrons. The battery will work to smooth the flow of electrons from 1.4 gigawatts of wind power and 200 megawatts of solar power.\n\nThe startup has been chipping away at the technology for years, and it has built a factory in West Virginia to produce the batteries. But it hadn’t landed a major customer until this recent deal with Google.\n\nWith a big order on the books, Form Energy CEO Mateo Jaramillo said that his company is in the process of raising a $500 million round. Form has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook. The company plans to go public next year."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\n\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

            "content": "Iowa lawmakers voted to advance state House bill 751 last week, legislation that would ensure farmers in the state can freely repair their own agricultural equipment, like tractors. This Tuesday, the bill was renamed to House File 2709, and it will be voted on again. Should the political winds align, it will go through the Iowa House and Senate before the Iowa Legislature adjourns on April 21.\n\nThe bill is the first of nearly 57 state bills supported by repair advocates across the country in 2026. Many of them focus on farm equipment in states like Oklahoma, Wyoming, Delaware, and West Virginia. Repair advocates hope a win in Iowa—the second-highest-grossing state in the US for agricultural products, behind California—will help further legislative and broader efforts to make phones, cars, and other devices more repairable.\n\n“This isn't just a blue state thing; this isn't just a Colorado activist thing,” says Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability for the right-to-repair advocate arm of iFixit. “Its real. Farmers have trouble repairing their equipment and want change.”\n\nFarmers and their tractors have long been a focal point of the right-to-repair movement, the ever-growing global effort to let product owners fix their own devices and equipment without manufacturer approval. Farmers who use tractors to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops often need to repair their equipment while they work. Waiting for manufacturer approval to get something fixed, or taking the time to bring the equipment to an approved dealership, can cause delays, frustration, and missed opportunities to harvest crops.\n\nThe Iowa bill defines which agricultural equipment it covers, including tractors, trailers, combines, sprayers, balers, and other equipment used to cultivate and harvest crops. It excludes aircraft and irrigation equipment, along with jet skis and snowmobiles.\n\nManufacturers would also be required to provide owners with data—documentation, like manuals, and access to embedded operating software—on their tractors, including future patches and fixes, all without charging for it or requiring authorization for internet access. The bill also limits the use of digital locks—software restrictions that prevent accessing features without manufacturer approval.\n\nOh Deere\n\nThe most prominent opposition to the Iowa bill is tractor manufacturer John Deere, which has a long history of opposing repair efforts and frustrating farmers who want to take more control of their equipment. The company is still fighting a lawsuit the US Federal Trade Commission levied against John Deere in January 2025 for “unlawful” repairability policies. The company has lobbied against the Iowa bill and outright opposes its passing.\n\n“John Deere is steadfast in supporting farmers' ability to repair their equipment,” wrote a John Deere representative in a statement responding to WIRED’s inquiry. “And we back that up by offering industry-leading self-repair tools and resources to both equipment owners and alternative service providers.”"

It combines the abilities of Google’s previous release, Nano Banana Pro—like text rendering and web searching—with speedier image generation. This tool will be the new default in Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n\nThe first image model from Google under the Nano Banana moniker dropped last August, and the Pro version arrived three months later. The AI tool was widely adopted online to alter photos of real people, from generating custom action figures to nostalgic images of people hugging younger versions of themselves.\n\nNano Banana 2 is not only faster at crafting images, it’s also a more powerful photo editor. Despite some rough edges and unconvincing generations in my initial hands-on experience through Gemini, Google’s latest release marks the continued improvement of photorealistic AI tools that can manipulate existing images and serves as a stark reminder to always scrutinize unverified images you see online.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIf you want to try the new image model, the easiest way to access Nano Banana 2 is through the Gemini app or website. You can either click the banana emoji to generate images or just put the request in your prompts to the chatbot. This new image model is also available through Google’s Search tools, AI Studio, Cloud, and other services.\n\nGoogle says the Nano Banana 2 image generator pulls real-time information from the web, which can be useful for generating infographics. To test this, I asked Gemini to generate a custom weather report for my upcoming weekend getaway. Here’s my prompt:\n\nI'm going skiing in Dodge Ridge this weekend with some friends. Could you create an infographic that covers the weather conditions?"

It is Season 50, so we have Survivor players of eons past that are coming back to compete for the million dollars. I am so excited. It's going to be incredible. Zoë, my goal in the next few months is just to make you watch one, one, of the episodes. This is very important to me.\n\nBrian Barrett: If you were to make Zoë watch a historical episode of Survivor in isolation, what one hour of Survivor would you show her?\n\nLeah Feiger: Can I say a season, or does it have to be an episode?\n\nBrian Barrett: I want to go with that, because I don't think you're going to get her for a whole season.\n\nLeah Feiger: So I'm going to do the second-to-last episode of the Micronesia season of Survivor. Absolutely incredible season, known for the Black Widow Brigade. Zoë, I actually think you would really like it. Well, anyway, that is my WIRED. My TIRED—and I'm kind of devastated to say this—is Love Is Blind, which is ... I know that my theme was reality shows this week. Look, I have a lot of I wouldn't say love for Love Is Blind, but I have a lot of interest in Love Is Blind. I am an avid Love Is Blind watcher. I think it is a super interesting concept and a very weird show and produces a lot of very weird people. But there is a excellent WIRED article coming out about how MAGA it's gotten, and that those are the people that are going on the show right now, and the conversations that are happening between these couples who met behind a wall and are off to get married several weeks after knowing each other, the conversations are quite sad. They're making me sad. There's a lot of body shaming and it's just very—it's weird. So this season, it's not doing it for me, which that's OK, because Survivor is here to lift me out of the doldrums. That is my WIRED and TIRED. I stand by it. I swear that I read books and stuff too. I do not want this to be my only brand on this show.\n\nZoë Schiffer: Certainly not. Brian, drag us out. I need to get on firmer ground.\n\nBrian Barrett: OK. Well, I'm going to go TIRED. Samsung just announced some new phones. Those aren't TIRED, but TIRED is AI overload in phones. There's too much. So at this point, the new Samsung Galaxy S26 smartphones—similar to Google's conversational photo editor—they have a photo assist thing that lets you use natural language, so you can just type in. If you have a photo that you took, you can say like, \"Hey, give my dog a party hat,\" and then there will be a party hat on the dog. What's the point of taking photos anymore? Why not just prompt something instead from scratch, or just go touch some grass? I am curious about—they've got agents built into the phone, so you can use the phone. You can just say, \"Hey, order me a pizza,\" and the phone will just do that for you. We'll see if it works. I don't know. It seems like it might go off the rails. Anyway, too much too soon for me. That's my TIRED. I didn't plan a WIRED. I was so caught up on the phone, but because it came up earlier, I'll say the new Muppet Show episode with Sabrina Carpenter is really quite good, and I hope that it got a good enough response that Disney makes more of them."

            "content": "AI agents like OpenClaw have recently exploded in popularity precisely because they can take the reins of your digital life. Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers.\n\nToday, anyone can ask DeepSeek or Qwen a question about the Tiananmen Square Massacre and immediately see censorship is happening, but it’s hard to tell how much it impacts normal users and how to properly identify the source of the manipulation. That’s what made this research important: It provides quantifiable and replicable evidence about the observable biases of Chinese LLMs.\n\nBeyond discussing their findings, I asked the authors about their methods and the challenges of studying biases in Chinese models, and spoke with other researchers to understand where the AI censorship debate is heading.\n\nWhat You Don’t Know\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying AI models is that they have a tendency to hallucinate, so you can’t always tell if they are lying because they know not to say the correct answer or because they actually don’t know it.\n\nOne example Pan cited from her paper was a question aboutLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. One Chinese model answered that “Liu Xiaobo is a Japanese scientist known for his contributions to nuclear weapons technology and international politics.” That is, of course, a complete lie. But why did the model tell it? Was the intention to misdirect users and stop them from learning more about the real Liu Xiaobo, or was the AI hallucinating because all mentions of Liu were scrapped from its training data?\n\n“It's much noisier of a measure of censorship,” Pan says, comparing it to her previous work researching Chinese social media and what websites the Chinese government chooses to block. “Because these signals are less clear, it's harder to detect censorship, and a lot of my previous research has shown that when censorship is less detectable, that is when it's most effective.”"

            "content": "Silicon Valley has always prized “high-agency” individuals—people who impress their ideas upon the world by thinking for themselves and taking action without being told what to do. But as the performance of AI coding tools has surged, so has the industry’s emphasis on humans being \"agentic\" themselves.\n\n“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion. “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.”\n\nThat idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley. A viral Harper's essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity.\n\nSimon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain.\n\n“Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.”"

It has not indicated how many researchers it will hire.\n\n“The UK brings together world-class talent and leading scientific institutions and universities, making it an ideal place to deliver the important research which will ensure our AI is safe, useful, and benefits everyone,” said Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nThe plans bring OpenAI into direct competition for top research talent with Google DeepMind, the AI lab run by British researcher Demis Hassabis, which is headquartered in London. DeepMind has long-running partnerships with Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, where it sponsors professorships, funds research, and works alongside researchers.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former AI researcher who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at Joel_Khalili.28.\n\nAt the latest careers fair at Oxford University, the floor was packed with undergraduates looking for technical roles and recruiters hiring for AI-related positions. “The demand and supply is increasing on both sides, even within a year,” says Jonathan Black, director of the careers service at Oxford University. “To have something like this turn up is a really positive sign.”\n\nOpenAI’s expansion in London could have a sort-of flywheel effect, whereby the researchers it hires early in their careers go on to start new labs in the UK, says Tom Wilson, partner at venture capital firm Seedcamp. “We’ve seen many examples over the years,” he says. “That’s where these kinds of announcements can have even more impact than the initial hires … the second-order effects can be great.”"

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."

The streaming giant said it \"had declined to raise its offer\" after Paramount submitted a revised all-cash bid of $31 per share on Tuesday to buy WBD in its entirety. WBD had reviewed the rival offer and announced that its board of directors found it \"superior\" to the Netflix agreement.\n\nNetflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement: \"At the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say: \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US.\"\n\nHowever, according to Netflix, the transaction was more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" at any price.\n\nIf approved, Paramount's new bid would see it not only pay $31 per share in cash, but also be on the hook for a $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe Netflix for backing out of its agreement. Additionally, Paramount would also be responsible for paying \"a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after Sept. 30, 2026,\" according to WBD, and pony up $7 billion should the deal not pass regulatory requirements.\n\nParamount's deal is backed by cash from Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nThe merger-acquisition plan between Netflix and WBD was originally announced on Dec. 5 for $83 billion (stocks and cash). The deal has since seen several takeover bids from Paramount, prompting Netflix to switch to an all-cash deal in January while Paramount engaged in a back-and-forth to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe announcement arrives on the day of WBD's Q4 earnings call, and the same day that Netflix's Sarandos visited Washington, DC, to meet with officials amid the Paramount bid.\n\nCNET's Corinne Reichert also contributed to this report."

Instagram owner Meta said on Thursday that it's rolling out the new notifications to parents in the US, UK, Australia and Canada, with other regions to follow later this year.\n\nThursday's update follows the 2024 introduction of teen accounts. It applies to parents using the platform's optional parental supervision setting, which requires consent from both teens and their parents to participate. Parental supervision allows parents to see the accounts their teen follows, set a time limit for how long their teen can use the app and more.\n\nIf teens repeatedly make suicide-related searches, parents will receive alerts via in-app notifications and email, text or WhatsApp, depending on available contact information. In addition to informing parents of their teen's searches, notifications will allow them to \"view expert resources designed to help them approach potentially sensitive conversations with their teen,\" according to Meta.\n\nAn example of the alerts. Meta\n\nMeta said it would prompt an alert if a teen attempted to search for phrases promoting suicide or self-harm and phrases that suggest a teen wants to harm themselves. The company said its policy is to block searches for self-harm and suicide content and direct people to resources and helplines.\n\nThis move by Instagram is just one of many digital safety measures aimed at protecting young people online. It comes as governments push their own guardrails: Australia recently enacted the world's first ban on social media accounts for children under 16, and the United Kingdom is considering similar restrictions. These efforts reflect a broader trend toward embedding protective technologies and policies around young people and their online use, even as debates about privacy, autonomy, and effectiveness continue."

            "content": "Samsung has introduced three new S26 handsets at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year: the S26, the S26 Plus and the uber premium S26 Ultra. The S26 Ultra continues the company's tradition of Ultra handsets that offer top-of-the-line features that are lacking from the rest of their respective series. And this year, the Ultra's Privacy Display is the clear highlight feature, allowing you to customize how visible your phone is to others around you.\n\nAside from that, the S26 Ultra's other improvements are somewhat marginal. Yes, it's now made out of aluminum, the screen is a touch bigger, a 16GB RAM option is available, the processor is improved and the charging speeds are faster, but the rest of the S26 Ultra's features are similar to that of the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Even the price remains the same at $1,300.\n\nHere is how the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra compares with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nWatch this: First Look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra: Camera, Battery and AI Updates 02:56\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra only has a marginally larger screen compared to the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra have 6.8-inch AMOLED screens with 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution, while the new S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display also with a 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution. All three screens have a 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nBut it's the pixel-level Privacy Display that's particularly impressive with the S26 Ultra. When activated, the display will remain visible when looking directly at the phone while making it difficult to impossible to see what's on screen from the side. In addition to letting you turn the feature on and off for different apps, you can even have the Privacy Display activate exclusively for notifications while keeping the rest of the screen plainly visible.\n\nThe S26 Ultra's screen uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 cover glass, while the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra both use Gorilla Glass Armor. Gorilla Glass Armor 2 is said to be more scratch and drop resistant compared to its earlier version.\n\nSize-wise, the S26 Ultra is a touch bigger but also a touch thinner compared to its predecessors. CNET Senior Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti describes the new design as feeling thinner and lighter than prior Ultra phones during her hands-on time. It measures 6.44 by 3.07 by 0.31 inches, while the S25 Ultra's dimensions are 6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and the S24 Ultra measures 6.4 by 3.11 by 0.34 inches. Also, the S26 Ultra has an aluminum frame. That's a departure from the titanium frame found on both the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nThe cameras on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCameras\n\nWhile the S26 Ultra certainly has the best camera hardware of the S26 lineup, it has the same exact camera specs as its predecessors. All three Ultra phones have four cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto. That said, the S26 Ultra does have larger apertures and to capture better low-light photos. They also all have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nMany of the S26 Ultra's camera upgrades come from software. There's the Horizontal Lock feature that'll keep the horizon steady while shooting video, selfies can now capture more natural skin tones and screenshots will now be sorted into its own categories within the Gallery.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nBattery, processor and RAM\n\nAll three Ultra phones have a 5,000 mAh battery, but the charging speeds differ. The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra have 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, while the new S26 Ultra has 60W of wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Just like the S25 Ultra, the S26 Ultra does not include magnets but can support magnetic charging accessories when using a case that includes them.\n\nThe processors in the Ultra phones also get progressively faster and more efficient with each generation. The S24 Ultra has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the S25 Ultra uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and the S26 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy.\n\nWhile all three Ultra handsets come in three storage capacity options -- 256GB, 512GB and 1TB -- the S26 Ultra is the only one with a 16GB RAM option. (This ships with the 512GB and 1TB options.) The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra only ship with 12GB of RAM.\n\nCheck out the below chart to compare more details between the S26 Ultra, S25 Ultra and S24 Ultra."

            "content": "Dell sells a wide variety of laptops, and many models are available in multiple configurations to match your performance and budget needs. If you need help finding the right Dell laptop, we can help. Here are the main considerations to keep in mind when shopping for a new laptop.\n\nPrice\n\nThe search for a new laptop for most people starts with price. If the statistics chipmaker Intel and PC manufacturers hurl at us are correct, you'll be holding onto your next laptop for at least three years. If you can afford to stretch your budget a little to get better specs, do it. That stands whether you're spending $500 or more than $1,000. In the past, you could get away with spending less upfront with an eye toward upgrading memory and storage in the future. Laptop makers are increasingly moving away from making components easily upgradable, so again, it's best to get as much laptop capability as you can afford from the start.\n\nGenerally speaking, the more you spend, the better the laptop. That could mean better components for faster performance, a nicer display, sturdier build quality, a smaller or lighter design from higher-end materials or even a more comfortable keyboard. All of these things add to the cost of a laptop. I'd love to say $500 will get you a powerful gaming laptop, for example, but that's not the case. Right now, the sweet spot for a reliable laptop that can handle average work, home office or school tasks is between $700 and $800, and a reasonable model for creative work or gaming is upward of about $1,000. The key is to look for discounts on models in all price ranges so you can get more laptop capability for less. Like other vendors, Dell is constantly running sales on laptops on its site.\n\nSize\n\nIf you'll be taking your laptop with you to class or work or just down to your local coffee shop most mornings, then you'll want a smaller and lighter laptop -- something with a 13-inch or 14-inch screen. If you're buying a laptop for your home or work and don't plan on traveling with it with any great frequency, then it might serve you well to get a larger 15-inch, 16-inch or even a 17-inch display that gives you more room to work, play and multitask.\n\nDisplay\n\nWhen deciding on a display, there are many considerations: How much you need to display (which is surprisingly more about resolution than screen size), what types of content you'll be looking at, and whether you'll be using it for gaming or creative endeavors.\n\nYou really want to optimize pixel density; that is, the number of pixels per inch the screen can display. Although other factors contribute to sharpness, a higher pixel density usually means sharper rendering of text and interface elements. (You can easily calculate the pixel density of any screen at DPI Calculator if you don't feel like doing the math, and you can also find out what math you need to do there.) We recommend a dot pitch of at least 100 pixels per inch as a rule of thumb.\n\nBecause of the way Windows can scale the display, you're frequently better off with a higher resolution than you'd think. You can always make things bigger on a high-resolution screen, but you can never make them smaller -- to fit more content in the view -- on a low-resolution screen. This is why a 4K, 14-inch screen may sound like unnecessary overkill, but may not be if you need to, say, view a wide spreadsheet.\n\nText and the edges of images can look fuzzy on a lower-resolution display. Look for a Full HD 1,920x1,080-pixel resolution at a minimum -- or a 1,920x1,200-pixel resolution on laptops with 16:10 aspect ratios that are taller than traditional 16:9 widescreen displays and provide more vertical screen space for work without significantly increasing the footprint. A Quad HD resolution of 2,560x1,440 pixels (2,560x1,600 on a 16:10 display) will result in crisper text and images and will likely suffice on a 13- or 14-inch laptop display -- you don't necessarily need a 4K display.\n\nProcessor\n\nThe processor, aka the CPU, is the brain of a laptop. Intel and AMD are the main CPU makers for Windows laptops, with Qualcomm as a new third option with its Arm-based Snapdragon X processors. Both Intel and AMD offer a staggering selection of mobile processors. Making things trickier, both manufacturers have chips designed for different laptop styles, like power-saving chips for ultraportables or faster processors for gaming laptops. Their naming conventions will let you know what type is used. You can head to Intel's or AMD's sites for explanations so you get the performance you want. Generally speaking, the faster the processor speed and the more cores it has, the better the performance will be.\n\nBattery life has less to do with the number of cores and more to do with CPU architecture, Arm versus x86. Apple’s Arm-based MacBooks and the first Arm-based Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested offer better battery life than laptops based on x86 processors from Intel and AMD.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe graphics processor, or GPU, handles all the work of driving the screen and generating what gets displayed, as well as speeding up a lot of graphics-related (and increasingly, AI-related) operations. For Windows laptops, there are two types of GPUs: integrated or discrete. As the names imply, an iGPU is part of the CPU package, while a dGPU is a separate chip with dedicated memory (VRAM) that it communicates with directly, making it faster than sharing memory with the CPU.\n\nBecause the iGPU splits space, memory and power with the CPU, it's constrained by the limits of those. It allows for smaller, lighter laptops, but doesn't perform nearly as well as a dGPU. There are some games and creative software that won't run unless they detect a dGPU or sufficient VRAM. Most productivity software, video streaming, web browsing and other nonspecialized apps will run fine on an iGPU, though.\n\nFor more power-hungry graphics needs, like video editing, STEM and design applications as well as gaming, you'll need a dGPU; there are only two real companies that make them, Nvidia and AMD, with Intel offering some based on the Xe-branded (or the older UHD Graphics branding) iGPU technology in its CPUs.\n\nMemory\n\nFor memory, we highly recommend 16GB of RAM, with 8GB being the absolute bare minimum. RAM is where the operating system stores all the data for currently running applications, and it can fill up fast. After that, it starts swapping between RAM and SSD, which is slower. A lot of sub-$500 laptops have 4GB or 8GB, which, in conjunction with a slower disk, can make for a frustratingly slow Windows laptop experience. Also, many laptops now have the memory soldered onto the motherboard. Most manufacturers disclose this, but if the RAM type is LPDDR, assume it's soldered and can't be upgraded.\n\nSome PC makers will solder memory on and leave an empty internal slot for adding a stick of RAM. You may need to contact the laptop manufacturer or find the laptop's full specs online to confirm. Check the web for user experiences, because the slot may still be hard to get to, it may require nonstandard or hard-to-get memory or other pitfalls, including voiding the warranty.\n\nStorage\n\nYou'll still find cheaper hard drives in budget laptops and larger hard drives in gaming laptops, but faster solid-state drives have all but replaced hard drives in laptops. They can make a big difference in performance. Not all SSDs are equally speedy, and cheaper laptops typically have slower drives. If the laptop only has 8GB of RAM, it may end up swapping to that drive, and the system may slow down quickly while you're working.\n\nGet what you can afford, and if you need to go with a smaller drive, you can always add an external drive or two down the road, or use cloud storage to bolster a small internal drive. The one exception is gaming laptops: We don't recommend going with less than a 512GB SSD unless you really like uninstalling games every time you want to play a new game."
