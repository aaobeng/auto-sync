The Ineos owner purchased a stake in the club two years ago and has attempted to cut the club’s cloth accordingly.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere have been two rounds of major redundancies at the club, while staff perks have also been slashed. Despite those brutal decisions, the club’s debt continues to rise under its current ownership.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to the club’s latest accounts, United’s total amount of borrowing sits at a staggering £777million. £295m worth of that is payable within one year.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nElsewhere, the Red Devils also owe a further £422m in transfer fee instalments for incoming recruitment. Worryingly, £238m is due within the year.\n\nCombined, that puts United’s debt at a total of around £1.3billion. On the club’s latest results, CEO Omar Berrada said: \"We are now seeing the positive financial impact of our off-pitch transformation materialise both in our costs and profitability.\n\nView 2 Images Jim Ratcliffe has been forced to cut costs at Manchester United (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

And I've probably failed on the having fun front. I mean, I can put up with it for a while. I don't mind being unpopular because I get that nobody likes seeing Manchester United down where they are, and nobody likes the decisions we're having to make at the moment.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"If I draw a bit of the ire, I can put up with that. But I'm no different to the average person. It's not nice, particularly for friends and family.

We bought in and I haven't seen them since.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It's, 'Thank you, Jim, you're doing a really good job.' At the moment, I don't have security, I don't have to walk around like that. But it would defeat the object, wouldn't it? You couldn't tolerate it at that level, it just wouldn't be fun.\"\n\nUnited currently sit fourth in the Premier League after a season in which they have sacked Ruben Amorim.

Kasper Hjulmand’s side had finished 16th in the league phase table previously.\n\nAtalanta, in contrast, made harder work of their progression to the last-16, having lost their first-leg fixture away at Dortmund 2-0.

Following an eventful week of knockout play-off drama, the final 16 clubs have now been confirmed.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe seeded Blues were able to sit this stage out - having finished sixth during the league phase - but the draw has left them with two possible matchups, neither of which are particularly inviting. Chelsea will face either a fiery all-English showdown with Newcastle or a headline-grabbing encounter against reigning champions PSG.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNewcastle booked their place in the last 16 with a dominant 9-3 aggregate win over Qarabag, while PSG squeezed past Monaco 5-4 over two legs in a thrilling all-French battle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea will be paired with one of those sides, while the other will meet Barcelona.

After a chaotic opening leg, Luis Enrique's men were pushed to the limit by Monaco, even though they spent significant periods of both matches playing against 10 men.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey sit two points ahead of Lens at the Ligue 1 summit and are widely expected to secure a fifth consecutive domestic crown. However, their recent performances have been somewhat inconsistent. PSG closed out the Champions League group phase with two losses and two draws from five matches and they have also suffered domestic defeats to Rennes and local rivals Paris FC in recent weeks.\n\nEven so, the squad is packed with elite-level quality. Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Desire Doue - who scored twice in the first leg against Monaco - and Bradley Barcola make up one of the most dangerous forward lines in the game. With Vitinha, Joao Neves and Nuno Mendes orchestrating play behind them, PSG possess the quality and firepower to punish any opponent.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea beat PSG in the final of the Club World Cup last year (Image: getty)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere are, however, weaknesses at the back. They have shipped eight goals in their last four matches in all competitions and have managed just two clean sheets in Europe this term.\n\nChelsea will also draw confidence from their emphatic victory over PSG in the Club World Cup final last year. Few expected the Blues to prevail, yet they produced a superb display to claim a convincing 3-0 win and lift the trophy in style.\n\nOption 2: Newcastle\n\nAlthough Newcastle currently sit 11th in the Premier League table, they have looked transformed on the continental stage this season. They tore Qarabag apart in the play-offs, virtually settling the tie with a 6-1 first-leg rout before completing the job with a 3-2 success in the return fixture.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDuring the group phase, they registered victories over Benfica, PSV and Athletic Bilbao, and earned away draws against PSG and Bayer Leverkusen. That said, their domestic results have been disappointing recently. Eddie Howe's side have been beaten in four of their last five league outings - and six of their last nine matches in all competitions.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea haven't the strongest of record against Newcastle recently (Image: getty)\n\nStill, Newcastle won't be pushovers. Chelsea are well aware of the intensity, physical battles and the electric environment at St James' Park that will come with drawing the Magpies. While league consistency has deserted them, European nights appear to inspire them - particularly the likes of Anthony Gordon and Bruno Guimaraes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nChelsea's recent record against Newcastle since the PIF takeover is also concerning. The Blues have failed to win any of their last three meetings with the Toon and have claimed only three victories from their past nine encounters overall - with one of those successes requiring extra time.\n\nOn the other hand, Chelsea will believe they can find the net against Newcastle, who have conceded 17 goals in their last eight matches in all competitions. Notably, if the draw pairs the two sides together, they would meet three times within a week, as their upcoming Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge would fall between the two European legs.\n\nView 4 Images Chelsea will face either PSG or Newcastle (Image: Dave Winter/Shutterstock)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nFOLLOW OUR CHELSEA FB PAGE! Latest Blues news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nVerdict\n\nUltimately, PSG would represent the more daunting prospect for Chelsea. Newcastle pose a threat, but Chelsea would likely enter that tie as favourites given their stronger league form and greater squad depth. It would also mark the Blues' first European meeting with Premier League opposition since their victory over Manchester City in the 2021 Champions League final.\n\nPSG, by contrast, offer a different level of challenge. They are the defending champions, boast recent experience of lifting the trophy and have match-winners across the pitch capable of changing a contest instantly.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAn away night at St James' Park is never easy, but travelling to Paris to take on the holders is the scenario Chelsea will hope to avoid when the draw is made tomorrow."

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

George has got the team around him. Kimi [Antonelli] will be stronger this year in the other car, but George is completely out of Lewis [Hamilton]'s shadow there, he's the king of the castle at Mercedes-Benz.\n\n\"He did all those years at Williams and then he went to Mercedes when they just stopped dominating, so he's done the hard yards.\n\n\"I think he's got the experience, he's got the car control, and I think he will command the respect in the team to help drive what's going to be an incredibly changeable year.\"\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Craig Slater and Martin Brundle review and rank all the F1 teams after pre-season testing\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Sky Sports News, Brundle added: \"I think his team-mate Kimi Antonelli will have a great season as well, but George has got all the confidence he needs to win races and to go and win a championship, if it's available to him.\n\n\"We questioned that with Lando [Norris] last year, and Oscar [Piastri] too, whether they would wilt under pressure from Max [Verstappen], and they didn't.\n\n\"I think George is in a very good place.\"\n\nAsked how Russell would handle any increased intra-Mercedes challenge from team-mate Kimi Antonelli, the 19-year-old Italian entering his second year of F1, Brundle added: \"Remember, [Russell] grew up in Lewis Hamilton's shadow at Mercedes, and he handled that, and eventually in the final year they were team-mates, he beat Lewis clearly.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Russell admits his two starts in Bahrain have been 'worse' than his worst-ever start in Formula 1\n\n\"So, I have no doubts about him whatsoever. They're all world-class drivers in F1, you've got to beat them somehow.\n\n\"I think George has got so much experience now despite not being 30 yet, that I don't think anything will distract him if he's got a championship-winning car.\"\n\n'No clear favourite' - Brundle expects open 'big-four' battle\n\nWhile Mercedes may be favourites for both titles heading into the 24-race campaign, Brundle believes they will face a challenge from all three of their established rivals on the evidence of the three winter tests.\n\n\"I see Ferrari being strong, I see both Ferrari drivers being strong,\" said Brundle.\n\n\"I think both McLaren drivers will be strong as well. Oscar will come back on a mission after what he learned last year; Lando, I don't think I've ever seen him yet not with that big grin on his face so far this year, he's just got that comfort now.\n\n\"The Red Bull looks really strong, and we know how Max's car control, which you'll need with these cars, will be incredible.\n\n\"So, for me, there's not a clear favourite.\"\n\nWatch every race of the 2026 Formula 1 season live on Sky Sports, starting with the Australian Grand Prix from March 6-8.

            "content": "Football's lawmakers are expected to discuss the idea of a new five-second time limit for goal-kicks and throw-ins, which could put an end to the current long-throw trend in the Premier League.\n\nThey are also expected to increase the scope of VAR to include decisions on second yellow cards, when they meet in Wales on Saturday - with further proposals to crack down on time-wasting also on the agenda.\n\nIf a new five-second time limit is introduced for goal-kicks and throw-ins, it is thought that would effectively mean an end to the increasing trend in the Premier League and EFL for teams to use long-throws as an attacking tactic.\n\nThe International Football Association Board (IFAB) which is made up of the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs together with FIFA, holds its AGM each spring. Only at this meeting can the laws of the game be amended, and they then have to be applied worldwide.\n\nHowever, the IFAB board may decide to trial some law changes rather than introduce them permanently, with those laws made optional for individual competitions to consider implementing. While any law changes will not come into effect until July 1 (so, effectively for the start of the next domestic football season) it is likely that FIFA will choose to introduce some of them, as a trial, during this summer's World Cup in North America.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Enable Cookies Allow Cookies Once\n\nInsiders think the VAR change to include second yellow cards will be passed without much opposition, meaning incorrect decisions like the one which saw Wily Boly sent off for Nottingham Forest last season against Bournemouth could be overturned by the officials in Stockley Park.\n\nCurrently, the VAR is not allowed to look at whether a second yellow card is valid or not.\n\nMore controversially, IFAB will also discuss whether the VAR can adjudicate over whether a corner should be awarded or not.\n\nIt is thought FIFA is in favour of this move, and may look to introduce it for the World Cup, although the home nations are generally more opposed to the idea, Sky Sports News has been told, for fear it will lead to more unpopular match interruptions for fans. Currently, the Premier League has the lowest intervention rates for VAR of any of the 'big five' European leagues.\n\nFA chief executive Mark Bullingham has spoken publicly about his dislike for the idea, but Pierluigi Collina, FIFA's head of referees, is a strong advocate, arguing that VAR would only get involved in corners where there has been a clear and obvious error.\n\nThere is widespread belief in the game that the introduction of the 'eight-second rule' for goalkeepers has been a success in cracking down on time-wasting - largely because there have been very few incidents this season where a 'keeper has held the ball for more than eight seconds, and a corner has been awarded to the opponent as a result.\n\nBecause of that success, IFAB will discuss further measures to speed up stoppages in play.\n\nHow would the 'five-second' rule work?\n\nProposals include introducing a new 'five-second rule' for goal-kicks and throw-ins, whereby a player will have only a very short time to get the game back under way again, or face a penalty. If they go beyond the five seconds, the throw-in would be reversed and awarded to the opponent, and a goal-kick would become a corner for the attacking side.\n\nSome insiders have suggested that five seconds is too short a time for players to adhere to, and others fear long throws would be impossible to organise in that time-frame.\n\nSome referees are also likely to be concerned that, if they have to do visual countdowns for goalkeepers with the ball in-hand, and also for throw-ins and goal-kicks, that could cause too much distraction from their other match-ruling functions.\n\nOther laws on the IFAB agenda include the mandatory 30 seconds that a player must remain off the pitch once they have received treatment for an injury on it.\n\nThere is a proposal that this time should be doubled to one minute, to help player welfare, but also to act as a further deterrent to would-be time-wasters. Similarly, a time limit for substitutions could be introduced to try to help further speed up the game.\n\nAgain, the feeling among the home nations FAs seems to be that the 30-second rule for players receiving treatment is working effectively at present, and so there may be some resistance to this law being introduced, we are told.\n\nEach law change, after discussion, will be put to the vote on Saturday. There needs to be a 75 per cent majority for any proposal to be passed. Each of the home nation FAs has one vote each, with FIFA having four votes, meaning six of the eight votes has to be in favour, for a law to be amended."

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three away games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on a direct rival. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in match-day chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) and sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL translators will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland. Louise Taylor\n\nLeeds v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Daniel Farke will be hoping for more celebration as Manchester City come to Elland Road. Photograph: Bruce Rollinson/PA\n\n7 Hürzeler seeks home approval from fans\n\nGiven supporters were calling for his head after their insipid defeat by Crystal Palace the last time Brighton played at home, Fabian Hürzeler will be relieved that last week’s victory at Brentford has eased some concerns over relegation. Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track following a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croatian’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to firstly avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge for the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes following the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "It is a peculiarity particular to Crystal Palace that a season of such upheaval and unrest could still end up with Oliver Glasner’s side winning another trophy. Having left the pitch after last week’s first leg with supporters calling for the Austrian manager to be sacked in the morning, Maxence Lacroix and Evann Guessand made it a much more harmonious evening for Glasner and his side.\n\nAfter being fortunate to escape from last week’s trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a 1-1 draw, it could have been very different if Zrinjski Mostar had equalised just before Guessand settled the tie late on. But having been demoted from the Europa League to the Conference League after winning the FA Cup last season, Palace’s first European campaign will continue against either the Cypriot side Larnaca – who they lost to during the group stages – or Mainz from Germany in the last 16.\n\n“There is so much noise, so sometimes we really don’t understand it, but maybe I gave some interviews that were not really helpful, I have to admit,” said Glasner in reference to his comments after the first leg when he told fans to “stay humble”.\n\n“I just had to express it otherwise I would have exploded. I can’t do it differently. If I feel something, I have to say it. Then I have to face the shitstorm. Everyone hopefully knows everything I say and do is for the best of Crystal Palace.”\n\nPalace rejected a request from the supporters’ group responsible for the banner directed against Glasner and the club’s board in their last match against Wolves to turn off the music so they could “back the team during the pre-match warm-up” on the grounds that Uefa’s regulations wouldn’t allow it.\n\nBut the presence of a large group of travelling supporters who took up position two hours before kick-off helped to create a decent atmosphere despite a large number of empty seats in the home sections. “40 quid? Palace fans fleeced = empty seats,” read the latest message that was displayed by the Holmesdale Fanatics during the first half.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon.

Guessand, who was starting for only the second time since his loan move from Aston Villa after scoring the decisive goal against Wolves, could not take advantage of a mix-up between the goalkeeper Goran Karacic and Igor Savic before the latter blocked Daichi Kamada’s goalbound shot.\n\nView image in fullscreen Crystal Palace fans display a banner protesting against ticket prices. Photograph: David Klein/Reuters\n\nThe Palace fans were starting to get on the Portuguese referee’s back after a series of decisions went against their side, with Jaydee Canvot and Strand Larsen both cautioned.\n\nBut in a season where defending set pieces has proved to be a major weakness, Glasner punched the air in delight when Adam Wharton’s pinpoint free-kick was headed in by Lacroix.\n\nThe England midfielder has been showing signs of fatigue in recent weeks but is still capable of providing real quality, as well as the occasional mistake. It was Wharton’s slip that allowed Leo Mikic a first sight of goal for Zrinjski just before half-time but his shot was jeered as it sailed wide.\n\nWharton was withdrawn not long after he had been shown a yellow card for a high boot, with Glasner revealing afterwards that the fourth official had warned he was close to a second booking. “Him and Will Hughes are rotating themselves by fouling too much,” he said.\n\nIsmaïla Sarr headed well over from Tyrick Mitchell’s cross in a rare sight of goal as another of Palace’s issues this season – struggling to break down teams employing a low block – returned. Their best chance of extending the lead was from another set piece and Chris Richards should have done better from close range on two occasions from a couple of Kamada free-kicks.\n\nView image in fullscreen Evann Guessand doubles Crystal Palace’s lead in stoppage time. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters\n\nThere was a warning for Palace that the tie wasn’t over when Zrinjski had a goal correctly ruled out for offside with 25 minutes still to play. Yet it was the hosts who should have wrapped up the victory as the chances came thick and fast. Guessand had a golden opportunity to settle it but saw his shot saved by Karacic and Sarr was also guilty of missing two chances that looked easier to score.\n\nZrinjski’s big moment came in the second minute of injury time but the substitute Tomi Juric could only head over before Guessand finally made sure to send Palace into the next round."

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were more than double the ­second-worst in Europe, the £171m posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while they have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculates that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s ­Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by the investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front-of-shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional ­suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s ­biggest financial losers are Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side are also owned by BlueCo and have spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

            "content": "The Premier League is to launch its own streaming service, with live coverage of all 380 matches over a season available directly to fans – but only if you live in Singapore.\n\nKnown as Premier League Plus, the new app will be launched before next season and will be the first time match coverage will be sold direct to consumers.\n\nDescribed by the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, as simply being a “learning” opportunity, the move will still cause shockwaves throughout the game as the world’s biggest domestic football league moves to directly control its revenues without the need for a broadcast partner.\n\n“From next season onward, from August, Premier League Plus is going to happen,” Masters said. “For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

Andrew McQueen, 52, was returning from a trip to Peppa Pig World with Poppy, 10. He hit a pothole in his His DB9 on the A346 through Saverake Forest outside Marlborough, in Wiltshire.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe huge pothole took the entire front wheel off his \"dream car\" - which Andrew said is now likely to be written off. Wiltshire Council have now said it will complete \"emergency repair works\" in the area. Andrew said: \"My daughter and I had such a lovely day together and were on our way home when I saw these craters - you couldn't even call them potholes - in the road.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"There wasn't just one, there were loads of them in one big clump all over the road for a few hundred yards. It didn't matter if you were going left or right, you were going through them.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images\n\nThe furniture designer from Tetbury, Glo., said that by the time he had seen the pothole, he was already going through it at 40mph. He said: \"I had no real route to get around it, so when we hit the crater I was trying to break and turn at the time but it was useless as I just would have hit another one\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"There was a gigantic bang which made the whole car shudder and we were zig-zagging a couple hundreds yards down the road with no breaks because they had been ripped out. Thankfully the car behind us stopped - we were lucky to be alive because we could have hit oncoming traffic or a tree.\"\n\nThe pair were left shaken up and had to wait several hours in the dark for a mechanic to come and collect them and bring them back home. Andrew said what made him angry was how his daughter broke down in the car after the accident.\n\nView 4 Images\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe said: \"We were all shook up and I had hurt my shoulder fighting with the steering wheel, thankfully my daughter wasn't hurt but what made me angry was when she started crying in the back of the car on the way home. She said to me that it was 'all her fault because she made us go to Pepper Pig World and now my Aston martin was written off and it was my dream car.\n\n\"We had some great memories in the car and I've wanted one since I was a child, but honestly when it sunk in later that night I was just thinking how lucky we were to have not been killed or have ended up in hospital!\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe dad-of-one said he is hoping to raise awareness of the roads and has emailed his MP and put pressure on Wiltshire council to fix them. He added: \"The more people that know about it the better so they can avoid the road and get it fixed.\n\nView 4 Images\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"It doesn't matter what car you've got - we all pay our road so why haven't they looked after these roads? I was more concerned with getting my daughter back to school and I'm just happy we are all safe.

We are aware of the condition of the A346 and will be carrying out emergency repair works in the area where this incident occurred.\""

For ITV's Doctor Amir Khan, he previously admitted there's a certain kind he would \"never\" recommend people use, as he thinks it can lead to risky consequences.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe health guru shared the expert advice in a previous episode of the No Appointment Necessary Podcast, which he hosts with presenter Cherry Healey. At the time, they were talking about sleep, and how people can struggle to get a good night's rest but, according to the GP, there's something you should try to avoid when attempting to doze off.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt's not the only vital guidance to be shared on the topic either. It's also been revealed there's a simple technique you can use that can help you get off to sleep easily too.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a clip shared on social media, the doctor was asked when a person should turn to sleeping pills for help. He replied: \"I would say never. Never, ever use sleeping tablets.\n\n\"There'll be lots of people watching this going 'well, I've got insomnia, I need sleeping tablets'. Actually, what you need is probably cognitive behavioural therapy and psychiatric input to look at why you're not sleeping and what can be done.\n\n\"The only time I might, and this is so rare, give out sleeping tablets is if there has been an acute situation, like you've had a death in the family or you've been through a very traumatic incident, and you can't sleep.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I will never give them out for more than a week because they're so addictive, you can build up a tolerance to them and the quality of sleep you have on sleeping tablets, you don't get into that deep REM sleep that you need to feel fully refreshed. \"\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nIt turns out, sometimes, sleeping tablets can actually lead to doing more harm than good. This is why the doctor is so cautious about prescribing them.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nWhile doctors occasionally prescribe sleeping pills for people in severe need of them, they should only ever be used on a short-term basis. They can sometimes be a temporary measure to aid the problem, and are usually only issued for around a week or so, under a doctor's supervision.\n\nThey aren't considered a long-term solution to sleep issues. Even though they can be effective for initiating sleep, long-term use can cause dependency, tolerance and even daytime drowsiness.\n\nIf you suffer with something like insomnia, lifestyle changes and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) are preferred first-line treatments.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPeople are not advised to use sleeping pills without speaking to a doctor first, as the medication may not be right for you, or there may be better ways of managing symptoms. Don't use over-the-counter options without contacting your GP first.\n\nIf you are prescribed them, there's no need to be afraid of using them though. You just need to ensure you approach taking them with caution, and be aware of their potential risks.\n\nWhile they can be effective for short-term relief of insomnia, both prescription and over-the-counter options also come with significant, well-documented risks. This is why they should never be used long-term.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIf you're concerned about your level of sleep, contact your doctor for further advice.

According to the expert, your body undergoes several changes as you get older.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a video uploaded to his Instagram page, Doctor Amir Khan, who is best known for his appearances on ITV, shared some health concerns some of his patients have - and why they’re not typically anything to worry about.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking to his more than 900,000 followers, he said: “You know, something that patients say to me all the time after they reach 40 or 50 is, ‘Dr Amir, I feel like my body has changed.’ And honestly, they're not imagining it.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDr Amir, who is 45 himself, continued: “There are some very real biological changes that start happening in our 40s that nobody really prepares us for.”\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nLoss of muscle\n\n“One of the biggest” changes your body might experience is a loss of muscle. Dr Amir said: “Now, one of the biggest is muscle. From around our 30s onwards we gradually lose muscle mass, a process called sarcopenia.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“And by our 40s, it becomes more noticeable. Muscle fibre shrinks, strength drops slightly, and joints can feel stiffer because muscle is what stabilises and protects them.\n\n“So if you feel weaker, less toned, or take longer to recover after activity, it's not laziness, it's just biology. It's age-related muscle change and it's why strength training becomes so important in midlife.”\n\nWeight\n\nOn top of this, you might notice where you hold weight on your body changes. Dr Amir said: “Now another change often people notice is weight shifting around the middle.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“Even if diet hasn't changed, fat distribution does change with age. Oestrogen and testosterone levels gradually decline, and that changes where the body stores fat, more around the abdomen, less around the hips and limbs.\n\n“At the same time lower muscle mass slightly reduces resting metabolic rate. So the scale may not change dramatically but body shape can. That's a hormonal and metabolic shift, not a personal failing.”\n\nView 2 Images Dr Amir said: “There are some very real biological changes that start happening in our 40s that nobody really prepares us for.” (Image: 2019 Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVision\n\nChanges to your eyesight is “super common”. “Now this one's super common - vision,” he said.\n\n“Around the 40s, the lenses inside the eye become less flexible. We call this presbyopia, it makes focusing on close objects harder.\n\n“So people start holding menus or phones further away or needing brighter lights. It's universal ageing of the eye, not eye disease, and almost everyone experiences it by their mid-50s.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHair\n\nYou might notice some unexpected hairs popping up. Dr Amir said: “Now, let's talk about the one that surprises people - random chin and facial hair.\n\n“Now as oestrogen levels slowly decline in mid-life, the balance between oestrogen and other hormones called androgens, like testosterone, shift. Androgens, which we all have, stimulate coarse hair growth on areas like the chin and upper lip.\n\n“So that's why sudden, darker, wiry hairs start appearing. They're very normal, it's all part of your hormones, even in people without the menopause yet .”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRecovery\n\nYou might find it harder to “bounce back” at this age. “Now another one I hear constantly is slower recovery after exercise, illness, or even a poor night's sleep,” the doctor said.\n\n“The bounce back just isn't as quick and that's because cellular repair processes, collagen turnover, and mitochondrial efficiency all gradually decline with age.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“There's also a tendency towards slightly higher baseline inflammation, sometimes called ‘inflam-ageing’, so your body can still recover just needs more time.”\n\nTolerance for late nights\n\nDr Amid said: “And finally, this is where I'm at, losing tolerance for late nights. Many people in their 40s notice they simply can't stay up or function the next day like they used to.\n\n“That's partly our circadian rhythm changing with age and partly, sleep architecture, becoming lighter and fragmented. Melatonin, timing shifts slightly earlier, and deep sleep proportion reduces, so late nights feel harder and sleep debt hits more.”\n\nArticle continues below\n\nHe added: “So, if you're in your 40s and noticing these changes, don't worry. It's not decline, it's just biology, we're all there.”"

Emma Herring was diagnosed with aggressive cancer after her symptoms were brushed off as a \"pulled muscle from having a panic attack\" and she was advised to take co-codamol.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEmma was also told she was \"too young for cancer\" and that her symptoms were most likely linked to anxiety, before eventually receiving a stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis — delivered over the phone while she was at work. Having suffered chest pains since April last year, Emma repeatedly sought medical help but claims she was misdiagnosed on numerous occasions. She also claimed that her age meant her symptoms were continually dismissed, with doctors attributing them to a possible pulled muscle, anxiety, pneumonia and even arthritis.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEmma, who works as an optical assistant at Specsavers, was eventually referred to the University Hospital of North Durham for further tests in early November. The very next day, she received the devastating news that she had a seven-centimetre tumour in her chest, a four-centimetre tumour in her neck, and that the blood cancer had spread to her lymph nodes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEmma is now calling on all young women to trust their instincts and seek a second opinion whenever something doesn't feel right.\n\nEmma, from Durham, said: \"I knew something wasn't right as I had been suffering these pains in my chest since April. I booked into my GP and saw a nurse practitioner who told me it was probably down to anxiety.\n\n\"Then around May time I had not improved, so I called 111, who advised I go to A&E for an ECG and I got an outpatient appointment with GP. No ECG was done and he told me it was likely I had pulled a muscle while having a panic attack.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Emma Herring before her diagnosis (Image: Emma Herring/SWNS)\n\n\"I have a history of anxiety, but I hadn't even mentioned having a panic attack, so I don't know where that came from. In August I had an X-ray and they could see a mass, - but (they) prescribed me antibiotics for suspected pneumonia as they discounted cancer due to my age.\n\n\"Around six weeks later there was improvement and my bloods were all over the place - but this time they mentioned arthritis. I was a bit confused why they were mentioning arthritis when I was having pains in my chest at the age of 22.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"After having another X-ray and CT scan in November, I went back to work the next day, as I'm not normally one to call in sick. But before I could start my shift at 8.30am they called me up over the phone and broke the news to me (that) it was cancer on the phone.\n\n\"It wasn't done in a consultation room with doctors, nurses or with any other support - just over the phone. We went to hospital and that is when we were told it was stage 4 cancer, the most advanced stage you can get, and I didn't believe it. It was and still is the scariest thing I have ever gone through in my life.\"\n\nEmma commenced intensive chemotherapy straight away at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle owing to the advanced and aggressive character of the cancer. What was originally planned as four cycles has since been prolonged to six and she is presently midway through cycle five.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWithin three weeks of beginning treatment, she lost her long flowing red hair - \"part of her identity\" - and something she said she was not prepared for.\n\nView 4 Images Emma Herring (Image: Emma Herring/SWNS)\n\nEmma added: \"My hair was my identity and I wasn't prepared for how quickly it happened. I also didn't have a chance to freeze my eggs and there's a chance I could end up infertile.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Because of the aggressiveness of my cancer, we just had to go straight into chemo, so they didn't have time to do that for me. It is upsetting thinking I may not be able to have children or may get an early menopause too.\n\n\"The whole experience has really affected me mentally, but also physically as well. I have to sometimes get my mum to help me out of the shower and I am 22.\n\n\"I just never ever expected to get cancer, especially not at this age. I was finally getting to a happy place in my life, got my own flat, and now it has all gone away from me.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I've moved back in with my parents, but I've only been out of hospital for around four or five days over the last few months. I used to enjoy going out with my friends, but now my life is on hold.\n\n\"It just feels like it is a waiting game as we don't fully know what is going to happen. I might need an operation as I had sepsis recently and they think the infection is quite deep-rooted.\n\n\"When I do go out of hospital, my bloods drop due to the treatment, so even when I go out shopping I have to be really careful about infections. I have always been relatively healthy, apart from the odd cold, I haven't been ill like this before - it is just absolutely crazy.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It is just frustrating because I knew something was up, all the signs were there. But because of my age, we just didn't think it would be as bad as it is and so progressive.\n\nView 4 Images Emma Herring during treatment (Image: Emma Herring/SWNS)\n\n\"I just take each day as it comes - you have good days and bad days and try to even approach the bad days with positivity. I have realised worrying or being scared or sad will not change anything and I'm just being positive.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I just want others to be aware of the symptoms, to seek a second opinion if things don't feel right, don't be afraid to bug them, like I did. People need to listen to their bodies. I have also had remarkable support from the Teenage Cancer Trust and I have to thank them immensely because I don't think I would have been able to do it without them.\"\n\nNow unable to work while undergoing treatment, Emma is facing mounting financial strain. She has launched a GoFundMe appeal to help meet essential costs, including travelling to and from hospital.\n\nGill Hunt, interim chief nurse for County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"We are very sorry to hear about Ms Herring's diagnosis and the distress this will have caused her and her family. We understand how frightening this experience must have been.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"While we are unable to comment on the specific details of an individual patient's care, we would welcome the opportunity to speak with Ms Herring directly, to listen to her experience and ensure appropriate support is in place. We encourage anyone who feels their symptoms are not improving, or who remains concerned about their health, to seek further medical advice. We are committed to learning from patient experiences and continually improving the care we provide.\"\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

            "content": "'Labour's devastating result in Gorton and Denton is a grim sign of trouble ahead'\n\nLabour MPs, jittery at the threat from Reform on the right, now have the Greens to fear on the left as Keir Starmer's claim that only his party could beat Farage was undermined\n\nView 2 Images The by-election result was a bitter blow to Keir Starmer's Labour party (Image: Getty Images)\n\nThere was a party who could keep Reform's toxic politics out of Greater Manchester.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut it wasn't Labour. Instead Hannah Spencer of the Greens pulled off a stunning upset, winning a comfortable majority in a seat Labour won with 13,413 votes just 18 months ago.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt is hard to overstate what a blow this is to an already demoralised party. For weeks, Labour MPs have been darkly muttering that a third place finish would be a disaster for Keir Starmer, who has only just survived a battle for his political life earlier this month.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLabour threw the kitchen sink at this by-election, deploying its well-oiled campaign machine that delivered a landslide general election victory in 2024.\n\nAlmost every Labour figure I've spoken to recently has been to Gorton and Denton, some several times. Popular politicians like Andy Burnham and Angela Rayner have been out knocking doors. Even Keir Starmer went on Monday, which is unusual for a Prime Minister.\n\nKeir Starmer suffers nightmare defeat in Gorton and Denton by-election READ MORE :\n\nGorton and Denton by-election: Live result as Greens SHOCK Labour and Reform with victory READ MORE :\n\nView 2 Images Green Party candidate and winner Hannah Spencer celebrates at an election rally with supporters (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe problem is that Mr Starmer has cast Labour as the anti-Reform party, but they weren't the ones who voters chose as alternative to Nigel Farage and his mob. A similar thing happened in a Senedd by-election in Caerphilly last year, where Plaid Cymru were the ones to beat Reform and push Labour into third place.\n\nA note of caution. It is unwise to extrapolate by-election results when thinking about a general election. A Labour source told me that the Greens may not be able to mobilise such support at a national level - which is probably true.\n\nGovernments of all stripes also tend struggle in by-elections as voters can give them a bloody nose in the safety of knowing it won't cause wider chaos.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut in politics, perception matters. The Greens have shown themselves as capable of defeating Reform and offering a left-wing alternative to Labour. It also shows Zack Polanski's party can win outside of the south - and strike a blow to Labour in its heartlands.\n\nLabour MPs, already jittery at the threat from Reform on the right, now have the Greens to fear on the left.\n\nUpcoming elections in Scotland, Wales and local councils in England have long been seen as a moment of danger for the PM. The stakes now could not be higher.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAnd then there's the Andy Burnham problem. Mr Starmer had a hand in blocking him from standing, and will now face recriminations over whether the Greater Manchester Mayor could have won it.\n\nThat decision was always lose-lose for the PM. If he allowed Burnham to stand, Labour risked losing the Greater Manchester mayoralty instead. And he would have invited someone with naked leadership ambitions into Westminster.\n\nBut as I wrote at the time, the blame for that decision now sits squarely on his shoulders."

The Soham killer was left in critical condition after reportedly having been beaten with a metal pole, and Durham Constabulary are now investigating.\n\nThe number one suspect in the attack is Anthony Russell, who is said to have claimed \"I've killed him\" as he was led away in handcuffs.\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

It was a very, very serious injury, having been struck on the skull like that.\" They claimed that Russell declared afterwards: \"I've done it, I've done it. I've killed him, I've killed him.\"\n\nIt has been claimed the attack took place after a fight broke out between the two prisoners, with one woman visiting an inmate housed alongside Huntley in the segregated wing telling the Mail he appeared to have been \"ripped apart like a rat\".\n\nView 5 Images Huntley was jailed for the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman in 2002 (Image: Shutterstock)\n\nShe said: \"He's in a bad, bad way.

Russell's attack on Huntley is just the latest carried out against Huntley since he was sent to jail in 2002.\n\nView 5 Images Huntley has been attacked multiple times while behind bars (Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nOne inmate threw boiling water over the killer in 2005, not long after he was sent behind bars, and he was slashed in the throat by another using a homemade implement five years later.

            "content": "Conor Benn to face former world champion on same card as Tyson Fury's return to boxing - as first bout since Eddie Hearn split is revealed\n\nConor Benn is set for a return to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium after agreeing to share top billing with Tyson Fury and Arslan Makhmudov and fight Regis Prograis in his first outing for new promotion Zuffa Boxing.\n\nThe British fighter announced his split with long-time promoter Eddie Hearn last week after 10 years of working together, with Benn instead joining Hearn's rival Dana White's fledgling company in an eight-figure deal.\n\nHearn revealed that he was 'devastated' by the defection, not least because he stood by the boxing dynasty scion throughout his ordeal over two failed drug tests in 2022.\n\nBenn previously fought in north London when he faced off with Chris Eubank Jr last year, with the fighter gaining his revenge after first being defeated by Eubank Jr in their initial meeting at the stadium.\n\nHis match-up with US light welterweight Prograis is set to take place on Saturday April 11, with their main event coming ahead of Fury's return to the ring after his retirement last year.\n\nThe evening is also set to be Netflix's first-ever live broadcast, following a number of events shown from the United States - including Anthony Joshua's meeting with Jake Paul last December - by the streaming giant.\n\nConor Benn will fight Regis Prograis on April 11 on the same card as the returning Tyson Fury\n\nFormer world champion Prograis last faced off with Jack Catterall on British soil at the Co-op Live in October 2024, with the Louisiana native losing to the Englishman by unanimous decision.\n\nBenn's decision to desert Hearn cast ripples through the boxing world, with Frank Warren sharing his comment in the form of a quote first made by former US President Harry S. Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

The teams are already going head-to-head for Premier League glory and will meet in next month's Carabao Cup final.\n\nCity could have a tough path getting to the quarter-finals, however. They are guaranteed to face a team they met in the group phase of the competition in the last-16.\n\nPep Guardiola's men may have to travel back to Norway to face this season's dark horses, Bodo/Glimt, after the Yellow Ones produced a historic two-legged victory to dump last season's finalists, Inter Milan, out of the competition.\n\nCity already know how difficult a prospect facing Bodo is, after being beaten 3-1 by them in the Arctic Circle in January.\n\nIf not Bodo, then City will face Real Madrid yet again. It would be the fifth straight campaign that the two giants have faced each other in a two-legged tie.\n\nIn their league phase fixture at the Bernabeu, City came from behind to beat Los Blancos 2-1, thanks to goals from Nico O'Reilly and Erling Haaland.\n\nLiverpool face two difficult ties against teams they faced in the league phase. Either Atletico Madrid or Galatasaray await for Arne Slot's Reds.\n\nManchester City beat Real Madrid in the league phase but could face them yet again\n\nThe six-time winners edged past Atletico in their opening fixture of this season's competition, with Virgil van Dijk scoring a stoppage-time header after Marcos Llorente's brace had clawed the Spanish side back level.\n\nHowever, they struggled against their other potential opponents Galatasaray, losing 1-0 in the intimidating RAMS Park.\n\nTottenham have the same two potential opponents as Liverpool, with Igor Tudor's team set to face either Atletico or Galatasaray in the round of 16.\n\nWin that tie, and Spurs could possibly face Chelsea or Newcastle in the quarter-finals."

My captain,' another said.\n\n'I would have had a week off work,' one quipped.\n\nIt wasn't even the worst viewing for Forest fans on the night.\n\nThe East Midlands club thrashed Fenerbahce 3-0 in the away leg last week in Vitor Pereira's first game in charge.\n\nBut the Turkish club came to England with a vengeance, taking a 1-0 lead after 22 minutes thanks to Kerem Akturkoglu.\n\nAnd Akturkoglu doubled Fenerbahce's lead from the penalty spot early in the second half after Jair Cunha's foul, which many felt had been cheaply given.\n\nBut Callum Hudson-Odoi halved the deficit and gave Forest breathing room in the tie after 68 minutes with a superb bottom-corner finish.\n\n\n\nFrom there, Pereira's side hung on to win the tie 4-2 on aggregate, despite being spooked and losing 2-1 on the night."

            "content": "How Erling Haaland's game has transformed in the absence of Man City wingers - and why Pep Guardiola is loving his new 'main character'\n\nUnlock more from Jack Gaughan inside the Manchester City camp with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight, analysis and more\n\nThe look was perfect. Emile Heskey wore it so well, that strange cocktail of exasperated indignation. You’re asking me about Erling Haaland? Ah, come on.\n\nHeskey, sat on upholstered leather to bring an air of authority to proceedings – those proceedings being to goad an ex-professional into saying something inflammatory on video for social media, all in the name of betting advertising – briefly weighed up the question of whether Haaland is 'world class'.\n\nHe answered 'no' and then the edited footage cuts to the former Liverpool striker explaining why, presumably to somebody who raised surprise in an action that now had him all of a fluster. ‘World class? Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals. Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals.’\n\nHeskey knows a thing or two about goals of course, having registered one in five games at club level and one in nine for England during a career that saw him clean up at Birmingham City’s Player of the Year Awards in 2005.\n\nThese days he spends a bit of his time flogging CBD online but here we are instead focusing on his suggestion that Haaland is selling snake oil to anybody who thinks he’s an elite striker.\n\nHeskey’s sons, Jaden and Reigan, are both products of Manchester City’s academy and have regularly trained alongside Haaland, so are perhaps in a better position to determine the 25-year-old record-breaker’s skillset from the perspective of somebody who has seen him close up.\n\nErling Haaland chases down the ball against Newcastle last Saturday during a dynamic display in which he had his most touches yet in a Premier League match, at 43\n\nHaaland set up Nico O'Reilly for City's second goal. The Norwegian has three assists since City's formation switch\n\nTheir old man’s game was predicated on doing the donkey work, allowing others to grab headlines. He did this expertly by bringing midfielders into play, occupying defenders, creating channels for others, generally enjoying the physicality of the Premier League.\n\nThat description does bring a man to mind, actually. Long hair, Scandinavian. Fastest ever to 100 Premier League goals. Second in this year’s assist charts with seven, behind only Bruno Fernandes. Part of a leadership team handpicked by the great Pep Guardiola. Seems like a full package. World class, you might say.\n\nDiscussion around what Haaland does or does not do came back round last weekend, when City squeezed past Newcastle United. The best all-round performance of his career has been the shout from a section of observers and Wayne Rooney gushed over the nature of it. ‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ Guardiola said, having already held Haaland up as an example to his team-mates in the dressing room after the 2-1 victory.\n\nBasically the message was to remember what he put in for the cause, the commitment and desire, the sort of which is non-negotiable if City are to beat Arsenal to this title.\n\nHaaland ran, defended, hustled like a man possessed. He bundled Dan Burn about as if the giant defender was a rookie on the slight side. There he was, heading away a dangerous corner in the dying seconds. He didn’t score but assisted beautifully for Nico O’Reilly’s second, standing up a right-foot cross to the back post. Haaland admired it as O’Reilly headed in before darting off to celebrate with the scorer.\n\n‘You can see his joy when other people succeed,’ Norway head coach Stale Solbakken has told Daily Mail Sport. ‘That is big proof of what a team player he is.’ Some City players have been somewhat surprised by his collegiate attitude over the years; that attribute is partly why Guardiola handed him more responsibility last summer.\n\nHis numbers against Newcastle paint a picture. A career-high 12 duels. His most touches in a Premier League match, at 43. No City player completed more clearances, albeit that is dependent on which source and what they determine a clearance to be.\n\nHis average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush, which is a product of Guardiola going with two up front and a box midfield in recent weeks. ‘We’ll see what we do when the wingers (Jeremy Doku and Savinho) are back,’ the City manager said. ‘I think he adapted perfectly. I’m not telling Erling to play left back.’\n\nIt’s no coincidence that Haaland has three assists since the formation switch and is now only one from his league-best tally.\n\n‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ City manager Pep Guardiola said of Haaland's efforts against Newcastle\n\nHaaland's average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush (Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki and Abdukodir Khusanov were all substitutes)\n\nThese bits are significant indicators of a complete centre forward, more Harry Kane than Cristiano Ronaldo. And it is a trend. The conversations around how Haaland’s game has been transformed, doing more for the team and not ‘just’ scoring an inordinate number of goals, have now surfaced at least four times this season.\n\nThe draw at Arsenal. Beating United in September’s derby – before which Haaland was a central figure in a team meeting about raising standards and when he completed more defensive actions than that Newcastle match. And after a home win against Bournemouth. Each display prompted discourse about his style, the sort of which that has that guy at the end of the bar earnestly offering that Haaland’s not just about goals anymore, you know.\n\nThat this talk about an improvement outside of his recognised zone, between the posts, happens periodically and presented as new begs the question: has he actually always been like this?\n\nThe answer is yes and no, although it certainly looks to the naked eye that he has grown into a main character of City’s build-up play. And often that is more instructive than the raw stats. Heading and City relying upon his size is the main upturn – and a drastic one. This has been an area that Haaland’s worked on for a long while, particularly with Marco Rose at Borussia Dortmund, and one he knew needed elevating.\n\nWhile the number of aerial duels he battles in is only up marginally per 90 minutes, 3.9 now compared to 3.55 last year and 3.2 during his first season, City are seeing far better results. Haaland now wins 64 per cent of those, up from an average of around 50.\n\nHis dribbling statistics are on an upward curve, one deft slalom against Newcastle given the slow-motion treatment by City’s video team this week. He takes on more of those per game and completes 40 per cent.\n\nBut then there are the others. Winning back possession in the final third is better than last year but not as prevalent as in 2023-24. Passes played into the box is half of the Treble year. Expected assists are broadly the same as his other three campaigns, chances created from open play are actually lower than ever - even if through-balls are now far higher than his normal average.\n\nAverage number of touches – the metric that detractors became obsessed by – are lower than his first two seasons, 24 now and 27 in that blistering first term when plenty mocked his lack of general involvement. But this takes into account the whole season, not just the period that City have been wingerless. Anyway, it's a funny old game. He’d not felt the ball once before a 15th-minute opener in Monaco and nobody mentioned it.\n\nHaaland is now winning far more of his aerial duels: 64 per cent up from an average of around 50\n\nHaaland's stats for winning back possession in the final third are better than last year\n\nOften the sheer weight of goals distract from everything else and perhaps the amazement of those feats wearing off has seen pundits look for other things in his game to highlight.\n\nCertainly working for the team is nothing new, Haaland particularly pleased with a decoy run to distract Juan Foyth, allowing Bernardo Silva to score, away at Villarreal in October as a recent example, even if dropping deep is.\n\nRoughing up William Saliba and Gabriel in the 2023 title showdown with Arsenal is a memorable display of force and doing the dirty stuff, while Norway marvelled at the way he pressed, ran channels and held up possession as they secured a vital World Cup qualification win over Italy in June.\n\nTactically, they are seeing him have a greater awareness of what is required, especially against supposedly superior opposition. And that is maybe where this year’s difference comes: the statistics are similar but it’s learning how best to utilise those opportunities to the betterment of players around him.\n\nEven as the league’s top scorer on 22, there have been struggles. A barren spell in front of goal either side of new year is being worked through and he is still not entirely out of that yet. Coming out of the dressing room at Anfield in his sliders, Haaland insisted there was ‘no excuse’ for his form and he has still only scored one from open play in his last 10 league games.\n\nHe has refused to put this down to fatigue, even if Guardiola has labelled him ‘exhausted’ and attempted to give rest where possible, Haaland benched for victory over Wolves last month. Haaland is between houses at the moment, the family temporarily moving down near Crewe, and spent some of his three days off after Newcastle in Paris.\n\nLeeds United next, the city of his birth, as the first half of the run-in starts motoring. City undoubtedly need him to start scoring regularly now and Guardiola has spoken candidly about the pressures the club’s No 9 places upon himself.\n\nHaaland celebrates scoring against Fulham with Phil Foden but he only has one goal from open play in his last 10 league games\n\n'The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola says. ‘We won the Treble because he scored I don’t know how many goals'\n\n‘The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola said. ‘That is the challenge for him. When your expectation is five goals a season, you can improve. We won the Treble because he arrived, he scored I don’t know how many goals (52), and the expectations are there.\n\n‘When you go four or five games without scoring, it is like “Oh what happened, what happened?” He puts a lot of responsibility on himself. He is a guy who desperately wants to help the team and the club. I always say to him not to put too much pressure (on himself).\n\n‘He knows how much we need him, he doesn’t want to leave the team disappointed. That is a big attribute. I would prefer that to somebody who doesn’t care. He’s completely the opposite, he suffers when he doesn’t score a goal. Don’t suffer, you do your best.’\n\n\n\nThe best will never be enough for some."

Countless had become armchair curling experts amid two beautiful weeks of Winter Olympics. The BBC broadcasts of the Games had 26.3million viewers in all.\n\nIt’s not the only time lately when that experience of tuning in to something transcending clicks and instant gratification was to be found on the BBC. Against a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January.\n\nThe ensuing digital clips were fine – bandaged captain Paul Dawson leaping to score and sending the roof off that modest stadium – but it was the unfolding match, the national suspense, the collective willing-on of the underdogs, the excellent Mark Chapman’s half-time talk with the Macclesfield manager’s brother, Wayne Rooney – which made it so fine and compelling.\n\nSport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities. Sport as we had once come to expect it from the broadcaster which takes our licence fee.\n\nThe BBC's Winter Olympics coverage showed sport as it actually unfolds. Sport with its myriad dramas and unpredictabilities... not merely social media clips\n\nAgainst a beautiful Peak District backdrop, Macclesfield’s defeat of Crystal Palace unfolded before our eyes on a sunny Saturday lunchtime in early January\n\nThe media landscape is changing at a mesmerising pace. The BBC, in the throes of existential crisis, are facing the financial challenge of streaming platforms which are making the commercial battle for live sport extremely competitive.\n\nBut it was not just those of us brought up on the live football commentary of John Motson, Barry Davies and the great Hugh Johns whose hearts were heavy when hearing the BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski tell the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant.\n\n‘We’re not competing against who we were competing with before,’ he said. ‘The BBC might have thought, traditionally, it was up against ITV, or Sky, or other broadcasters. Well, guess what? We’re not. We’re in a race to not be swiped. Up against people selling you holidays, or clothes companies, or two-for-one chicken breasts on sale from the supermarket, or football teams, or athletes.\n\n‘We still have reporting and live pages and digital video that draw in millions and millions and millions of people. You can still be relevant - you can still matter - if you don’t show the sport.’\n\nBBC Sport’s need for intellectual curiosity and imagination in a complicated media landscape extending far beyond outside broadcasts is undeniable. All in the industry are facing the same challenge. Clips are certainly working for them in terms of Premier League, Champions League and cricket coverage.\n\nBut it was what Kay-Jelski didn’t say, as well as his bleak and provocative suggestion that the BBC’s sports output is competing with poultry purveyors, which reinforced the sense that the national broadcaster have given up on live sport, in their pursuit of digital clicks.\n\nWhat you really wanted to hear was that BBC Sport are fighting for their lives to hold on to the rights of sports held dearest by the British public, in the face of aggressive streamers who want to monetise them. That the list of televised sport's free-to-air ‘crown jewels’ must, as a matter of national significance, be extended to preserve them for those who cannot or will not pay for an ever-growing number of commercial bolt-ons.\n\nA group of MPs have let it be known that they are supportive of such an extension. Here was some momentum to seize on. On all of the above, we heard nothing.\n\nThe BBC’s director of sport Alex Kay-Jelski told the Financial Times Business of Football summit that you don’t need to show live sport to stay relevant\n\nSome broadcast staff in the BBC’s Six Nations coverage, already split with ITV, are thought to be wondering how secure the future looks. Wimbledon five years from now? Who knows?\n\nThe Boat Race is the most recent live sport event lost from the BBC, with word coming down last autumn that the corporation had ‘fallen out of love’ with it. Granted, not an event guaranteed to feed the clips or ‘second screen’ culture. But one which is still held in huge national affection, with a 2.6million viewership.\n\nThe event, enthusiastically picked up by Channel 4, has now gone the same way as the Grand National, The Open, Test cricket, the Paralympics and Royal Ascot. Each of those pillars of British sport came with the licence fee in the early 1990s. No more.\n\nThis summer will see the Commonwealth Games not staged on the BBC for the first time – a disaster for organisers involved in their own fight for relevance. The Games have been picked up by TNT Sports.\n\nThat’s the same broadcaster whose low-rent coverage of the Ashes this winter was encapsulated by commentator Rob Hatch mistaking a replay of Jamie Smith's run-out as a live wicket and excitedly announcing that Ben Stokes had been dismissed.\n\nIn December, my colleague Mike Keegan’s reporting provided a graphic sense of how the BBC’s pivot to digital content, and the 16-24-year-old demographic it craves, is being viewed by staffers who believe in the concept of covering sports news on TV. His report related how a Q&A session with senior management, called a ‘culture cafe’ became a ‘slanging match’ at times.\n\nIt also highlighted how, in the same pursuit of the digital traffic, BBC Sport have recruited dedicated correspondents for Liverpool, Newcastle United, Chelsea and the Manchester clubs, as well as a ‘football tactics correspondent’ and a ‘football issues correspondent'. Chasing online audiences which the nation’s big clubs bring does not cohere with a Royal Charter which that states the BBC should be for everyone.\n\nKay-Jelski’s words this week suggested that he is fine with facing down the criticism. ‘It’s OK if a lot of these innovations don’t make everybody happy,’ he said. ‘It’s also OK if some of the traditional forms of its media content or sporting content don’t make people happy.’\n\nHow long before Wimbledon joins Sue Barker in departing our free-to-air screens?\n\nBut for two weeks this month, we were reminded that linear TV is not dead, as we sat together in front of the box in the corner of the room and watched skiers and snowboarders and skaters fly in northern Italy.\n\nWe witnessed the extraordinary outcome when BBC Sport commentators, editors, engineers and studio staff cohere. We were reminded of the understated brilliance of Hazel Irvine, one of the nation’s very best sports presenters.\n\nAnd it was all ours to view, for free. The very best of our licence fee.\n\nMy friend bought his young kids a carpet curling kit and says they were so besotted that they practised every day of the Games. Such is the wonder and absorption that live sport brings. You don’t fall in love with clips."

            "content": "Earlier this week, before his devastating hundred hurtled England into the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup, Harry Brook sauntered into a press conference, clocked the facial expressions of those present and suggested a smile or two wouldn’t go amiss.\n\nNaturally, there have been times during what has been the most harrowing of winters for Brook that facing questions from the media was the last thing he wanted to do. But the jovial nature of that entrance in Pallekele here in Sri Lanka told of his desire to move on and embrace the next chapter of his England captaincy.\n\nThere is no doubt that he is in a much happier place since this World Cup began, despite the revelations on its eve that he lied about being alone on the Halloween night out that ended with him being struck by a Wellington bouncer.\n\nThere is an irony here, because without the Yorkshireman’s honest testimony - coming clean to England coach Brendon McCullum during the final one-day international at Wellington's Sky Stadium on November 1 - there is a chance the episode might never have come out.\n\nFor the original story entered the public domain during England’s Ashes tour not because of the incident itself, but the fact he’d been reprimanded and fined £30,000 by his ECB bosses as a result. Equally, it was loyalty to team-mates Jacob Bethell and Josh Tongue that led Brook, in taking responsibility and apologising for his own actions, to say that he had been on his own.\n\nNot great optics, some will argue, and it led to further scrutiny from the outside world in the form of an ongoing investigation by the Cricket Regulator. But it has arguably strengthened Brook’s standing within the England dressing room - other players respect him. And they are increasingly his players.\n\nHarry Brook's attempts to protect his team-mates have strengthened his standing within the England dressing room\n\nBrook points to the heavens in memory of his grandmother Pauline after reaching his 50-ball hundred in Pallekele on Tuesday\n\nOver the course of his 10-month tenure, Brook’s influence on selection has shown itself with the recalls of Will Jacks and Tom Banton, two of his former England Under 19s team-mates, even if another close friend in Brydon Carse has fallen by the wayside.\n\nJacks has found himself in a new role at No 7, while Brook confessed at the start of this tournament that he did not necessarily have a specific position for Banton, just that he knew he wanted him in his first-choice XI. Liam Dawson was recalled from the international wilderness at the start of last summer. Surrounding himself with old friends, people with whom he shares mutual trust, has had the desired effect on and off the field.\n\nA strong bond has developed with Bethell, the team’s unofficial vice-captain and whose adventurous nature led to walks together through leafy Kandy, seeking out the best coffee shops.\n\nAway from the game, Brook lost his grandmother Pauline - whom he called his ‘rock’ - two years ago this month. She was someone who in typical Yorkshire style told him how things were. Berated him for bad shots. Or poor choices. Loved him unconditionally. Poignantly, he looked to the heavens in her memory when he reached three figures in Pallekele.\n\nGuidance more recently has come from his manager Phil Weston, the former Worcestershire and Gloucestershire player, whom he acknowledged has been an ‘amazing’ support as trouble shadowed him these past few months.\n\nBrook’s mum, Lucy, has been around too and was present for his 27th birthday last Sunday, including a 'cake smash' after victory over the tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, in which Bethell appeared to take great delight in the smearing of sponge and cream into the England captain’s face.\n\nThat took place at the team hotel in Kandy where two nights later in the bar, a posse of England players, mingling happily with fans, raised glasses to the 100 that had downed Pakistan by two wickets - booking the first ticket to the final four in the process.\n\nThere is a time and a place for such things, of course, and no one would be so prudish as to deny them a chance to celebrate success three nights before what is for England a dead-rubber against New Zealand on Friday.\n\nEngland are operating to a self-imposed curfew of midnight on non-matchdays during this tournament, but there has been no need for an alcohol ban, just a much more mature approach to its consumption in the light of an Ashes dogged by forensic examination of boozy incidents.\n\nBrook smashes a straight six on the way to his 50-ball century against Pakistan\n\nWill Jacks congratulates Brook on his ton. Brook wanted Jacks in the team and the all-rounder's presence is a sign of the captain's growing influence on selection\n\nFor one, there is not much opportunity for nights out in a World Cup schedule that has generally been travel, practice, play, repeat. Although they did stop off in Colombo in transit from Kolkata to Kandy last week, allowing a group of 20 and 30-somethings to act like 20s and 30-something men and enjoy some downtime.\n\nGolf and padel have been on the agenda, but watching Brook’s mastery of the Pakistan bowling attack on Tuesday was a reminder that to him cricket always comes first.\n\nMultiple publishers were interested in Brook writing a book this winter, charting a rise from West Yorkshire village club Burley-in-Wharfedale to a Test batsman averaging mid-50s, but he postponed it, citing a desire to retain full focus on England’s tour Down Under.\n\nSince resuming his limited-overs captaincy, he has orchestrated five wins out of six in bilateral matches here in Sri Lanka - using the defence of just 128 in the final T20 as a reference point during team meetings for maintaining a never-say-die-attitude at this tournament.\n\nImprovements have been noticeable both in terms of tactics and temperament: an instinct call to open the bowling with Jacks despite a competition economy rate touching 14 rushed the Sri Lankans to Super Eight defeat last weekend, while slowing his bowlers down between deliveries to regain composure proved a crucial factor in the last-ball thriller versus Nepal. Pre-match chats have not altered, with input from Brook and Brendon McCullum bookending thoughts from the floor.\n\nBut several members of the squad have reflected on the increasingly symbiotic relationship of Brook and McCullum, which would bode well for the future if the New Zealander were secure in his position.\n\nHowever, the threat of post-Ashes change coincides with Ben Stokes being assigned a ‘coaching’ role with England Lions in the UAE, effectively increasing contact time with Andrew Flintoff following their partnership at Northern Superchargers last August. Such arrangements might just be coincidence, of course.\n\nBrook calls McCullum the best coach he’s known, and immediately credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy the Pakistan attack.\n\nBrook calls England coach Brendon McCullum the best he’s known and credited him as the mastermind behind the move to No 3 that saw him destroy Pakistan\n\nLike Ben Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect on Brook\n\nThose close to him joke that Brook wears his intelligence lightly - Joe Root playfully dubbed him an 'idiot' last year. Yet his cricketing smarts are there for all to see.\n\nTake that 50-ball hundred when in conjunction with Sam Curran and Jacks - fellow gym bunnies - the Pakistanis were run ragged on Pallekele’s huge expanses, conceding nine twos in addition to Brook’s 14 boundaries. He later joked that his 2023 self would have carried too much timber to have seen through the plan.\n\nLike Stokes before him, the responsibility of captaincy appears to be having a maturing effect, even if there are blips - like the too-close-to-the-bone Stone Cold Steve Austin beer slam celebration marking his one-day hundred here in Colombo last month.\n\nThe thousands of supporters that flocked to Australia did so in the hope of witnessing such hundreds there, not brain fades that gifted his wicket away.\n\nBut hope remains that his first truly match-defining international innings can raise smiles until what is the very latest point on England’s winter schedule - the final in Ahmedabad a week on Saturday - seeing him emulate Paul Collingwood, Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler as World Cup-winning captains."

Self-destruction.\n\nIf that seems a little harsh on a team currently five points clear at the top of the Premier League, consider that they are second in another table.\n\nOnly rivals Tottenham have conceded more goals from errors this calendar year (five to Arsenal's four), with a streak of costly lapses threatening to undermine the Gunners' momentum.\n\nHad it not been for the emphatic 4–1 scoreline against Spurs last weekend, this dangerous pattern might already have been laid bare. Instead, the winning margin that day masked an issue which has been lingering in the background.\n\nOn Sunday, Declan Rice was the culprit, uncharacteristically giving the ball away to Randal Kolo Muani outside of the area, ahead of the Frenchman's equaliser.\n\nComing from a man who has been so dependable for Arsenal all season long, the error felt significant.\n\nArsenal players have made four errors leading to goals in 2026, with Declan Rice (left) at fault for Tottenham's equaliser on Sunday\n\nIt's a problem Mikel Arteta needs to solve soon, with the title race decided by such fine margins\n\nPlayers are human, of course. Mistakes can happen. But when it becomes concerning is when a trend emerges.\n\nBetween their opening match of the season against Manchester United on August 17 and December 31, the Gunners made just one mistake that directly led to a goal — the fewest across the league, and a testament to their brilliant defensive record.\n\nThat error came when Martin Zubimendi was tackled in the build-up to Richarlison’s consolation goal against Spurs in November.\n\nIt was an isolated lapse, and the big question at the time was whether Arsenal could break Chelsea’s 2004-05 record of conceding just 15 goals in a single campaign. But since the turn of the year, cracks have begun to show.\n\nRice’s misstep was merely the latest in a sequence of self-inflicted wounds: against Bournemouth, Gabriel’s defensive lapse was ruthlessly punished by Evanilson; versus Manchester United, Zubimendi was caught out and Bryan Mbeumo capitalised.\n\nAnd in the meeting with Wolves, confusion between Gabriel and David Raya in the area allowed Tom Edozie to convert a stoppage-time equaliser, with his strike rebounding off Riccardo Calafiori and into the net.\n\nTo make matters worse, title rivals Manchester City are yet to concede a single goal due to an individual error in 2026. The contrast couldn't be starker.\n\nThe margins are razor-thin at the top, yet the Gunners are being hurt by their own avoidable mistakes.\n\nThese are not systemic defensive collapses, nor tactical breakdowns. They are concentration lapses, moments that elite sides simply cannot afford, and point towards a psychological battle amid the rising pressure of trying to win the club's first Premier League title in over 20 years.\n\nMartin Zubimendi feels the heat after gifting Manchester United a goal at the Emirates last month. Arsenal went on to lose the game 3-2\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh earned 20 caps for Northern Ireland and played for Tottenham and Norwich.\n\nHaving seen both sides of the equation, he is clear on how pressure will be affecting the Arsenal players’ mental psyche.\n\nMcVeigh told Daily Mail Sport: ‘When players are in the zone, they call it being in a flow state. This is when players perform at their best because they're not thinking about it. It allows the muscles in their frame for years and years to be able to perform and not even think about it.\n\n‘But once players are aware (of the pressure), it becomes more and more important. And of course, it's very difficult to stop thinking about it now that you're in the zone.\n\n‘This group of players (at Arsenal) have come close and fallen away quite a lot of times over the last few years, so it is very difficult to stay in the subconscious.\n\n‘The players who have won league titles, like the Manchester City players, who have done it a number of times over the last five years, they have the experience of getting over the line.\n\n‘So they might have different strategies they can use. The majority of the Arsenal team, however, don’t know how to navigate the situation of being in a title race, and the Arsenal fans are expecting them to throw it away.’\n\nThe culprits of these errors are seasoned players at the top of their games, the mistakes coinciding with a tide of expectation which has continued to build from the outside.\n\nThat his given opposition teams, even as lowly as Wolves, a glimmer of hope in matches which Arsenal fail to kill off.\n\nMikel Arteta’s men are no longer suffocating games once they gain control. Instead, they are offering opponents moments, small windows that top-flight forwards can exploit.\n\nSports psychologist Paul McVeigh played over 200 games for Norwich. He insists Arsenal's near-misses in previous Premier League seasons will have taken a toll\n\nA loose pass in midfield or a split-second of indecision at the back each carries amplified consequence in a title race defined by the smallest of details.\n\nIt is this slight vulnerability which has prevented the north London club being at least eight points clear at the top — had they beaten Wolves and drawn with Manchester United — instead of just five. In that scenario, the title race would have felt an awful lot more settled than it does now.\n\nMcVeigh, who wrote a book titled It’s Not About You: The Psychology of Leadership featuring an interview with Robert Pires, played against the 2004 Invincibles side when he was at Norwich. That team is incomparable to the current Arsenal side in his eyes.\n\n‘I don't think there's any comparison at all,’ he explained. ‘The team I played against were almost superhuman.\n\n‘When I was playing (against them), not only did Thierry Henry not have to run with the ball at his feet, he was walking with it, as if to say, “Don't come near me because if you do, I'm going to embarrass you”.\n\n‘And so I took him at his word and I didn't go near him, I kept backing off. The difference is, there was a supreme confidence and inner belief that team, especially personified by Thierry Henry, were going to win.\n\n‘By that stage, Henry, Patrick Vieira, Pires, all these guys were World Cup winners, absolute serial winners, and they were all coming together with another group of players in that team who had all won significant prizes. That is the massive difference.’\n\nA stoppage-time mix-up between Gabriel and David Raya at Wolves last week saw the Gunners drop two points to the league's bottom side\n\nThe good news for Arteta is that the issue can be fixed. In terms of what Arsenal can do to cope with pressure and iron out mistakes, McVeigh added: ‘They could be doing things like visualisation, affirmations, setting goals, psycholinguistics, working as a group and having discussions on all of this. There's so many different things.\n\n‘Whether players are actually good at this, working on their psychology, I would highly doubt. In my 30 years in professional football, I would say less than one per cent of people in professional football utilised sports psychology, which for me is just an absolute crutch.\n\n‘They (Arsenal) have sports psychologists. The difference is, does anyone actually use them? That's always the question: how much trust does a player have in a psychologist that the club provides? Potentially, the player might doubt that there's going to be complete trust between them and the psychologist.\n\n‘The psychologist could be having conversations with the manager, which is always the difference. It is why, even as a player, you might struggle a little bit (to trust them).’\n\nDespite some of the recent errors, it is not as though Arsenal’s defence is meek or weak. From August through December, their remarkable solidity was the backbone of their good form, with their backline the envy of Europe.\n\nA fearsome centre-back partnership of Gabriel and William Saliba, aided by defensively sound full backs in the shape of Jurrien Timber and either Calafiori or Piero Hincapie, is a mean defence on paper.\n\nWhen asked about why his team were conceding such few goals earlier in the season, Arteta replied: ‘The right level of organisation, but especially with the desire to play, shown every day, and the commitment that they show to do all the duties necessary for us to be a team that is very difficult to play against and to score against.’\n\nHe views defending as an element the whole team has to buy into, a non-negotiable even.\n\nDefending is something Arteta wants his whole team to buy into. Will his side be able to restore their superb record before the season is out?\n\nSince January, that sharpness has dulled just enough to tilt tight contests in the wrong direction. Arsenal have conceded eight goals across nine league games in 2026. Before the turn of the year, it was 13 conceded across 19 games.\n\nThe nine-match sample so far this year includes conceding two goals each against bottom-placed Wolves and mid-table Bournemouth, as well as shipping three at home to United. Clean sheets have given way to recovery jobs, and authority has been replaced by anxiety.\n\nThe data shows a rise in goals conceded, but the eye test reveals hesitation where there was once conviction. And at this level, hesitation is costly.\n\n\n\nIf Arsenal are to go the distance, the mistakes must stop — and immediately."

            "content": "Mike Ashley is not the worst owner. Now there is a statement that would have once raised eyebrows, if not fists, on Tyneside.\n\nA black and white might have left you black and blue for daring to be so antagonistic. Yet, for Sheffield Wednesday, there is a grain of hope in that thought.\n\nFor Ashley to make a success of any investment — you can measure that in pounds and pence — his football club needs to function, albeit dysfunctionally. It is not in the interest of him nor the brands whose colours will soil the club for it to drop down the pyramid and be run into the ground.\n\nThink of the two seasons when he showed most interest and ambition at Newcastle — they were both in the Championship. The first time, in 2009/10, he funded the pay packets of Nicky Butt, Alan Smith, Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and Andy Carroll and his team amassed 102 points as champions. Seven years later and the stardust was in the dugout in the form of Rafa Benitez. Again, they won the league. Not every club relegated from the Premier League has an owner so desperate to take them back to the top flight, even if the motivation was self-interest. Once back in the top flight, however, the aspiration did not extend far beyond keeping the billboard prominent.\n\nIf Ashley is to get involved with Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure. That, for them, is no bad thing given their current plight. Supporters might have to hold their nose — and close their eyes to avoid the red and blue — but Ashley’s scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his primary goal.\n\nHis attitude to football changed the day his family were verbally abused when Newcastle were relegated at Villa Park in 2009, two years after he had bought the club. As one source told us when Ashley finally sold Newcastle to a Saudi-backed consortium in 2021: ‘The club became about maximising brand exposure for Sports Direct at the expense of on-field ambition. He had an attitude of, “All noise is good noise”.\n\nIf Mike Ashley (left) is to get involved with Sheffield Wednesday, it will be business, not pleasure\n\nAshley scent for a quick profit would make a speedy return to the Championship his main goal\n\n‘A lot of the stunts he pulled were exactly that — renaming the stadium, branding all over the ground, he knew the publicity it would generate.\n\n‘If the team did well at the same time then great, but he wasn’t going to invest his own money chasing the top four, the margins didn’t add up. Instead, it was about making the club self-sufficient, making a profit on player sales and staying in the Premier League to keep Sports Direct prominent.’\n\nAshley likes distressed assets and will sense an opportunity at Hillsborough. Not to be the altruistic white knight, more so the dark horse with cold-eyed intent. But when the starting line is League One and the threat of extinction, the 61-year-old is not necessarily a bad bet. He has ridden a similar track before, given the big-club heritage of Newcastle, iconic home and invested fanbase. He will know some of the shortcuts to accelerate the journey.\n\nAs for the destination, the comfort for supporters is that it should be a better place than where they find themselves.\n\nAshley does not want to see a team bounce around League One. The detail might well be in the retail, but that is the price on the ticket if he is to swoop in and rescue the club. He would certainly generate interest.\n\nHere is one story that captures the maverick of the man. During a meeting with Sports Direct senior managers, he gave them all a playing card. Ashley had a deck and started turning over cards from the top. The first to match was a store boss from Teesside, and Ashley gave him the keys to a new Ferrari Spider. It is rarely dull around Ashley. Buckle up, Sheffield Wednesday."

He clashed with Wilcox in a meeting three days before the trip to Elland Road.\n\nUnited took the decision amid concerns the team could fail to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nAmorim was replaced on an interim basis by Darren Fletcher before the club appointed Michael Carrick, who has won five and drawn one of his six games in charge to boost United's chances of returning to European football's top table.\n\nThe Red Devils are fourth having won the most points - 18 - of any Premier League team this calendar year.\n\nThe top five in the Premier League will secure a Champions League place next season and United are three points clear of Liverpool in sixth.\n\n\n\nAmorim won only 25 of his 63 games in charge and finished 15th in the Premier League before losing the Europa League final to Tottenham in May."

After mild heckling from the audience, he added the rider: “Should have been eight.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd, of course, Norris is spot-on. Being pipped to the 2021 title by Max Verstappen was one of the great sporting injustices of all time, the Dutch driver gifted the opportunity by a patently erroneous decision from race director Michael Masi towards the end of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn fact, it was not just erroneous, it was scandalous. Rather than being level with Michael Schumacher at the top of the all-time world championship-winners list, Hamilton should be one ahead.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLando Norris and Max Verstappen ‘respect’ verdict given after controversial world title dig READ MORE :\n\nF1 driver update after losing control in terrifying crash as marshals rush to help READ MORE :\n\nHe could still go out on his own and there have been pre-season signs that his Ferrari will be more competitive than it was last season. But an eighth crown remains an unlikely prospect. In his last season with Mercedes and in his first season with Ferrari, Hamilton, who turned 41 last month, was consistently outperformed by his team-mate. George Russell and Charles Leclerc are 28 years of age.\n\nThe 2026 season gets underway in Melbourne next week, with the Shanghai race taking place the following week. For Hamilton, they will be two of the most significant races of his stellar career. There are no excuses.\n\nHe has had a year to settle into Ferrari, to become accustomed to a new team. That always takes time. And there is absolutely no suggestion Leclerc will get any preferential treatment.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton both failed to win a race for Ferrari in the 2025 Formula One season (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nFor Hamilton, the races in Australia and China will be as much against his fellow Ferrari driver as they are against the field. He needs to prove he still has the sharpest of competitive edges, he needs to show age has not dulled his racing instincts, has not diluted his bravura.\n\nThe main players in Formula One driving are in an age range that goes from mid to late twenties. Max Verstappen, whose run of four world titles was ended by 26-year-old Lando Norris, is 28 years of age.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nNone of the elite pack - Norris, Verstappen, Oscar Piastri (24), George Russell, Leclerc - are turning 30 any time soon.\n\nView 4 Images Max Verstappen has hinted that he will retire from Formula One sooner rather than later (Image: NurPhoto, NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nBut Verstappen is already talking about retirement. “I definitely see myself nearing the end,” the Red Bull driver said recently.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n“I don’t want to spend 25 years driving a car. I want to appreciate what’s out there.”\n\nHamilton has always seemed to be the sort that could spend 25 years driving a car - this will be his 20th year in Formula One - but still ‘appreciate what’s out there’. His interests beyond the car are clearly considerable.\n\nView 4 Images Lando Norris won his first drivers' world championship last season (Image: FIA/DPPI via Getty Images)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nBut he will not want to be seen as a ceremonial driver, as a driver who has been hired by Ferrari as much for his commercial pull as for his brilliance behind the wheel. Don’t forget, he is arguably the Greatest Of All Time.\n\nBut Hamilton’s last victory was in July, 2024. His last podium finish was in the same year, at the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Hamilton has earned the right to stay in a Formula One car for as long as he wants. And if he is still enjoying it - as he insists he is - why not carry on?\n\nBut Melbourne and Shanghai will tell us all we need to know about whether the GOAT has still got it. For the sport’s sake, let’s hope he has."

            "content": "Kon Knueppel drops in a 3-pointer in the third quarter, setting the record for most 3-pointers made in a season for an NBA rookie. (0:18)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Charlotte's Kon Knueppel reached yet another milestone in a remarkable rookie season for the No. 4 pick out of Duke.\n\nThe Hornets swingman broke Keegan Murray's NBA rookie record for 3-pointers, making his 207th on Thursday night against the Indiana Pacers. Knueppel connected on five 3s in the first half and then broke the record in the third quarter off an assist from Sion James, his former college teammate with the Blue Devils.\n\nHe finished with 28 points in the 133-109 win, with his 8 3s (on 12 attempts) tying his career high and landing just one shy of tying the NBA rookie record. He leads the NBA with 209 3s.\n\n\"It's really just about making the right basketball play,\" Knueppel said after the win. \"My teammates are setting good screens and setting me up in good spots. The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes.

The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough.

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

You can't even dream about something like that. I have no words to describe the emotions right now.\"\n\nDaniel Lukacs had given the hosts a third-minute lead at the Puskas Arena and after Parrott's coolly-taken penalty had dragged the visitors back into it, Barnabas Varga blasted Hungary in front once again before the break.\n\nHowever, Heimir Hallgrimsson's men simply refused to be beaten on a night when only victory would be enough and after making the most of Finn Azaz's astute pass to level the scoreline again, Parrott ran on to Liam Scales' knockdown to snatch victory at the death.\n\nThe play-offs will be held in March next year, with 12 group runners-up participating, along with the four best-ranked group winners of the 2024/25 UEFA Nations League that did not finish their European Qualifiers group stage in first or second place."

One year on, with a significant GH¢42.1 billion allocation to education in the 2025 budget, Eduwatch says Ghanaians deserve clarity on how these funds were used to pursue that vision.\n\nEduwatch says it is critical for the President to outline “key accomplishments and outcomes that have emerged in the past year”, explain challenges encountered and present mitigation strategies to strengthen policy and budgetary efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nA top priority for the organisation in the 2026 SONA is an update on the government’s strategy for targeted recruitment and equitable deployment of teachers to underserved basic schools. Eduwatch underscored that the failure to recruit teachers in 2025 deepened staffing deficits, particularly in rural and deprived districts where shortages were already severe — a gap that has strained learning conditions and worsened the crisis of out-of-school children.\n\nAccording to the statement, the lack of adequate teacher deployment “has not only strained learning conditions, but has also aggravated the out-of-school children crisis in communities where access to qualified teachers remains a decisive barrier to participation and retention.”\n\nEduwatch’s calls for accountability come as the SONA is expected to cover a range of sectors, including the economy, health, education, agriculture and infrastructure, while also outlining policy priorities for the year ahead in line with constitutional requirements.\n\nThe President’s annual address serves as a platform to assess government performance and set the tone for legislative and policy actions in the coming year.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

This includes a FIFA-approved training camp and four international friendly matches.\n\n“The FIFA camp, you would be engaged in some activities, including friendly matches that you organise. And so, the pre-tournament, per the estimates, we are utilising $1,230,465 converted to cedis, is GH¢13,063,723.90. This will finance the friendly matches”; he said.\n\nThe largest portion of the budget is $6,284,000 (GH¢66,716,599) which is earmarked for the group stage. This covers appearance fees, match bonuses, per diems for players and technical staff, as well as allowances for additional officials.\n\nHe explained that the costs reduce in certain areas once the team advances beyond the group stage, particularly as appearance fees are no longer paid.\n\n“When we get to the round of 32, our expenditure drops because at that stage, you are not paying any appearance fee anymore. It drops to $690,000 or in cedis, GH¢7,325,661”; he outlined.\n\nThe projected spending for the round of 32 stands at $690,000 (GH¢7,325,661).\n\nIf Ghana progress further, the budget rises in line with performance bonuses. The round of 16 is estimated at $920,000, the quarter-finals at $1,137,500, the semi-finals at $1,365,000, and the final at $1,840,000.\n\nAn additional $310,000 has been allocated for honorariums for management, officials and support staff during the tournament.\n\n“The total budget requested from the Ghana Football Association for the Black Stars’ participation in the 2026 World Cup came to $310,000 or in cedi terms, GH¢146,268,659.80\".\n\nGhana will face Panama in their opening group match before taking on England and Croatia.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

He thanked Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, Andrii Sybiha, for approving what he described as an unusual request — reportedly the first of its kind by an African foreign minister.\n\n“I can confirm that our citizens are alive and well. Their rights under international law have been commendably respected by Ukrainian authorities,” Mr Ablakwa stated.\n\nHe noted that the rare access granted by Ukrainian authorities reflects the cordial bilateral relations between Ghana and Ukraine and strengthens confidence in ongoing negotiations aimed at securing the men’s freedom.\n\n“This significant gesture gives me more confidence that our negotiations for their release will be successful,” he said.\n\nThe identities of the two prisoners have been withheld for security reasons. However, the minister revealed that both men expressed a firm resolve to turn their ordeal into advocacy.\n\n“It is refreshing to hear our two compatriots say that they are determined to become advocates against the modus operandi of trafficking networks and willing to devote the rest of their lives educating vulnerable Africans how to avoid such predicaments,” he added.\n\nMr Ablakwa’s visit to Kyiv forms part of high-level diplomatic engagements between Ghana and Ukraine, during which he also held talks with President Zelenskyy. The discussions are understood to have centred on bilateral cooperation and humanitarian considerations regarding the detained Ghanaians.\n\nThe development marks a significant step in Ghana’s diplomatic push to secure the safe return of its citizens while reinforcing its commitment to protecting nationals caught up in foreign conflicts.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The spotlight falls on the Arsenal and Chelsea rivalry once again on Sunday 1 March 2026, as the London heavyweights collide at the Emirates Stadium in a match that could have major implications at the upper end of the Premier League table.\n\nArsenal begin the weekend perched at the summit, but the mood around N5 is a little edgier than it was a fortnight ago. A frustrating 2-2 draw against bottom-of-the-log Wolves last week — in which they surrendered a two-goal lead — has invited renewed pressure from title rivals Manchester City. Having finished as runners-up in each of the past two seasons, the Gunners are desperate to avoid an unwanted hat-trick of near-misses.\n\nTheir home form remains a cornerstone of their challenge, and they will view this derby as an opportunity to reassert authority. Yet recent stumbles have highlighted vulnerabilities, particularly in defensive transitions, and Chelsea possess the pace and confidence to exploit any hesitation.\n\nThe visitors arrive with growing belief under new head coach Liam Rosenior. Appointed midway through the campaign, Rosenior is unbeaten in his first six Premier League matches in charge — a run that has reignited their push for a top-four, or potentially top-five, finish and a coveted Champions League berth.\n\nChelsea’s structure looks sharper, their pressing more coordinated, and there is renewed resilience in tight moments.\n\nThis will be the fourth meeting between the sides this season. Their league encounter at Stamford Bridge ended 1-1 in November, while Arsenal edged both legs of the League Cup semi-final — winning 3-2 away before sealing the tie with a 1-0 victory at home earlier this month. Familiarity breeds intensity, and there will be little margin for surprise.\n\nHistorically, Arsenal hold the edge in this fixture. Across 214 meetings in all competitions, they have 87 wins to Chelsea’s 66, with 61 draws. That statistical advantage, however, will count for little once the whistle blows.\n\nWith Arsenal fighting to protect top spot and Chelsea chasing Europe’s elite competition, the stakes are considerable. Expect a high-tempo, tactically charged derby — one that may significantly shape the trajectory of the title race and the battle for Champions League qualification alike.\n\nHead-to-Head\n\nPlayed: 214\n\nArsenal wins: 87\n\nChelsea wins: 66\n\nDraws: 61\n\nMeetings this season:\n\n\n\n- Premier League: Chelsea 1-1 Arsenal, 30 November 2025\n\n- League Cup, semifinal, first leg: Chelsea 2-3 Arsenal, 14 January 2026\n\n- League Cup, semifinal, second leg: Arsenal 1-0 Chelsea, 3 February 2026\n\nKey battle\n\nDeclan Rice v Cole Palmer\n\nRice Premier League season stats\n\nAppearances: 26\n\nGoals: 4\n\nAssists: 6\n\nYellow/red cards: 2/0\n\nPalmer Premier League season stats\n\nAppearances: 16\n\nGoals: 8\n\nAssists: 1\n\nYellow/red cards: 3/0\n\nThe midfield duel between Declan Rice and Cole Palmer could define the rhythm of the London clash between Arsenal and Chelsea. Rice will anchor Arsenal’s engine room, tasked with breaking up play, winning second balls and setting the tempo as the Gunners push to assert control.\n\nOpposite him, Palmer offers Chelsea their spark between the lines, drifting into pockets to create, carry and threaten with clever movement and sharp decision-making. If Rice can stifle Palmer’s influence, Arsenal gain control. If Palmer finds space, Chelsea gain belief. It’s a battle of authority versus invention at the heart of the contest.\n\nTactical outlook\n\nMikel Arteta v Liam Rosenior\n\nArteta Premier League stats\n\nMatches: 236\n\nWins: 140\n\nDraws: 48\n\nLosses: 48\n\nPoints: 468\n\nRosenior Premier League stats\n\nMatches: 6\n\nWins: 4\n\nDraws: 2\n\nLosses: 0\n\nPoints: 14\n\nThe tactical duel between Mikel Arteta and Liam Rosenior promises to be pivotal at the Emirates. Arteta’s Arsenal will look to dominate possession, control the midfield, and press high to force Chelsea into errors, relying on structured build-up and quick transitions.\n\nRosenior, meanwhile, will aim to disrupt Arsenal’s rhythm, exploiting space in transition and encouraging his players to attack in wide channels. Set-pieces, pressing triggers, and defensive compactness will be key.\n\nUltimately, it’s a clash of styles: Arteta’s structured, possession-based approach against Rosenior’s adaptive, counter-attacking strategy, with each coach seeking to outthink the other from the touchline.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Ghana loses more than GHS 6.2 billion each year to diseases linked to poor waste management and sanitation, a new study by the Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic Research (ISSER) at the University of Ghana has revealed.\n\nThe findings were presented at a high-level stakeholder engagement in Accra on Thursday, 26 February 2026. The forum brought together policymakers, Members of Parliament, local government officials, development partners, and private-sector actors to examine the economic case for increased investment in sanitation.\n\nThe research, led by Prof. Peter Quartey and Dr Kwame Adjei-Mantey, is titled An Economic Analysis of the Benefits of Adequate Investment in Waste Management and Sanitation in Ghana. It assessed both the economic and social consequences of current sanitation practices and modelled the potential gains from improved financing.\n\nAccording to the study, five diseases closely associated with poor sanitation — malaria, cholera, pneumonia, typhoid fever and diarrhoea — account for nearly 31.9 million lost workdays annually and an estimated 177,222 deaths.\n\nDirect medical costs were estimated at approximately GHS 5.8 billion annually, with an additional GHS 650 million in lost productivity. This brings the total annual economic burden to over GHS 6.2 billion.\n\nDespite these losses, Ghana currently spends an average of about GHS 38 per tonne of waste generated. The researchers described this as modest compared to the scale of the health and economic damage associated with poor sanitation systems.\n\nUsing cost–benefit modelling, the team found that under the current business-as-usual approach, every GHS 1 invested in waste management generates about GHS 180 in economic returns. Under a best-case scenario — where investment rises to approximately GHS 1,028 per tonne in line with lower-middle-income benchmarks — returns could increase to GHS 556 per GHS 1 invested.\n\nIn absolute terms, projected national benefits under the enhanced investment scenario could reach about GHS 58 billion in 2025 and rise to GHS 67.2 billion by 2032. These gains are largely driven by sharp reductions in disease incidence, mortality and productivity losses.\n\nPresenting the findings, Prof. Quartey urged the government to stop treating sanitation as a residual expenditure. He stressed that waste management must be viewed as a high-return development investment capable of protecting public health and strengthening economic growth.\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session, participants raised concerns about how much of the disease burden could be directly attributed to waste. The research team explained that their modelling relied on global health data and assumed that about 45 per cent of the selected disease cases were attributable to waste exposure. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to test different attribution levels.\n\nStakeholders also questioned whether the best-case scenario reflected realities in slum and rural communities, where waste collection remains inconsistent. Prof. Quartey acknowledged that waste management in such areas is more complex and costly due to access challenges, noting that flexible and smaller-scale collection systems may be required rather than a uniform national model.\n\nOther concerns centred on uncollected waste and dumping in drains and water bodies. The researchers said their modelling incorporated standardised ranges for lower-middle-income countries, taking into account infrastructure gaps and collection inefficiencies.\n\nMembers of Parliament at the forum emphasised the need for stronger inter-agency coordination. While some proposed the establishment of a National Sanitation Authority, others cautioned against expanding bureaucracy and instead suggested strengthening existing institutional structures.\n\nEducation and job creation also featured prominently in the discussions. Prof. Quartey referenced earlier regional research on green jobs and recycling, stressing that investment in skills development and public awareness could unlock employment opportunities in the waste sector.\n\nThe research team concluded that Ghana’s annual sanitation-related losses far exceed current spending levels. They called for increased and sustained investment, targeted interventions in high-risk communities, and stronger data and budgeting systems within Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies to ensure sanitation is prioritised as a central pillar of national development.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Business News of Friday, 27 February 2026\n\nSource: reuters.com\n\nThe producers of half the world’s cocoa – Ivory Coast and Ghana – have struggled to sell beans and pay farmers this year due to ample global harvests, lower cocoa prices and falling demand from chocolate makers for the ingredient.\n\n\n\nWhy did the two countries fare worse than rival producers and what are they doing to address the problem?\n\n\n\nCocoa is not freely traded in Ivory Coast and Ghana.\n\n\n\nRather, the two countries’ cocoa regulators – appointed by the government – sell some 80% of their beans to global traders a year in advance and, on the basis of those sales, set a fixed price for farmers at the season start in October.\n\n\n\nFarmers then sell their beans to local collectors at this price, and the collectors in turn sell them on to licensed buyers. After receiving the cocoa, licensed buyers either sell directly to global traders or to local traders who sell on to global traders.\n\n\n\nThe fixed farmer price set in October usually covers the October to March main crop as the countries’ cocoa regulators tend to adjust the farmer price for the April to September mid-crop – considered to be of lower quality.\n\n\n\nLast October, Ivory Coast set its main crop price at about $5,000 a metric ton while Ghana set it at nearly $5,300 per metric ton.\n\n\n\nWorld cocoa price futures CCc2 have plunged to around $3,100 per ton, however, having lost half their value this year alone.\n\n\n\nFor global cocoa traders, the price plunge had the immediate impact of landing them with steep losses if they purchased Ivorian and Ghanaian beans and sold them at futures market rates. As a result, they mostly stopped buying them.\n\n\n\nGhanaian farmers said last month they had not been paid for their beans since November, while industry sources told Reuters the situation was similar for Ivorian farmers. They noted that unsold cocoa stocks have piled up across Ivory Coast.\n\n\n\nIvory Coast resumes cocoa sales after months-long pricing dispute - Report\n\n\n\nWhat have Ivory Coast, Ghana done so far in response?\n\n\n\nTo try get cash to farmers, Ivory Coast’s government launched a programme late last month to buy 100,000 tons of unsold, main crop cocoa stocks from farmers at a cost of half a billion dollars.\n\n\n\nIn Ghana, the cocoa regulator on February 12 cut the fixed farmer price by nearly a third to around $3,580 per ton after it estimated the country had about 50,000 tons worth of unsold cocoa stocks.\n\n\n\nIvory Coast is also planning, from March 1, to lower its fixed farmer price by about a third in the hope of providing an incentive for sales to international traders, sources told Reuters.\n\n\n\nThe government said earlier this week it will announce a new farmer price by the end of February, a month earlier than usual.\n\n\n\nWhy did cocoa prices plunge?\n\n\n\nAfter nearly tripling to record levels in 2024, world cocoa prices CCc2 have since lost about three quarters of their value.\n\n\n\nThe plunge came about in part because demand fell as high prices led chocolate-makers to reduce bar sizes, increase non-cocoa additives, such as wafers or nuts, and substitute products like cocoa butter with alternative fats.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, favourable weather has led to bigger and healthier crops, leaving the global market set to record a surplus of around 300,000-400,000 tons this season, according to global traders.\n\n\n\nMuch of that surplus is in Ivory Coast and Ghana which, unlike global traders or processors, do not have the financial means or the capacity to store beans in warehouses.\n\n\n\nThere is a roughly year-long lag between the price of cocoa on futures markets and any impact on chocolate sold to retail consumers.\n\n\n\nHow important is cocoa to Ivory Coast's and Ghana's economies\n\n\n\nCocoa accounts for nearly 40% of Ivory Coast’s export revenue and nearly 15% of Ghana’s, making the crop one of the biggest sources of foreign exchange earnings for the two West African nations.\n\n\n\nUnlike Ivory Coast, Ghana is also struggling to recover from its deepest economic crisis in a generation after it defaulted on and then restructured much of its $30 billion overseas debt.\n\n\n\nThe crisis has made it much harder and more costly for Ghana’s cocoa regulator to get financing for cocoa purchases.\n\n\n\nNearly 2 million Ghanaian and Ivorian cocoa farmers and their dependents, most of whom live below the poverty line, rely on the chocolate ingredient for their livelihoods.\n\n\n\nAuto dealers respond to 15% price cut announcement"

            "content": "General News of Friday, 27 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nThe Chief Executive of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA), Julius Neequaye Kotey, has — on more than one occasion — found himself at the center of national conversation, proving that in Ghana, conversations about cars can quickly turn into conversations about policy, politics, and public trust.\n\n\n\nFrom number plates to bribery claims and overseas expansion plans, Kotey’s tenure has produced moments that sparked intense debate across radio stations, social media timelines, and the ever-vibrant Ghanaian WhatsApp groups.\n\n\n\nHere is a breakdown of three key moments that put the DVLA boss firmly in the public spotlight:\n\n\n\n1. The number plate reform controversy\n\n\n\nKotey first drew widespread attention during discussions surrounding the rollout of enhanced and digitalised vehicle number plates.\n\n\n\nIn defending the reform, he disclosed that a notable percentage of number plates in circulation were fake — a revelation that startled many motorists who suddenly began wondering whether the car next to them at the traffic light was legally “identified” or simply creatively registered.\n\n\n\nThe DVLA maintained that the upgraded plates were necessary to curb fraud, improve vehicle traceability, and modernise Ghana’s road identification system. However, critics argued that the rollout came with insufficient public education and raised concerns about affordability.\n\n\n\nFor many drivers, the question was simple: Was the reform about security — or another unexpected expense added to Ghana’s already long list of vehicle-related costs?\n\n\n\nDVLA rolls out '26' number plates, delays new digital system over unpassed regulations\n\n\n\n2. The GH¢4 million bribery claim\n\n\n\nPublic debate intensified when Kotey, in an interview with journalist Saddick Adams, revealed that he had allegedly rejected a GH¢4 million bribe intended to halt the digital number plate initiative.\n\n\n\nThe claim immediately set off mixed reactions nationwide.\n\n\n\nSupporters praised what they saw as a bold anti-corruption stance, applauding him for resisting pressure. Others, however, asked the inevitable Ghanaian follow-up question: “So who offered the money?”\n\n\n\nCritics wondered why the alleged perpetrators were not publicly identified or formally prosecuted before the disclosure was made. The matter eventually attracted the attention of the Office of the Special Prosecutor, adding another layer of intrigue to an already headline-grabbing revelation.\n\n\n\nFor days, the public debated not just the allegation itself, but whether corruption claims should begin in the courtroom rather than on the airwaves.\n\n\n\n3. Proposal to extend DVLA services abroad\n\n\n\nAnother round of backlash emerged after comments suggesting plans to extend DVLA services to Ghanaians living abroad, including those in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n\n\n\nWhile the idea appeared aimed at improving services for the diaspora, critics argued that DVLA should first resolve local service challenges — including long queues, processing delays, and the familiar Ghanaian experience of arriving early only to hear, “The system is down.”\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs later clarified that it had not approved the deployment of DVLA staff overseas. The DVLA subsequently explained that any future services outside Ghana would instead be facilitated through diplomatic missions rather than permanent staff postings abroad.\n\n\n\nTogether, these incidents have fueled ongoing national discussions about communication, transparency, and public engagement as the DVLA pursues its modernisation agenda.\n\n\n\nMRA/MA\n\n\n\nGhanaian man and his Nigerian girlfriend found dead in Morocco apartment"

            "content": "Cocoa is a key export commodity for Ghana and Ivory Coast\n\nIvory Coast plans to bring forward the start of its cocoa mid-crop season for the first time ever, allowing the regulator to sharply reduce its set price paid to farmers in ‌hopes of boosting sales, two government sources and two regulator sources told Reuters.\n\nThe measures are intended to help the ‌world's biggest producer address a crisis of excess stock resulting from a slump in global prices. The drop has made Ivorian cocoa too expensive, resulting in unsold ​bags of cocoa beans piling up both inland and at the country's ports in recent months.\n\n\n\nIvory Coast follows Ghana, the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, which cut the price paid to farmers earlier this month to align them with global markets.\n\n\n\nCocoa produced in Ivory Coast next month will now be classified as mid-crop rather than main crop and the price farmers are paid will be set at between 800 and ‌1,000 CFA francs ($1.45 and $1.81) per kg, sharply below ⁠the main crop price of 2,800 CFA francs.\n\n\n\nThe mid-crop has covered cocoa produced between April and September but will shift to start in March and end a month earlier at the end of August, ⁠the sources said.\n\n\n\nIn a bid to get cash to farmers who had not been paid for their main crop beans, Ivory Coast's Coffee and Cocoa Council in late January pledged to buy 100,000 tons of unsold cocoa at a cost of about $500 million.\n\n\n\nThe West African country's government is ​discussing ​other means that could help the struggling sector to adapt to the ​current situation, the four sources told Reuters.\n\nThe current price ‌that farmers receive was set at the start of the 2025/26 crop season. The country is expected to announce the new rate at the end of the month, the agriculture minister said on Monday.\n\n\n\nFollowing Ghana\n\n\n\nThe changes were approved after last week's meeting of the interministerial committee responsible for raw materials, the sources said.\n\n\n\n\"We are going to change the opening dates of our cocoa seasons because we need to adapt and be realistic,\" a government source told Reuters.\n\n\n\n\"The interministerial committee has already approved these changes, which will take effect ‌on March 1, 2026, with the official launch of the mid-crop campaign,\" ​another government source said.\n\n\n\nWhen neighbouring Ghana cut the price paid to cocoa farmers ​earlier this month to spur more demand it also ​announced a new financing model for bean purchases aimed at supporting farmers following the plunge in global ‌prices.\n\n\"Every day, prices continue to fall despite our efforts... ​We must be realistic and adapt ​like our neighbours in Ghana,\" said the second government source.\n\n\n\nOne source said that while Ivory Coast's government has promised to purchase beans from farmers, it also has to pay them a difference between the state-guaranteed price and the price paid ​by exporters.\n\n\n\n\"We are paying a subsidy of ‌1,900 to 2,200 CFA francs per kilogram to maintain this guaranteed price and to export the beans,\" the source ​said.\n\n\n\n\"This is completely unsustainable in the long term and for the country.\""

            "content": "Business News of Friday, 27 February 2026\n\nSource: www.ghanaweb.com\n\nThe Minority in Parliament has been accused of embarking on a smear campaign to denigrate distinguished technocrats at COCOBOD, following what critics describe as a failed attempt by some \"rented farmers\" to tarnish the image of the cocoa regulator.\n\n\n\nThe accusations follow allegations by members of the Minority New Patriotic Party (NPP), led by the Member of Parliament for Old Tafo, Vincent Ekow Assafuah, against the Deputy Chief Executive of COCOBOD in charge of Finance and Administration, Ato Boateng.\n\n\n\nAssafuah has petitioned the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) and the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to probe what they describe as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n\n\nAssafuah has questioned COCOBOD's continued business engagement with Atlas Commodities Limited, citing Boateng's previous professional association with the company as grounds for concern.\n\n\n\nHowever, Boateng resigned as a director of Atlas Commodities Limited on January 20, 2025, prior to his appointment to COCOBOD in February 2025. He also transferred all his shares in the company to Edinam Yao Cofie and George Ofori, who now manage them as trustees.\n\n\n\nTo ensure full transparency and compliance with public service regulations, Boateng stated that he declared his previous interest in Atlas Commodities in his official Declaration of Assets and Liabilities, which has been duly lodged with the Auditor-General.\n\n\n\nObservers argue that the focus on Boateng ignores his broader professional background, including his previous role at the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group.\n\n\n\nIn January 2026, the IFC injected more than $100 million to address a critical funding shortfall in Ghana's cocoa sector, with potential additional support expected to reach $300 million this year.\n\n\n\nAlthough Boateng worked with the IFC from August 2007 to October 2015, this association has not been questioned by Assafuah and his colleagues, even after COCOBOD secured millions of dollars from the IFC.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Ato Boateng, in a public statement, described the Minority's allegations as “frivolous” but welcomed calls for an investigation.\n\n\n\nCritics of the Minority insist that the persistent attacks by Vincent Ekow Assafuah and his colleagues are an attempt to manufacture what they describe as a \"non-existent scandal,\" particularly at a time when COCOBOD is working to manage billions of legacy debts inherited from the erstwhile NPP administration.\n\n\n\nA former leading member of the NPP, now Director of Field Operations for the United Party, Hopeson Adorye, has described the Minority as being “in deep waters, fishing for a scandal to tag this government. That is all.”\n\n\n\nHe told Joy News' AM Show on Tuesday, February 24, 2026: \"All they are doing is just fishing for a scandal that does not exist.”\n\n\n\nMP Damata demands reversal of cocoa price cut, electricity tariff hike\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the attacks on Boateng are being viewed by some as a setback to calls by industry watchers for successive governments to appoint technocrats to manage state institutions.\n\n\n\nFor instance, a Senior Lecturer at the University of Cape Coast, Dr Frank Ackah, recently told The High Street Journal that the cocoa sector requires structural reform and stronger professional leadership.\n\n\n\nThe agronomist proposed replacing political nominees with independent technocrats.\n\n\n\n\"Let's not appoint politicians; let's bring in technocrats and professionals to run the Cocoa Board,\" he argued.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Dr John Kwakye, Director of Research at the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), has advocated competence-based appointments in public institutions. In a post shared on X last year, he stated: “Public appointments should have a balance between elected politicians and unelected technocrats. Ministers can be politicians.\n\n\n\nBut CEOs of SOEs and regulatory bodies, such as the central bank and accountable institutions, should ideally be technocrats.\"\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, procurement experts familiar with COCOBOD's internal systems have dismissed claims that a single official could unilaterally influence contract awards.\n\n\n\nCOCOBOD prepares a consolidated institutional budget from its various departments.\n\n\n\nFrom the approved budget, a procurement plan is extracted.\n\n\n\nThe procurement plan must be approved by the Entity Tender Committee and the Board of COCOBOD.\n\n\n\nProcurement processes are governed by the Public Procurement Act and must also receive approval from the Public Procurement Authority (PPA).\n\n\n\nSupporters of Boateng argue that targeting technocrats discourages qualified professionals from accepting public appointments and undermines broader calls for merit-based governance.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb's exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

            "content": "The event brought together policymakers, industry leaders, development partners and students\n\nThe Director-General of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NaCCA), Professor Samuel Bekoe, has declared that Ghana’s education system is no longer preparing learners for a stable world but for one defined by rapid disruption, artificial intelligence and automation.\n\nSpeaking at the 5th Edition of the Annual Impact Roundtable Discussion (AIRTAD) and Robotics Competition 2026 on February 26, 2026, Professor Bekoe said the theme for this year, “Shaping Tomorrow’s Workforce Through Education and Innovation” sits at the very heart of NaCCA’s mandate.\n\n\n\n“We are no longer preparing learners for a world that stays still; we are preparing them for a world of rapid disruption, artificial intelligence and automated systems,” he stated.\n\n\n\n“Our mandate has been clear: to transform the Ghanaian educational landscape from a system of mere ‘chill and recall’ to one of ‘think and create.’”\n\n\n\nProfessor Bekoe noted that through the Standards-Based Curriculum and the Common Core Programme, technology has been integrated not as an isolated subject but as a foundational language for the 21st-century learner.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Director-General of the Ghana Education Service (GES), Dr Olivia Serwaa Opare, Director of the STEM Unit, described the gathering as more than just an event.\n\n\n\n“This is not just a robotics competition. It is a statement of intent, a collective commitment to shaping the future of education and preparing our young people for the rapidly evolving world of work,” she said.\n\nDr Opare emphasised that globally, education systems are being challenged by technological change, artificial intelligence, automation and new economic realities. Many of the jobs today’s students will occupy in the future, she noted, do not yet exist.\n\n\n\nShe highlighted Ghana’s bold reforms through the Standards-Based Curriculum and the National STEM agenda, which have shifted the system from memorisation to creativity, inquiry and practical problem-solving.\n\n\n\nHowever, she cautioned that curriculum reform alone cannot transform learning.\n\n\n\n“Transformation happens when learners are given environments where they can experiment, design, fail safely, try again, and ultimately create solutions,” she explained.\n\n\n\nDr Opare praised the Yamoransa Model Labs Programme as a practical demonstration of meaningful STEM education, especially in underserved communities by introducing makerspaces, robotics, coding and hands-on science learning, she said the initiative bridges the gap between theory and practice.\n\n\n\n“It allows students not only to learn science, but to do science. Not only to study technology, but to create technology,” she stressed.\n\nProfessor Kofi Sarpong Adu Manu, Associate Professor at the Computer Science Department of the University of Ghana, underscored the importance of government-private sector collaboration in sustaining STEM education.\n\n\n\nHe noted that while previous administrations made significant strides in promoting STEM, continuity and strong public-private partnerships would ensure long-term sustainability.\n\n\n\n“Government has the authority and resources. Partnering with the private sector to support STEM education will make the initiative sustainable,” he said.\n\n\n\nLaurin Assiamah-Yeboah, Head of Portfolio and Operations for IMPLEMENTERS, revealed that discussions are underway with partners to scale the model and align it with Ghana’s national curriculum.\n\n\n\n“At the end of the day, if students are taught science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics without practical spaces to apply them, the learning does not last,” she explained. “When we provide the facilities and the environment, learning becomes practical and meaningful.”\n\n\n\nShe expressed optimism that STEM education would significantly transform Ghana’s educational sector in the coming years, urging stakeholders to act with urgency.\n\n“This is not tomorrow’s conversation; it is today’s responsibility,” she added.\n\n\n\nCountry Director of UNESCO Ghana, Edmond Moukala, linked the initiative to the global 2030 Agenda, particularly Sustainable Development Goal 4, which seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all.\n\n\n\nHe commended organisations translating global education frameworks into tangible classroom experiences, stressing that innovation must become a right for the many and not a privilege for the few.\n\n\n\nCounsellor and Deputy Head of Mission at the Embassy of Japan in Ghana, Naoki Mitori, also encouraged young people to believe in their potential.\n\n\n\n“Ghana is a land of promise and possibilities. If you believe in your potential and give your best effort, you will be able to achieve your dreams,” he said, congratulating organisers and stakeholders for their commitment.\n\n\n\nThe 2026 edition is particularly significant as it marks five years of AIRTAD, a flagship initiative assessing the impact of the Yamoransa Model Labs Programme while celebrating innovation, creativity and problem-solving among young people in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM).\n\nThe event, organised by IMPLEMENTERS, brought together policymakers, industry leaders, development partners and students from Ghana, Liberia and The Gambia to engage in critical discussions on the future of education and workforce development in Africa.\n\n\n\nAM\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, watch GhanaWeb’s exposé on the 'dark side of Kayamata' and its devastating impact"

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "A local governor says authorities found two mass graves in the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira which the rebel M23 group seized in December.\n\nCongolese authorities and a civil society group have said that mass graves were found in a part of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where the M23 rebel group has recently withdrawn from, as fighting in the region escalates despite a United States-mediated peace deal.\n\nThe governor of South Kivu province, Jean-Jacques Purusi, told The Associated Press news agency on Thursday that authorities found two mass graves with at least 171 bodies in the Kiromoni and Kavimvira neighbourhoods on the outskirts of the eastern city of Uvira.\n\n“At this stage, we have identified two sites: one mass grave containing approximately 30 bodies in Kiromoni, not far from the Burundian border on the Congolese side, and another in Kavimvira where 141 bodies were found,” Purusi told AP over the phone.\n\nThe Executive Secretariat of the Local Network for the Protection of Civilians, a civil society group in the region, said on Thursday it wanted to visit the mass graves but was prevented from doing so by the Congolese military.\n\nInformation gathered so far indicates that the victims were killed by M23 rebels, said Yves Ramadhani, the group’s vice president.\n\nThe governor and the civil society group alleged that the rebels killed the individuals because they suspected them of belonging to the DRC army or a pro-government militia.\n\nBoth the DRC military and M23 have been accused of extrajudicial killings and abuses by rights groups. Al Jazeera could not independently verify Purusi’s or the group’s claims.\n\n\n\nThe M23 is the most prominent of the more than 100 armed groups that are vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern DRC, near the border with Rwanda.\n\nM23 has been in a tense and violent conflict with the DRC government for more than a decade. The first fighting began in 2012 but de-escalated the next year, only to resume in 2021.\n\nThen, in January 2025, the rebels gained ground, seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, before taking Bukavu, the capital of neighbouring South Kivu, the following month. And in December, the group seized control of Uvira in an offensive that killed more than 1,500 people and forced about 300,000 to flee, according to regional authorities.\n\nThe rebel group later announced it would withdraw from the city, in what it said was a “unilateral trust-building measure” requested by the US to facilitate the peace process.\n\nM23 claims it is fighting for the rights of the minority Tutsi community, who it says has been marginalised by the state. The DRC government has condemned the rebels and neighbouring Rwanda, which it accuses of supporting them, for seizing land and resources.\n\nLast year, two separate peace negotiation processes took place – one between DRC and M23 mediated by Qatar, and a separate one between Kinshasa and Kigali mediated by the US.\n\nDespite agreed ceasefires, fighting has continued in the east of the country.\n\nThe conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than seven million people displaced, according to the UN agency for refugees, and thousands killed.\n\nMore than 200 people were also killed in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern DRC last month."

            "content": "Critics are wary of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to send the military to tackle crime, drugs and gangs in three provinces.\n\nCape Town, South Africa – Two ominous letters are spray-painted on a wall at the entrance to Tafelsig, a township in Mitchells Plain on the outskirts of Cape Town: HL – the insignia of the Hard Livings gang, which has threatened communities there for five decades.\n\nIt’s a February day soon after the president’s state of the nation address, in which Cyril Ramaphosa boldly announced he’d be deploying the army to communities across South Africa to tackle the growing crisis of crime, drugs and gangs. But in Tafelsig, which will likely be part of the new military operation, most people seem unbothered by the news.\n\nMitchells Plain is on the Cape Flats – a series of densely populated, impoverished townships about 30km (19 miles) southeast of the wealthy city centre where the president made his speech. While the city boasts hordes of tourists and some of the most expensive real estate on the continent, the Cape Flats accounts for the highest rate of gang-related killings in the country.\n\n“When it was at its worst, [there was a shooting] almost every day,” said Michael Jacobs, the chairperson of a local community police forum.\n\n“Whether it’s day or whether it’s night, they’re shooting somewhere on the Cape Flats,” he added on a drive through the settlement of run-down houses and corrugated iron shacks.\n\nAround him, residents made their way to a home-grown tuck shop, known as a spaza, or sat on street corners while toddlers ran about.\n\n“How is this conducive to raising children?” he asked, recounting the horrors of life in Mitchells Plain.\n\n\n\nIn the past week, four people, including a nine-month-old, had been shot and killed in a drug den in Athlone, about 17km (10 miles) away.\n\nA beloved Muslim cleric who is rumoured to have angered a gang leader over a personal dispute was also shot dead on the first day of Ramadan as he was leaving the Salaamudien Mosque on a nearby street.\n\nAs Jacobs spoke, reports of other shootings filtered through on the many crime groups he is part of on WhatsApp. A few days later, he shared with Al Jazeera a video of two schoolgirls and a taxi driver shot outside a school in Atlantis, about 40km (25 miles) north of Cape Town. One of the girls died.\n\nTafelsig residents now await the probable arrival of uniformed soldiers and armed vehicles in their neighbourhood, but have little hope that it will make a difference.\n\nDespite his weariness with the violence, Jacobs is far from enthusiastic about a decision to deploy the army.\n\nOther critics of the government’s decision said it is window dressing more than a real solution while some question the wisdom of such a drastic step in a country where the military has a history of brutality and where recent explosive allegations about police corruption at the highest levels have surfaced.\n\n‘Do our lives not matter?’\n\nIn his speech on February 12, Ramaphosa said he would deploy the army to the Western Cape, the province that includes the Cape Flats, and Gauteng, home to the country’s largest city, Johannesburg, to tackle gang violence and illegal mining. On February 17, Acting Police Minister Firoz Cachalia announced that the Eastern Cape would be added to the list and a deployment would take place in 10 days – although no soldiers have so far been deployed.\n\nThe president’s decision followed pressure from civil society groups and the Democratic Alliance (DA) party, which runs the Western Cape, to take drastic action to curb widespread gang-related violence in the three provinces.\n\nA day before its province was added to the deployment schedule, the DA joined residents in Gqeberha, the largest city in the Eastern Cape, for a “Do Our Lives Not Matter?” protest to demand that Ramaphosa take urgent action.\n\nIn Gauteng, neighbourhoods surrounding the province’s once-lucrative abandoned mines have often been turned into battlegrounds, resulting in shootouts between police and illegal artisanal miners, known as zama zamas.\n\nGauteng and the Western Cape frequently appear at the top of the country’s organised crime lists while the Eastern Cape made headlines last year for a series of killings linked to extortion syndicates.\n\n\n\nIn the latest crime statistics, police announced the arrests of 15,846 suspects nationwide and the seizure of 173 firearms and 2,628 rounds of ammunition from February 16 to Sunday alone.\n\nGauteng took up the most space in the police’s crime highlights, which included a 16-year-old arrested in Roodepoort for possession and distribution of explosives and the seizure of counterfeit clothing and shoes worth 98 million rand ($6.1m).\n\nOverall, South Africa has some of the world’s most violent crime with an average of 64 people killed every day, according to official statistics.\n\nThe three provinces selected for military deployments have a turbulent history with the armed forces, not least during the apartheid era when the regime used soldiers to unleash deadly crackdowns on antiapartheid activists.\n\n“They were the enemy,” Jacobs said, recalling his own arrest in September 1987 during a student protest on the Cape Flats opposing the racist government, which was replaced in the country’s first democratic elections in 1994.\n\nToday after three decades of democracy, poverty, unemployment and violent crime remain a major challenge in the area.\n\nBut Jacobs, like other critics of the military police, believes the new move will do little to cure the ills that he said gangs exploit to increase their influence. Children as young as eight years old are recruited into their ranks.\n\nThe Town Centre, a shopping mall that was once a hub of economic activity, has been reduced to a ghost town where the drug trade thrives despite the fact that it is right next to a police station, according to Jacobs.\n\nFor him, there is a direct link between the country’s economic decline and the flourishing of gang activity over the past decade on the Cape Flats, where working-class people have seen their livelihoods stripped away as the manufacturing sector shrank.\n\nOn an average weekday when children should be at school, he said, you see children and even women in their 60s in Mitchells Plain digging through rubbish bins to find glass, plastic or other things they can recycle and turn into income. “At least it will put something on the table.”\n\nPlugging a ‘haemorrhage’\n\nSocial issues and not simply military intervention should be put at the heart of government anticrime efforts, analysts say.\n\n“There’s no other way to describe it other than plugging a hole that is haemorrhaging at the moment with regards to these forms of organised crime,” said Ryan Cummings, director of analysis at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused risk management firm.\n\nIrvin Kinnes, an associate professor with the University of Cape Town’s Centre for Criminology, pointed out that constitutionally the army is limited in the duties its members may perform among the civilian population. Their role will be largely to support police, who will retain control of all operations.\n\nHe fears the government has not learned lessons from previous army deployments in South Africa’s democratic era.\n\n\n\nThe army was dispatched to the Western Cape in 2019 during a previous spike in gang violence and was again sent in to help with the enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions the following year.\n\n“It’s a very dangerous thing to bring the army because there’s an impatience with the fact that the police are not doing their job. And so they come in with that mentality and want to beat up everybody and break people’s bones,” Kinnes said.\n\n“We saw what happened in COVID. They killed people as the army. It’s not as if the police don’t kill people, but the point is, you don’t need the army to do that.”\n\nTo the government’s detractors, summoning the army is nothing more than an attempt at political heroics before local elections due to be held this year or in early 2027.\n\nKinnes pointed out that, according to police statistics, crime has been decreasing without the help of the army.\n\n“It’s very much political. It’s to show that the political leaders have kind of heard the public. But the call for the army hasn’t come from the community. It’s come from politicians,” he said.\n\n‘The military is ready’\n\nRamaphosa, who has yet to reveal details of the military deployment, has defended his decision. On Monday in his weekly newsletter, the president sought to separate the South African armed forces from their troubling past, listing several operations that benefitted communities, such as disaster relief efforts and law enforcement operations at the border.\n\nHe made it clear that the army’s role would merely be a supporting one “with clear rules of engagement and for specific time-limited objectives”.\n\nIts presence may free up officers to focus on police work and would take place alongside other measures, such as strengthening antigang units and illegal mining teams, he said.\n\n“Given our history, where the apartheid state sent the army into townships to violently suppress opposition, it is important that we do not deploy the [military] inside the country to deal with domestic threats without good reason,” Ramaphosa wrote.\n\nCummings said it was clear the president’s hand was forced amid an unrelenting wave of violence. “The rhetoric of the president up until now suggests that this was a directive that he was not necessarily too keen on implementing.”\n\nOn the ground, soldiers appear equally reluctant about their pending engagement.\n\nNtsiki Shongo is a soldier who was deployed in 2019 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. He told Al Jazeera, using a pseudonym, that any operation involving the police was almost certainly doomed.\n\n“We [in the army] become so negative when we are working with them [the police] because always we don’t get what we need,” he said.\n\n“We know how easy it is to get these gangsters, to get these drug lords, but unfortunately, the police, they are not cooperating with us because some of them are in cooperation with these criminals,” he charged. “Maybe they are scared for their lives because they are staying in the same areas with them.”\n\nShongo referred to an ongoing commission investigating police corruption that has implicated senior government officials and led to the suspension of national Police Minister Senzo Mchunu.\n\n“So this operation, … is it going to be a success? I don’t know. It all depends on the police,” he said, adding that he and his fellow soldiers long for the day the government lets the military solve the problem on its own.\n\n\n\n“Even when we are just sitting having lunch as soldiers, we talk about the police. We pray that one day the state can say, ‘Let’s take the military inside the country and clean out all these weapons, all these guns, all these gangsters,’” he said.\n\n“The military is ready, and they want to prove a point because we’ve been hungry for these things.”"

            "content": "Probe of Royal Air Force bases comes amid concerns trafficked women were brought to UK on board Epstein’s private jets.\n\nUK Defence Secretary John Healey has called for an investigation into whether convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein trafficked women and girls into the United Kingdom on private jets that landed at Britain’s Royal Air Force (RAF) bases.\n\nBritish newspaper The Telegraph reported on Thursday that Healey had told UK officials to search through two decades of Ministry of Defence files and “leave no stone unturned” in the hunt for any links between the late paedophile’s private jet and RAF facilities.\n\nThe investigation launched by Healey comes days after former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown urged police to investigate whether the former prince, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, had used taxpayer-funded jet travel and RAF bases to meet with Epstein.\n\nThe Telegraph reported that Brown was particularly concerned about a private flight Epstein took on a Gulfstream jet that landed at an airbase in Norfolk in December 2000, before he visited the royal retreat of Sandringham with Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nMountbatten-Windsor was arrested last week over alleged misconduct in public office, while serving as the UK trade envoy, for reportedly sending confidential government documents to Epstein.\n\nUK, EU to ‘look into’ Mandelson’s Epstein ties\n\nThe UK’s Intelligence and Security Committee said on Thursday it hopes it will soon be able to publish documents shedding light on how political insider Peter Mandelson was appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the UK’s ambassador to the United States, despite his longtime ties to Epstein being well known.\n\n\n\n“We are proceeding at pace to publish the first tranche of documents in early March,” a spokesperson for the intelligence committee said.\n\nMandelson, 72, was briefly arrested and then released by London’s Metropolitan Police as part of their investigation.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Starmer fired Mandelson as ambassador last year following more revelations about his relationship with Epstein, the British leader is facing political fallout as questions remain over his decision to appoint him to the role of ambassador in the first place.\n\nThe European Union’s anti-fraud office OLAF also said on Thursday that it was looking into Mandelson’s actions while he was serving in Brussels as British commissioner for trade between 2004 and 2008, following a request from the European Commission."

            "content": "Ottawa say India is no longer a ‘security threat’ after allegations of transnational violence rocked bilateral ties, even as Canadian Sikh activists live under threat. Can Carney’s India visit reset relations?\n\nAs officials in Ottawa were preparing for Prime Minister Mark Carney’s maiden visit to India, Canadian police were knocking on a Sikh activist’s door in Surrey, Vancouver, on Sunday to inform him that his life was at risk.\n\nMoninder Singh, who heads the Sikh Federation of Canada, had previously already received three such warnings from the Vancouver police. But this time, citing a confidential informant, police told Singh that his wife and two children were at risk, too.\n\n“I was told to make sure it’s extended to you, your wife and your two children,” the police officer told Singh in a conversation recorded on his home’s doorbell camera.\n\nSingh was an associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh activist and Canadian citizen who was assassinated in Canada in June 2023. The killing caused a massive diplomatic row. Canada accused Indian government agents of involvement in Nijjar’s killing, and framed it as part of an Indian policy of transnational repression targeting Sikh activists abroad.\n\nBut, while Singh was informed of the threat to him and his family on Sunday, a senior Canadian government official told reporters in an off-the-record briefing on Wednesday that “India is no longer a threat” to security, two days before Carney was due to land in New Delhi.\n\nThis marks a significant shift in Canada’s tone and approach to India under Carney, who is looking to diversify foreign relations to cushion the impact from United States President Donald Trump’s trade war, analysts say.\n\nObservers say Carney’s visit to New Delhi this week could mark the start of a reset of the bilateral relationship, which hit new lows in recent years under Canada’s former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe rupture in ties\n\nThe mood in Ottawa had already changed a great deal since Carney succeeded Trudeau to lead the government in March last year.\n\n\n\nUnder Trudeau, relations between Canada and India had deteriorated to tit-for-tat accusations and the expulsion of diplomats, particularly since the killing of Nijjar in June 2023.\n\nNijjar was a prominent advocate for a Sikh homeland in the form of an independent Khalistani state in India. New Delhi calls this separatism and views Nijjar and others in the movement as “terrorists”.\n\nFollowing Nijjar’s killing, pressure mounted on Trudeau from the influential Sikh diaspora in Canada, demanding accountability. In October 2024, during an inquiry into foreign interference, Trudeau said there were “ever clearer indications” that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty by targeting Sikh activists on Canadian soil.\n\nIndia’s “actions”, Trudeau said, were a “horrific mistake”.\n\nCanada also accused India of interfering in its domestic politics, including by providing funds to politicians whom New Delhi preferred. India firmly rejected the allegations, calling them “preposterous”, and urged Canada to take action against anti-Indian elements operating from its soil – an apparent reference to Sikh activists.\n\nBut Nijjar’s killing opened a can of worms for the Indian establishment. In November 2023, the US Department of Justice charged an Indian national with allegedly plotting to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, an American lawyer and also a Sikh activist.\n\nNikhil Gupta, 54, accused of plotting to kill Pannun, pleaded guilty to three criminal charges in a federal court in New York City earlier this month. He faces up to 40 years in prison for admitting to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nSikh activists in the United Kingdom were also reportedly warned of a threat from the Indian government.\n\nTrudeau’s approach to the issue, in some sense, had become emblematic of the problem in bilateral ties, said Harsh Pant, a foreign policy analyst in New Delhi.\n\nHis confrontational approach “meant that issues that could have been dealt with at the bureaucratic level were elevated to the strategic level”, and it became difficult to disentangle the two, he added.\n\nThaw in icy relations\n\nWhen Carney was elected new leader of the ruling Liberal Party in 2025, he replaced Justin Trudeau amid historic tensions with the United States and fears of a trade war with the Trump administration. Carney took the stage, actively looking for new partners to mitigate this threat.\n\n\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi leapt to congratulate him and immediately called on him “to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people”.\n\nSoon, Carney had invited Modi to Canada for the G7 summit in June last year, where both leaders met on the sidelines. New envoys in both countries followed. Suddenly, everything had changed in the relationship, said Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based analyst on South Asia.\n\n“There is just more optimism and momentum for the relationship,” Kugelman told Al Jazeera. Under Carney, the Canadian government “recognises that this relationship is too important to let it flounder”.\n\nThe commercial incentives for Canada to get the relationship back on track are huge. “And that all starts with changing the tone and the mood,” Kugelman said. Hence, this week’s comments by Canadian officials that “India is no longer a threat”.\n\nVina Nadjibulla, vice president at the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, told Al Jazeera that Ottawa has moved from a public, crisis-driven posture to a more deliberate, step-by-step “reset”.\n\nUnder Carney, “the emphasis is on rebuilding structured channels so security concerns – including transnational repression and interference – can be handled through sustained law enforcement and national security cooperation rather than megaphone diplomacy,” she argued.\n\n“Ottawa is trying to do both at once: defend the rule of law at home while advancing areas of mutual interest abroad.”\n\nBut Carney’s change in approach does not mean the problem of threats against Sikh activists has vanished.\n\n“Canadian officials definitely still worry about the transnational repression issue, and particularly as legal proceedings continue,” said Kugelman.\n\nThe current Canadian government is merely taking a different approach, he suggested: “a more ‘accommodationist’ approach – one that focuses on essentially working through this issue with India”.\n\nUnlike the Canadian officials in their off-the-record briefing, Foreign Minister Anita Anand evaded a direct question from reporters when quizzed about whether India is no longer considered a threat. Instead, she said, discussions on the issues of transnational violence are ongoing at the highest levels of both governments.\n\nNew Delhi will also want to address the challenges of “Khalistani extremism”, which will be a challenge for Carney, said Pant, who is vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank.\n\nThe way forward\n\nOn Friday, Carney began his two-day visit to New Delhi, where the two prime ministers are holding talks at Hyderabad House and will review the India-Canada Strategic Partnership.\n\nThe Canadian PM is also expected to lock in deals on trade and investment, including on energy, critical minerals, agriculture, education, research and people-to-people ties.\n\n\n\nCollaboration in these sectors will define the trajectory of this relationship going forward, said Pant.\n\nUltimately, the key external factor driving Carney’s visit to New Delhi is Trump’s trade war, said Kugelman. Both Canada and India have seen their relations with the US, a top trade partner, slide since Trump returned to the White House in January last year.\n\nWhile India has somewhat stabilised its relations with the US this year since trade negotiations reached the final stages, Ottawa and Washington remain at odds over their worldviews and international trade.\n\n“[Carney’s approach] is part of a broader global trend that we’re seeing, countries that have worked with the US for a long time are now looking to strengthen ties with other partners,” said Kugelman. “From the perspective of Ottawa and New Delhi, it’s really a no-brainer that this relationship not only has to get back on track, but it also needs to be put in a position where it can grow even more.”\n\nNadjibulla of the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada added that India is key to Canada’s efforts to reduce over-reliance on the US and to diversify its economic and strategic partnerships.\n\nBut unresolved issues, like the ones of transnational violence, undermine the durability of now-blooming bilateral ties, she added.\n\n“If unresolved security allegations sit in the background without credible processes and enforcement cooperation, normalisation becomes politically brittle,” Nadjibulla told Al Jazeera. “Vulnerable to the next incident, leak, or court development.”"

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” – a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

Copilot Tasks will provide a report once its work is complete.\n\nYou can call upon Copilot Tasks to do things like organize your subscriptions and cancel the ones you don’t use, as well as turn emails, attachments, and images from your inbox into a slide deck. Some other use cases include having the AI assistant surface urgent emails and draft replies, plan a birthday party from venue to invites; and keep tabs on new apartment listings every Friday, even setting up home tours.\n\nMicrosoft says that Tasks will ask for permission before performing “meaningful actions,” like making a payment or sending a message for you. For now, Copilot Tasks is only available in a research preview with a “small group” of testers. You can join a waitlist for Copilot Tasks from Microsoft’s website."

The company will shrink from more than 10,000 people to less than 6,000, Dorsey says in a post on X. And the reason why? AI.\n\n“We’re not making this decision because we’re in trouble,” Dorsey says. “Our business is strong. Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings. In a shareholder letter, Dorsey says that “We believe Block will be significantly more valuable as a smaller, faster, intelligence-native company. Everything we do from here is in service of that.”"

Image: WindowsLatest\n\nUsers can attach the controllers with the display folded or unfolded, use the display in a vertical split screen mode, or attach it to the keyboard for laptop mode, for a total of four different form factors rolled into one device. Even the controllers are convertible: the right side controller can be used as a vertical mouse in “FPS Mode,” similar to the mouse mode on the Legion Go 2 or the Nintendo Switch 2. The right-side controller also has a built-in display that shows performance metrics and settings and doubles as a touchpad.\n\nThe Legion Go Fold is rumored to include an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V CPU, 32GB of RAM, and a 48 Whr battery. According to WindowsLatest, Lenovo plans to announce it as a concept device at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, although it likely wouldn’t be commercially available right away, if ever."

I asked Samsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the executive in charge of both R&D and operations for Samsung’s mobile business. He says the added thickness of magnets is a bad tradeoff to make, because you’re just going to buy a case anyhow.\n\n“About 80 or 90 percent of people are using a case, and cases with magnets are very popular these days,” he tells me.\n\nSamsung would rather use that extra height to give the phone a larger battery or make it thinner, he says.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Samsung isn’t looking into magnets. “We’re still doing a lot of research to make sure we don’t have any sacrifice inside the phone; when we actually achieve that, we’ll integrate,” he says.\n\nPersonally, I disagree with Choi’s premise. I want extra battery and magnets, and I’m willing to sacrifice thinness to get it. Phones are thin enough already, except for the ones that fold.\n\nAnd if Samsung took charge of the magnets like Apple, and replicated Apple’s standard pattern and strength, maybe the magnet case I use with my Galaxy S25 would properly and firmly hold onto magnetic battery packs without them rotating in place. Since there’s no magnets inside my phone, I’m at the mercy of casemakers.\n\nBut I get it. Why make the tradeoff if someone will pay for a case anyhow? Seems like we need to ask Apple and Google why they chose differently."

That’s according to the latest report from the International Data Corporation (IDC), which forecasts smartphone shipments to plummet 12.9 percent this year, marking its “lowest annual shipment volume in more than a decade.”\n\nAt the same time, the average selling price for smartphones is set to hit new highs, with IDC predicting a 14 percent increase to a record $523. “While memory prices are projected to stabilize by mid-2027, they are unlikely to return to previous level,” IDC senior researcher Nabila Popal says, adding that the sub-$100 phone segment will become “permanently uneconomical.” Next week, Apple is rumored to announce a new edition of its budget smartphone as the “iPhone 17e,” which could give a hint about where things are going.\n\nThe memory shortage is expected to impact budget-friendly Android smartphones the most, as the rising costs of components leave them with “no choice but to pass the costs on to end users,” Francisco Jeronimo, the vice president for IDC’s Worldwide Client Devices, says in the report. That could result in smaller brands exiting the industry, while allowing Apple and Samsung to grab more market share, according to Popal."

Now, Samsung is confirming what we previously only suspected: RAMageddon is partly to blame.\n\nSamsung’s Won-Joon Choi, the COO of its mobile business, tells The Verge that the memory shortage alone made a “significant contribution” to the price. All the increasing material costs factored into the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus costing $100 more than their predecessors this year, as did tariffs, but the memory was “significant,” he tells me.\n\nRelated The RAM shortage is coming for everything you care about\n\nThe S26 does come with double the storage this year at its higher price, with 256GB rather than 128GB, though its $899 price tag is still $40 higher than an S25 with 256GB cost at launch. And though tariffs may have been a factor as well, Samsung has hiked the price in other regions too, not just the United States. The pricier S26 Ultra does come with intriguing upgrades, however, including a built-in privacy screen and the largest vapor chamber cooling system in a phone.\n\nSamsung chip partner Qualcomm warned in its February quarterly results that it was seeing a big dip in its handset business “100 percent” due to the memory shortage, telling investors that the AI industry’s appetite for components would likely define the entire scale of the phone industry all year long.\n\nAnd today, IDC is forecasting the largest drop ever recorded in worldwide smartphone shipments, a dip of 12.9 percent, across 2026. “What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,” writes IDC."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop.

The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "As space companies itch to push the most advanced chips into orbit, the problem of cooling those high-powered processors is top of mind.\n\n“It’s cold in space … [but] there’s no airflow, and so the only way to dissipate is through conduction,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said when asked about space-based data centers during his firm’s most recent earnings call.\n\nNow, Sophia Space has raised $10 million from investors, including Alpha Funds, KDDI Green Partners Fund, and Unlock Venture Partners. The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are 1 meter by 1 meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, DeMillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Boston, MA | REGISTER NOW\n\nBy the 2030s, Sophia hopes to be building larger space data centers out of thousands of TILEs, envisioning a 50-meter-by-50-meter structure delivering 1 MW of computing power. DeMillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include Earth-observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” DeMillo told TechCrunch."

            "content": "Lowe’s Home Improvement grew the old-fashioned way, working its way up from a single, small, family-owned North Carolina general store founded in 1921. But the Lowe’s hardware store empire is plenty big these days. A tool-filled Lowe’s superstore is now about as big as a New York City block. The focus stays mostly on appliances and tools for the home DIYer, more than large building contractors. I like to pop in for grill and griddle tools, or just some propane. But you can also buy a pre-finished door complete with the frame—or the lumber, sanders, routers, and saws you’d use to make your own door, including the hinges and the wood stain. It’s easy to get lost in the endless aisles if you love the smell of plaster and wood dust, but it’s easier to find the best Lowe’s deals on the website. This roundup includes Lowe’s daily deals, a promo code, and Lowe's offer code for 40% off appliances, plus info on the Lowe’s rewards program and military discounts.\n\nQuick Ways to Save at Lowe’s: Text Alerts and Daily Deals\n\nLowe’s wants to be able to tell you about its deals, hoping you’ll be tempted to take advantage of them. If you’re a consistent DIYer, it’s likely worth getting a heads-up on the Lowe’s Deals of the Day, delivered to your phone via text message. This might be anything from drills to snow blowers or lawn mowers, plus the best package deals on appliances, refrigerators, washers, and dryers. Each of these deals is one-day only. If you \n\nJoin the MyLowe’s Rewards Program, Get Maximum Benefits\n\nIf you’re planning on doing some major work this year, or just like to putter around, it’s probably worth picking up a MyLowe’s Rewards Program membership. Each eligible purchase accrues points that’ll pay out in increments of $5 in-store credit at Lowe’s. Like a lot of loyalty programs, you get more benefits if you spend more at the store, including free shipping on all purchases including the small ones, member-only discounts, and point boosters for better discounts.\n\nThere are three tiers of memberships, depending what you buy. One large appliance might already qualify you for the highest tier of rewards, at which point you might as well. These are the three tiers, based on the total cost of what you’ve bought at Lowe’s in the past year. Bronze ($0-$499): $35 minimum for free shipping; 1 point per $1 spent. Silver ($500-$1,999): Free shipping; 1.25 points per $1 spent. Gold ($2,000+): Free shipping; 1.5 points per $1 spent.\n\nFor contractors, there’s a separate MyLowe’s Pro Rewards Program that offers Lowe’s in-store credit in increments of $1 for every 100 points earned. (Points expire in half-yearly increments, on June 30 and December 31.) Benefits include member-only deals, volume discounts, free standard shipping in the contiguous United States, and a 20% paint discount after annual spend of $3,000 or more. Other benefits include analytics and spend reports, online order quoting, and purchase authorization for specified crew members.\n\n10% Military Discount, Plus Free MyLowe’s Silver Status\n\nAll verified active military, veterans, and military spouses are eligible for a 10% discount on full-price items—meaning things don’t have to be on sale to be on sale. This is available through what Lowe’s calls the Everyday Military Discount program. When you enroll, you also get an immediate upgrade to Silver status on the MyLowe’s Rewards program, which means more rewards points earned per dollar, and free shipping on all orders in the contiguous United States.\n\nGet a free Silver status upgrade instantly when you enroll in our Military Discount program and validate through ID.me. MyLowe’s Rewards Silver status members receive free standard shipping (excludes AK and HI) and earn more points per dollar.\n\nSave 5% on Everyday Purchases at Lowe’s\n\nLike a lot of big retailers, Lowe’s also has a store credit card with discounts attached. The MyLowe’s Rewards Credit Card offers 5% off qualified purchases, with a whole bunch of asterisks. Specifically, the discount applies after all other discounts and can’t be combined with other programs like contractor bulk discounts, employee discounts, or military discounts. It also doesn’t work on Weber, Miele, or Kichler products. Scroll to the bottom here, for APR and exceptions. The smart person signs up during a big purchase: When you sign up and get approved, you get 20% off an in-store purchase (up to $100 off).\n\nAnother way to get 5% off on items you need regularly is to set up a Lowe’s subscription. This is good for items ranging from cleaning products, air and water filters, lawn care, pet goods, plumbing, and batteries. Shipping is free, and delivery happens automatically."

            "content": "Iowa lawmakers voted to advance state House bill 751 last week, legislation that would ensure farmers in the state can freely repair their own agricultural equipment, like tractors. This Tuesday, the bill was renamed to House File 2709, and it will be voted on again. Should the political winds align, it will go through the Iowa House and Senate before the Iowa Legislature adjourns on April 21.\n\nThe bill is the first of nearly 57 state bills supported by repair advocates across the country in 2026. Many of them focus on farm equipment in states like Oklahoma, Wyoming, Delaware, and West Virginia. Repair advocates hope a win in Iowa—the second-highest-grossing state in the US for agricultural products, behind California—will help further legislative and broader efforts to make phones, cars, and other devices more repairable.\n\n“This isn't just a blue state thing; this isn't just a Colorado activist thing,” says Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability for the right-to-repair advocate arm of iFixit. “Its real. Farmers have trouble repairing their equipment and want change.”\n\nFarmers and their tractors have long been a focal point of the right-to-repair movement, the ever-growing global effort to let product owners fix their own devices and equipment without manufacturer approval. Farmers who use tractors to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops often need to repair their equipment while they work. Waiting for manufacturer approval to get something fixed, or taking the time to bring the equipment to an approved dealership, can cause delays, frustration, and missed opportunities to harvest crops.\n\nThe Iowa bill defines which agricultural equipment it covers, including tractors, trailers, combines, sprayers, balers, and other equipment used to cultivate and harvest crops. It excludes aircraft and irrigation equipment, along with jet skis and snowmobiles.\n\nManufacturers would also be required to provide owners with data—documentation, like manuals, and access to embedded operating software—on their tractors, including future patches and fixes, all without charging for it or requiring authorization for internet access. The bill also limits the use of digital locks—software restrictions that prevent accessing features without manufacturer approval.\n\nOh Deere\n\nThe most prominent opposition to the Iowa bill is tractor manufacturer John Deere, which has a long history of opposing repair efforts and frustrating farmers who want to take more control of their equipment. The company is still fighting a lawsuit the US Federal Trade Commission levied against John Deere in January 2025 for “unlawful” repairability policies. The company has lobbied against the Iowa bill and outright opposes its passing.\n\n“John Deere is steadfast in supporting farmers' ability to repair their equipment,” wrote a John Deere representative in a statement responding to WIRED’s inquiry. “And we back that up by offering industry-leading self-repair tools and resources to both equipment owners and alternative service providers.”"

Both Amazon and Best Buy have the hazel color marked down from $229 to $180, a $49 discount on Google's most upgraded wireless earbuds.\n\nThe first change you'll notice from the previous generation Pixel Buds Pro is that the newer model is much lighter, and the buds are 27 percent smaller. As a result, these are an excellent choice for anyone with small ears, and they stay put super well. Reviewer Parker Hall “had no problem doing hours of tree pruning and going on long sweaty runs in Portland's early fall heat wave.”\n\nWith some help from top-notch physical sound isolation, the active noise-canceling on these is just as good as Apple’s and even goes toe-to-toe with big hitters like Bose and Sony. The transparency mode works just as well, too, with a wider range and clearer audio than a lot of other headphones offer. When it's time to actually turn up the tunes, you can enjoy a wide, natural soundstage that has excellent detail in the midrange and clear, sparkling treble.\n\nThe Gemini integration, unfortunately, leaves a bit to be desired. It's not the smoothest experience, particularly when asking multiple questions, and the Pixel Buds Pro 2 aren't offering anything that other earbuds can't do. Apple's live translations and heart rate monitors are more useful features, but if you're on Android, you're locked out of them anyway.\n\nIf you're interested in upgrading your earbud game, and you already have a Pixel, you can grab the Pixel Buds Pro 2 in hazel for $180 from either Amazon or Best Buy. If that color doesn't suit you, I also spotted lesser discounts on the peony color for $189, or the porcelain color for $210. For anyone who isn't already sold on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, make sure to swing by our guide to the best wireless earbuds, with picks for both Apple and Android owners."

It combines the abilities of Google’s previous release, Nano Banana Pro—like text rendering and web searching—with speedier image generation. This tool will be the new default in Google’s Gemini chatbot.\n\nThe first image model from Google under the Nano Banana moniker dropped last August, and the Pro version arrived three months later. The AI tool was widely adopted online to alter photos of real people, from generating custom action figures to nostalgic images of people hugging younger versions of themselves.\n\nNano Banana 2 is not only faster at crafting images, it’s also a more powerful photo editor. Despite some rough edges and unconvincing generations in my initial hands-on experience through Gemini, Google’s latest release marks the continued improvement of photorealistic AI tools that can manipulate existing images and serves as a stark reminder to always scrutinize unverified images you see online.\n\nGetting Started\n\nIf you want to try the new image model, the easiest way to access Nano Banana 2 is through the Gemini app or website. You can either click the banana emoji to generate images or just put the request in your prompts to the chatbot. This new image model is also available through Google’s Search tools, AI Studio, Cloud, and other services.\n\nGoogle says the Nano Banana 2 image generator pulls real-time information from the web, which can be useful for generating infographics. To test this, I asked Gemini to generate a custom weather report for my upcoming weekend getaway. Here’s my prompt:\n\nI'm going skiing in Dodge Ridge this weekend with some friends. Could you create an infographic that covers the weather conditions?"

It is Season 50, so we have Survivor players of eons past that are coming back to compete for the million dollars. I am so excited. It's going to be incredible. Zoë, my goal in the next few months is just to make you watch one, one, of the episodes. This is very important to me.\n\nBrian Barrett: If you were to make Zoë watch a historical episode of Survivor in isolation, what one hour of Survivor would you show her?\n\nLeah Feiger: Can I say a season, or does it have to be an episode?\n\nBrian Barrett: I want to go with that, because I don't think you're going to get her for a whole season.\n\nLeah Feiger: So I'm going to do the second-to-last episode of the Micronesia season of Survivor. Absolutely incredible season, known for the Black Widow Brigade. Zoë, I actually think you would really like it. Well, anyway, that is my WIRED. My TIRED—and I'm kind of devastated to say this—is Love Is Blind, which is ... I know that my theme was reality shows this week. Look, I have a lot of I wouldn't say love for Love Is Blind, but I have a lot of interest in Love Is Blind. I am an avid Love Is Blind watcher. I think it is a super interesting concept and a very weird show and produces a lot of very weird people. But there is a excellent WIRED article coming out about how MAGA it's gotten, and that those are the people that are going on the show right now, and the conversations that are happening between these couples who met behind a wall and are off to get married several weeks after knowing each other, the conversations are quite sad. They're making me sad. There's a lot of body shaming and it's just very—it's weird. So this season, it's not doing it for me, which that's OK, because Survivor is here to lift me out of the doldrums. That is my WIRED and TIRED. I stand by it. I swear that I read books and stuff too. I do not want this to be my only brand on this show.\n\nZoë Schiffer: Certainly not. Brian, drag us out. I need to get on firmer ground.\n\nBrian Barrett: OK. Well, I'm going to go TIRED. Samsung just announced some new phones. Those aren't TIRED, but TIRED is AI overload in phones. There's too much. So at this point, the new Samsung Galaxy S26 smartphones—similar to Google's conversational photo editor—they have a photo assist thing that lets you use natural language, so you can just type in. If you have a photo that you took, you can say like, \"Hey, give my dog a party hat,\" and then there will be a party hat on the dog. What's the point of taking photos anymore? Why not just prompt something instead from scratch, or just go touch some grass? I am curious about—they've got agents built into the phone, so you can use the phone. You can just say, \"Hey, order me a pizza,\" and the phone will just do that for you. We'll see if it works. I don't know. It seems like it might go off the rails. Anyway, too much too soon for me. That's my TIRED. I didn't plan a WIRED. I was so caught up on the phone, but because it came up earlier, I'll say the new Muppet Show episode with Sabrina Carpenter is really quite good, and I hope that it got a good enough response that Disney makes more of them."

Whether you want a personalized morning news digest, a proxy that can fight with your cable company's customer service, or a to-do list auditor that will do some tasks for you and prod you to resolve the rest, agentic assistants are built to access your digital accounts and carry out your commands. This is helpful—but has also caused a lot of chaos. The bots are out there mass-deleting emails they've been instructed to preserve, writing hit pieces over perceived snubs, and launching phishing attacks against their owners.\n\nWatching the pandemonium unfold in recent weeks, longtime security engineer and researcher Niels Provos decided to try something new. Today he is launching an open source, secure AI assistant called IronCurtain designed to add a critical layer of control. Instead of the agent directly interacting with the user's systems and accounts, it runs in an isolated virtual machine. And its ability to take any action is mediated by a policy—you could even think of it as a constitution—that the owner writes to govern the system. Crucially, IronCurtain is also designed to receive these overarching policies in plain English and then runs them through a multistep process that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert the natural language into an enforceable security policy.\n\n“Services like OpenClaw are at peak hype right now, but my hope is that there’s an opportunity to say, ‘Well, this is probably not how we want to do it,’” Provos says. “Instead, let’s develop something that still gives you very high utility, but is not going to go into these completely uncharted, sometimes destructive, paths.”\n\nIronCurtain's ability to take intuitive, straightforward statements and turn them into enforceable, deterministic—or predictable—red lines is vital, Provos says, because LLMs are famously “stochastic” and probabilistic. In other words, they don't necessarily always generate the same content or give the same information in response to the same prompt. This creates challenges for AI guardrails, because AI systems can evolve over time such that they revise how they interpret a control or constraint mechanism, which can result in rogue activity.\n\nAn IronCurtain policy, Provos says, could be as simple as: “The agent may read all my email. It may send email to people in my contacts without asking. For anyone else, ask me first. Never delete anything permanently.”\n\nIronCurtain takes these instructions, turns them into an enforceable policy, and then mediates between the assistant agent in the virtual machine and what's known as the model context protocol server that gives LLMs access to data and other digital services to carry out tasks. Being able to constrain an agent this way adds an important component of access control that web platforms like email providers don't currently offer because they weren't built for the scenario where both a human owner and AI agent bots are all using one account."

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers."

            "content": "If you drive a car that's newer than 2008, a new study finds your vehicle's tire pressure monitoring system can be used to track you.\n\nA group of researchers at IMDEA Networks Institute -- an English-speaking research organization on data networks based in Madrid -- discovered this privacy risk at the end of a 10-week study in which they collected roughly 6 million wireless signals from over 20,000 cars. Their findings point to a serious hacker threat hiding in the tire sensors of most modern vehicles.\n\nThe TREAD Act of 2000 mandated that modern cars come equipped with TPMS for road safety. The system works by releasing wireless signals through tiny sensors attached to each tire, which communicate each tire's pressure information to the car's electronic control unit. A warning light on the vehicle's dashboard indicates low tire pressure.\n\nInstead of using a camera with a clear line of sight to the car, hackers can hypothetically track it using the wireless signals emitted by the car's tire sensors. That signal is continuously sent out as an unencrypted unique ID number.\n\nBasically, anyone nearby with a cheap radio receiver can pick up the signal and later recognize the same vehicle without ever seeing the license plate.\n\nInformation could help users track drivers\n\n\"Our results show that these tire sensor signals can be used to follow vehicles and learn their movement patterns,\" Domenico Giustiniano, research professor at IMDEA Networks Institute, said in the peer-reviewed report. \"This means a network of inexpensive wireless receivers could quietly monitor the patterns of cars in real-world environments. Such information could reveal daily routines, such as work arrival times or travel habits.\"\n\nThe researchers were able to capture signals from more than 50 meters away from moving cars, through walls and from inside buildings. The tire pressure readings helped reveal the vehicle type, its weight and the driving pattern of the driver. It's a cheap, tough-to-detect, potentially covert tracking method.\n\nWhile this may be a startling discovery, Cooper Quintin, a senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told CNET it's not the only privacy threat in your car's computer system.\n\n\"Any method that can be misused to surreptitiously track people's movements without their knowledge is concerning,\" he said. \"But so are all of the technologies in modern cars that intentionally violate drivers' privacy by collecting and sharing data for purposes of advertising, insurance risk assessment, and more. It's sad that drivers have to worry about this, and everyone should learn how to protect themselves whenever possible while manufacturers are pressured to do better.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time a group of researchers has raised the red flag about this sensor system in cars. A 2010 study by researchers at Rutgers University and the University of South Carolina warned of the potential privacy threat hiding in a vehicle's tire pressure system. Sixteen years later, the flaw persists.\n\n\"TPMS was designed for safety, not security,\" said Dr. Yago Lizarribar, one of the study's authors. \"Our findings show the need for manufacturers and regulators to improve protection in future vehicle sensor systems.\"\n\nThe study urges policymakers and car manufacturers to design a more secure and privacy-preserving TPMS for future cars."

Whereas the company just in November had estimated a drop of between 0.9% and 5.2% (the latter being its \"pessimistic scenario\"), now it sees a 12.9% decline this year, based on its Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is not a temporary squeeze, but a tsunami-like shock originating in the memory supply chain, with ripple effects spreading across the entire consumer electronics industry,\" Francisco Jeronimo, vice president for Worldwide Client Devices at IDC, said in a statement.\n\nThe hardest-hit companies are expected to be those selling to the lower end of the market, which can't absorb the higher component costs while maintaining profitable margins. As a result, Jeronimo says, many of those players will pass the added costs on to consumers.\n\nThat also includes regional markets like the Middle East and Africa that sell mostly inexpensive smartphones, which could see a steep 20.6% drop year-over-year.\n\nIDC predicts a steep drop in smartphone sales for 2026. IDC\n\nBy contrast, IDC expects Apple and Samsung to be better able to withstand the crisis. \"As smaller and low-end-positioned Android vendors struggle with rising costs, Apple and Samsung could not only weather the storm but potentially expand market share as the competitive landscape tightens,\" said Jeronimo.\n\nMemory has become scarce due to the insatiable demand to feed generative AI. Essentially all of the memory set to be manufactured this year is already earmarked. What started as a demand for graphics processors has expanded to other components. For example, hard drive manufacturer Western Digital announced in early February that it had already sold out of its supply for 2026.\n\n\"We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points,\" said Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, projecting a 14% rise in the average selling price of smartphones to $523.\n\nPopal expects memory prices to stabilize by the middle of 2027, but doesn't see them coming down to earlier levels. The sub-$100 segment, made up of approximately 171 million devices, will be \"permanently uneconomical,\" she said. \"In short, there is no return to business as usual for vendors and consumers.\""

Unlike chatbots, which stay within their own boundaries to produce text, images or code, AI agents can take specific actions -- for instance, plan and book a vacation -- without a person constantly giving it commands.\n\nIn a live event just hours before Nvidia released its earnings, Samsung unveiled its new Galaxy S26 lineup of phones, devoting a good deal of time to talking about the \"agentic AI experience\" they'll deliver.\n\nDuring Nvidia's call, Huang said that the world has \"awakened to the agentic inflection\" and that it only happened within the last two or three months. He also said he believes the next inflection will be physical AI, a term that describes the embedding of artificial intelligence in machinery, including self-driving cars and robots.\n\nRobots were a notable presence at CES earlier this year, the consumer electronics extravaganza. Companies showed them off doing everything from folding clothes to serving as companions to handling assembly line work.\n\nWe should hear much more about what to expect from Nvidia at its GTC conference in March. It will likely have more to say about its AI-focused Rubin chip, and may also be ready to take the plunge into laptop chip territory."

The streaming giant said it \"had declined to raise its offer\" after Paramount submitted a revised all-cash bid of $31 per share on Tuesday to buy WBD in its entirety. WBD had reviewed the rival offer and announced that its board of directors found it \"superior\" to the Netflix agreement.\n\nNetflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in a statement: \"At the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive.\"\n\nThe statement went on to say: \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US.\"\n\nHowever, according to Netflix, the transaction was more of a \"nice to have\" than a \"must have\" at any price.\n\nIf approved, Paramount's new bid would see it not only pay $31 per share in cash, but also be on the hook for a $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe Netflix for backing out of its agreement. Additionally, Paramount would also be responsible for paying \"a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after Sept. 30, 2026,\" according to WBD, and pony up $7 billion should the deal not pass regulatory requirements.\n\nParamount's deal is backed by cash from Larry Ellison, the billionaire father of Paramount CEO David Ellison.\n\nThe merger-acquisition plan between Netflix and WBD was originally announced on Dec. 5 for $83 billion (stocks and cash). The deal has since seen several takeover bids from Paramount, prompting Netflix to switch to an all-cash deal in January while Paramount engaged in a back-and-forth to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe announcement arrives on the day of WBD's Q4 earnings call, and the same day that Netflix's Sarandos visited Washington, DC, to meet with officials amid the Paramount bid.\n\nCNET's Corinne Reichert also contributed to this report."

It applies to parents using the platform's optional parental supervision setting, which requires consent from both teens and their parents to participate. Parental supervision allows parents to see the accounts their teen follows, set a time limit for how long their teen can use the app and more.\n\nIf teens repeatedly make suicide-related searches, parents will receive alerts via in-app notifications and email, text or WhatsApp, depending on available contact information. In addition to informing parents of their teen's searches, notifications will allow them to \"view expert resources designed to help them approach potentially sensitive conversations with their teen,\" according to Meta.\n\nAn example of the alerts.

The company said its policy is to block searches for self-harm and suicide content and direct people to resources and helplines.\n\nThis move by Instagram is just one of many digital safety measures aimed at protecting young people online. It comes as governments push their own guardrails: Australia recently enacted the world's first ban on social media accounts for children under 16, and the United Kingdom is considering similar restrictions.

The S26 Ultra continues the company's tradition of Ultra handsets that offer top-of-the-line features that are lacking from the rest of their respective series. And this year, the Ultra's Privacy Display is the clear highlight feature, allowing you to customize how visible your phone is to others around you.\n\nAside from that, the S26 Ultra's other improvements are somewhat marginal. Yes, it's now made out of aluminum, the screen is a touch bigger, a 16GB RAM option is available, the processor is improved and the charging speeds are faster, but the rest of the S26 Ultra's features are similar to that of the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Even the price remains the same at $1,300.\n\nHere is how the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra compares with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nWatch this: First Look at the Galaxy S26 Ultra: Camera, Battery and AI Updates 02:56\n\nDesign and display\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra only has a marginally larger screen compared to the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra. Both the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra have 6.8-inch AMOLED screens with 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution, while the new S26 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED display also with a 3,120 by 1,440 pixel resolution. All three screens have a 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate.\n\nBut it's the pixel-level Privacy Display that's particularly impressive with the S26 Ultra. When activated, the display will remain visible when looking directly at the phone while making it difficult to impossible to see what's on screen from the side. In addition to letting you turn the feature on and off for different apps, you can even have the Privacy Display activate exclusively for notifications while keeping the rest of the screen plainly visible.\n\nThe S26 Ultra's screen uses Gorilla Glass Armor 2 cover glass, while the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra both use Gorilla Glass Armor. Gorilla Glass Armor 2 is said to be more scratch and drop resistant compared to its earlier version.\n\nSize-wise, the S26 Ultra is a touch bigger but also a touch thinner compared to its predecessors. CNET Senior Reporter Abrar Al-Heeti describes the new design as feeling thinner and lighter than prior Ultra phones during her hands-on time. It measures 6.44 by 3.07 by 0.31 inches, while the S25 Ultra's dimensions are 6.41 by 3.06 by 0.32 inches and the S24 Ultra measures 6.4 by 3.11 by 0.34 inches. Also, the S26 Ultra has an aluminum frame. That's a departure from the titanium frame found on both the S25 Ultra and the S24 Ultra.\n\nThe cameras on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Celso Bulgatti/CNET\n\nCameras\n\nWhile the S26 Ultra certainly has the best camera hardware of the S26 lineup, it has the same exact camera specs as its predecessors. All three Ultra phones have four cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 50-megapixel ultrawide, a 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto. That said, the S26 Ultra does have larger apertures and to capture better low-light photos. They also all have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera.\n\nMany of the S26 Ultra's camera upgrades come from software. There's the Horizontal Lock feature that'll keep the horizon steady while shooting video, selfies can now capture more natural skin tones and screenshots will now be sorted into its own categories within the Gallery.\n\nThe Galaxy S26 Ultra next to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Vanessa Hand Orellana/CNET\n\nBattery, processor and RAM\n\nAll three Ultra phones have a 5,000 mAh battery, but the charging speeds differ. The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra have 45W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, while the new S26 Ultra has 60W of wired charging and 25W wireless charging. Just like the S25 Ultra, the S26 Ultra does not include magnets but can support magnetic charging accessories when using a case that includes them.\n\nThe processors in the Ultra phones also get progressively faster and more efficient with each generation. The S24 Ultra has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the S25 Ultra uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy and the S26 Ultra ships with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy.\n\nWhile all three Ultra handsets come in three storage capacity options -- 256GB, 512GB and 1TB -- the S26 Ultra is the only one with a 16GB RAM option. (This ships with the 512GB and 1TB options.) The S24 Ultra and S25 Ultra only ship with 12GB of RAM.\n\nCheck out the below chart to compare more details between the S26 Ultra, S25 Ultra and S24 Ultra."
