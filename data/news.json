Their European Club Finance and Investment Landscape assessment has also highlighted the financial dominance of the Premier League in comparison to other major divisions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThat was particularly evidenced by the increase in television revenue to £1.3bn (€1.5b) for English clubs. That staggering figure very nearly amounted to the £1.4bn (€1.6bn) that 53 other European top-division leagues received combined.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDespite taking a share of that major financial boost, United's specific failures have also been exposed by UEFA, with £692million emerging as their net spend on transfers between 2021 and 2025. Significant losses on the likes of Antony and Paul Pogba have undoubtedly impacted that, even with other Premier League clubs spending more.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMan Utd and Premier League clubs sent warning by UEFA after financial results revealed READ MORE :\n\nMan Utd taking Kobbie Mainoo transfer risk as latest contract stance emerges READ MORE :\n\nThe likes of Chelsea and Arsenal have parted ways with substantial transfer fees over the five-year period, accounting for £656m and £587m, respectively, as their net spends. England's financial dominance has also been demonstrated on the pitch with six teams in the last-16 of this season's Champions League.\n\nFor UEFA to publish their findings, an examination of financial accounts from 2021 to 2025 was conducted. This meant the impact of all transfer activity across the five years was included, encompassing profits on sale, amortisation from earlier transfers and impairments.\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn the report, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said: \"After a decade that included one of the toughest periods our sport and our society have faced, European football has come through in a strong position. Club revenues have grown steadily across the board, and top-division income is expected to pass €30bn in the 2025 financial year.\"\n\nThere have been some financial bright spots for United lately, though, with their most recent accounts revealing an operating profit of £32.6million recorded for the opening six months of the fiscal year.\n\nCompared to the £3.9m loss reported during the equivalent period in the previous year, that represents quite the uplift with those improvements fuelled by strategic cost-management measures authorised by Sir Jim Ratcliffe.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt appeared to be a difficult financial period for United without the inclusion of European football and the substantial funding that accompanies it, but evidently, that has not been the case.\n\nThere has, however, been a predictable decline in commercial and matchday revenue due to fewer fixtures, with the club just over £9million down.\n\nView 2 Images Manchester United CEO Omar Berrada issued an update after the release of the club's latest accounts (Image: Getty Images)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnited CEO Omar Berrada stated: \"We are now seeing the positive financial impact of our off-pitch transformation materialise both in our costs and profitability. We continue to take a football first approach and invest in both our men's and women's first teams.\n\n\"On the pitch our men's team sits fourth in the Premier League and our women's team are second in the Women's Super League, as well as reaching the League Cup final and the quarter-final of the UEFA Women's Champions League.\n\n\"Today's results demonstrate the underlying strength of our business as we continue to push for the best football results possible for our men's and women's teams.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. **Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings"

He has also devoted the past 13 years of his career to playing European football since departing Sao Paulo in January 2013, initially on loan, for Madrid.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeculation regarding a switch to Italy comes after former United striker Dion Dublin's appeal for Casemiro to remain.

Carrick has made an impressive start to his second stint in the Old Trafford hot seat.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nStepping in as Ruben Amorim's interim successor until the season's close, the ex-midfielder has returned to the dugout and already steered United into a favourable position in the battle for Champions League qualification. The Reds have remained undefeated under Carrick, securing five wins from their six matches, including notable triumphs over Manchester City, Arsenal, and Tottenham.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCurrently occupying fourth place, they are merely three points adrift of third-placed Aston Villa. Despite widespread knowledge that United's board plan to appoint a new permanent manager in the summer, there is increasing demand for Carrick to be awarded the role full-time.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nDublin, speaking to OLBG, has suggested that making Carrick the permanent manager might not be such a poor decision after all. He said: \"I think you have to leave it as it is because if it's working, then don't mess with it. You know, don't tinker with it.\n\n\"The players seem to be on board with Michael.

The dressing room seems to believe that what they're doing is the right thing. I suppose the question is, can he keep it going? Well, what manager can do that? What manager can consistently win and win and win? I just think you leave it as it is.\"\n\n\"United at this present time and it hasn't been for years, is stable. It's stable, it's strong. And when you watch Man United now, and I've been in the stands a few times at some of Michael's matches, it's like watching Man United, which is very odd. It hasn't been like that for a long time.\"\n\nThe ex-Aston Villa striker Dublin admitted that United will undoubtedly consider big-name contenders like Zinedine Zidane, yet he remains convinced Carrick has demonstrated he possesses the credentials to succeed at the Theatre of Dreams.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Dublin believes Carrick can bring Man United back to their best (Image: PA)\n\n\"But the biggest and the best allegedly have had a go,\" Dublin continued. \"Have had a go before, Michael, and it just hasn't worked, you know.\n\n\"The best up and coming, the best coaches, the best football, the best results in Portugal, the best results in Germany, whatever it may be, they're all getting the best results, but who's done what Michael's done?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

The 58-year-old left the Reds in 2024 after nearly nine years in charge.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nKlopp remains an immensely popular figure among Liverpool supporters, having led the club to Premier League and Champions League silverware. The German manager pointed to exhaustion as his motivation for leaving the club, with successor Arne Slot leading Liverpool to their second league title in the Premier League era in his first season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn January 2025, Klopp began a brand new role as head of global soccer for Red Bull, with several clubs under his watch. Recent claims in Austria suggested Red Bull wouldn't block Klopp if he opted to resume management duties, though these suggestions have subsequently been refuted.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWhile Klopp has been associated with various positions since departing Anfield, he has indicated he's in no hurry to make any changes from his current post and return to the dugout.

We won a lot of games so there was often a very good mood in the building. I still have Virgil [van Dijk's] laugh in my ear for example.\"\n\nRumours in Austria pointed to Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner being earmarked as a potential successor to Klopp at Red Bull. However, CEO Oliver Mintzlaff has rubbished suggestions the company is dissatisfied with the work the Liverpool legend has delivered so far.\n\n\"This is complete nonsense and completely plucked out of thin air,\" Mintzlaff stated. \"On the contrary, we are extremely satisfied with the work Jurgen Klopp is doing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\n\"He invests a great deal of time and effort, he is in constant communication with our coaches and sporting directors, and continues to develop our Red Bull football philosophy in a sustainable way.

The German also reaffirmed his intentions to remain away from the dugout last month.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"I don't expect to change my mind, but I don't know. We're building a house right now and my missus wanted to have a really big trophy room,\" Klopp said.\n\n\"There was another small room and I said, 'This is enough, because we know how many trophies we have, we will not add any.' It might sound arrogant, but I know I can coach a football team. But I don't need to do it until my last day.\"\n\nFOLLOW OUR LIVERPOOL FB PAGE!

And it is likely to signal a revolution in the multi-billion pound business of TV rights and could change the way every armchair viewer watches the English top flight.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters revealed they are starting the new project by launching a new direct-to-viewer streaming service with broadcaster StarHub in Singapore. That will act as a pilot for the Premier League + channel and it will show all 380 games live as well as magazine content starting next season.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere is currently a 3pm blackout in the UK but foreign deals would be exempt from rules showing games live on a Saturday. Prem insiders insist there are no immediate plans to scrap the blackout in the UK despite a growing belief in the industry that it could be ditched after the next TV deal in 2029.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nPrem bosses are hoping Premier League + will be a big success in the Far East and that could then pave the way for the 20 clubs to sell their TV rights directly to the viewers.\n\nMasters, talking at the FT Live Business of Football Summit, said: “For the first time, we’re going direct-to-consumer in Singapore. It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen. We have a six-year agreement with StarHub, one of the two providers out there. So from next season onwards, Premier League + – rather than Premflix – finally, it’s going to happen.\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

It’s going to have to deal with promotion, pricing, churn, distribution, all of those things. We’re looking to build a business. We’re also looking to learn, to see how that might be replicable around the world.\n\n“We’ve now taken control of our content. It allows us to look differently in the future, and it may become a business centre in its own right, but I think it does make all of those different options we have in front of us more easy to execute.”\n\nEnglish football’s top flight has become the richest and most powerful in the world thanks to its market-leading TV contracts and it currently has a mega £6.7billion domestic deal with Sky and TNT Sports. But that could soon change with the Premier League looking to take charge of its own rights. There have been major hints about selling games directly to viewers in the past - but this is the first time they have confirmed it officially.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE!

The referee responded by crossing ​his arms in front of his ⁠face, activating FIFA's anti-racism protocol and temporarily stopping the match.\n\nUEFA has opened an investigation into allegations of \"discriminatory behaviour\" after the game in Lisbon, and Prestianni was handed a one-match suspension, covering the second leg at the Bernabeu.\n\nBenfica appealed the temporary suspension, and Prestianni did travel and train with the squad in Madrid. However, the appeal was dismissed hours before the game on Wednesday.\n\nReal Madrid won the tie 3-1 on aggregate to seal a spot on the last 16. Aurelien Tchouameni said the result was a \"victory for everyone who stands against racism\".\n\nImage: Gianluca Prestianni arrives in Madrid with the Benfica squad (credit Benfica)\n\nMourinho criticised for response over incident\n\nBenfica manager Jose Mourinho did not speak to the media around Wednesday's second leg, with his sending off during the first leg meaning he did not have to carry out his usual media duties.\n\nIt comes after the former Real Madrid boss was widely criticised for appearing to defend Prestianni and the club by questioning the way Vinicius Jr celebrates goals.\n\n\"I told him, when you score a goal like that you just celebrate and walk back. They [Vinicius Jr and Prestianni] told me different things. But I don't believe in one or another. I want to be an independent,\" Mourinho told Amazon Prime following the first leg.\n\n\"When he was arguing about racism, I told him the biggest person [Eusebio] in the history of this club was black. This club, the last thing that it is, is racist.\"\n\nImage: Mourinho spoke to Vinicius Jr after the incident in the Champions League knockout round play-off first leg\n\nMourinho then appeared to comment on previous incidents in which Vinicius Jr has been subject to racist abuse in stadiums.\n\nThe Brazilian has spoken out multiple times against racism he has been subject to inside stadiums. In June 2024, three Valencia fans were jailed for eight months for racially abusing him during a LaLiga game the previous year, in the first verdict of its kind in Spain.\n\n\"There is something wrong because it happens in every stadium,\" said Mourinho. \"A stadium where Vinicius plays something happens, always.\"\n\nMourinho was seen speaking to a visibly upset Vinicius Jr and a member of the Benfica coaching staff was shown a red card during the lengthy stoppage. After a number of discussions between players, coaches and the referee, play then resumed.\n\nReal Madrid held on to win but there was a further short delay late in stoppage time when fans threw objects as Vinicius Jr was attempting to take a corner kick.\n\nImage: Vinicius Junior scored against Benfica in the second leg to round off Real Madrid's win\n\n'Prestianni facing 10-game ban'\n\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol:\n\nUEFA has moved very quickly to suspend Prestianni. They appointed an ethics inspector last Wednesday to look into allegations that Prestianni had racially abused Vinicius Jr the previous evening.\n\nThe inspector has already spoken to the relevant parties and forwarded an interim report to UEFA's disciplinary body, recommending Prestianni is suspended for one game while the disciplinary process continues.\n\nThe inspector believes there is prima facie evidence that Prestianni has broken UEFA's regulations on discriminatory behaviour, which carries a minimum 10-game ban.\n\nUEFA says the provisional ban is without prejudice, which means Prestianni can still expect a fair hearing.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Aurélien Tchouaméni praised Vinícius Júnior for his performance against Benfica, after the forward was allegedly subjected to racial abuse during the first leg of their Champions League play-off clash.\n\nVinicius Jr: Racists are cowards\n\nPosting after the first leg, in Portuguese on his Instagram story, Vinicius Jr wrote: \"Racists are, above all, cowards.\n\n\"They need to put their shirts over their mouths to demonstrate how weak they are.\n\n\"But they have, on their side, the protection of others who, theoretically, have the obligation to punish. Nothing that happened here today was new in my life and my family's.\n\n\"I received a yellow card for celebrating a goal. I still don't understand why. On the other hand, just a poorly executed protocol that served no purpose.\n\n\"I don't like appearing in situations like this, even more so after a great victory and when the headlines have to be about Real Madrid, but it's necessary.\"\n\nImage: Vinicius Jr spoke to referee Francois Letexier after Benfica's Gianluca Prestianni appeared to make a comment towards him\n\nIn a statement in Portuguese on Instagram, shared by Benfica on social media, Prestianni denied making racist comments.\n\nHe wrote: \"I want to clarify that at no time did I direct racist insults to Vini Jr, who regrettably misunderstood what he thought he heard.\n\n\"I was never racist with anyone and I regret the threats I received from Real Madrid players.\"\n\nBenfica posted footage of the incident on X, with the comment: \"As the images demonstrate, given the distance, the Real Madrid players could not have heard what they claim to have heard.\"\n\nMbappe explains what he heard\n\nReal Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe said in an interview after the match in Lisbon that he heard Prestianni racially abuse his team-mate and said the Benfica winger should not be allowed to play in the Champions League.\n\n\"I know everything,\" the France international said after the game. \"I will explain everything that happened.\n\n\"Vinicius scored a goal - an amazing goal. He goes to dance and the people boo him. That's something that happens in football. After that, there's a moment of tension with the Benfica players. It's better if it doesn't happen, but this can happen too.\n\n\"It's the Champions League, the best competition in the world for clubs. So, it's normal that people want to win, to give their best for their club and their fans and defend their colours.\n\n\"After that, Benfica's No 25 - I don't want to say his name because he doesn't deserve it - starts to talk badly. You don't accept it but, again, it happens in football and it will continue to happen.\n\n\"He put his shirt here [over his mouth] to say Vinicius is a ****** five times. I heard it. There are Benfica players who heard it as well. And after that point, everything you have seen started.\n\n\"I want to try and explain it calmly. I don't want to speak in a general manner. I have come to Portugal many times. I have been lucky to have many team-mates and friends from Portugal, and nothing has ever happened to me.\n\n\"With these kind of things, it's very important to speak in a very clear way, and to not speak in general, because there are people who haven't done anything wrong. In the stadium, I think there are 70,000 people who haven't done anything wrong. They just wanted to support their team.\n\n\"I have the maximum respect for Benfica and their manager, who is one of the best in history, who has made history at Real Madrid.\n\n\"But this player, for me, doesn't deserve to play in the Champions League anymore.\n\n\"It's a wonderful thing to play in the Champions League. The best competition. Everyone here, all the journalists, loves the Champions League, no? It inspires me as a player, it inspires the people, it inspires children, and we have to give the best possible example to young people.\n\n\"If we let this kind of thing happen, I think all the values of football are worthless, all that we believe is worthless. We have to do something.\"\n\nVinicius Jr's history with incidents of racism\n\nVinicius Jr has spoken out previously about repeated racist abuse he has suffered, saying in 2024 that he felt \"less and less\" like playing football because of the abuse.\n\nIn that same year, three Valencia fans were sentenced to eight months in prison for racially abusing him at a match in May 2023 - in scenes reminiscent of those in Benfica, as the game was also stopped for 10 minutes after Vinicius Jr alerted the referee to fans he felt had abused him.\n\nAfter the game, the Brazilian said LaLiga \"belongs to racism\". But LaLiga president Javier Tebas responded that Vinicius Jr had been \"manipulated\" in calling out the abuse. Tebas later apologised for those comments.\n\nThe three supporters from the Valencia incident were also fined €5,000 (£4,681) and banned from sporting venues for one year for making racist gestures. Valencia were fined €27,000 (£23,581) and had their stadium partially closed for three matches.\n\nSince then, Spain has been punishing supporters for racist abuse towards Vinicius Jr. Four people were convicted for hanging an effigy with his name on it off a highway bridge in Madrid earlier in 2023.\n\nThree of them were sentenced to seven months in prison for hate crimes and threats, while the other was sentenced to 15 months in prison for sharing the images online.\n\nAll four had to take an anti-discrimination training programme to have those sentences suspended, while they were also fined €60,000 and banned from sports venues for two years.\n\nAnd just last year, five Real Valladolid fans were found guilty for racially abusing Vinicius Jr during a match in 2022. They faced one year in prison and were fined up to €1,620 (£1,412) - but again the prison sentences were suspended as long as they did not attend a football match for three years."

Signed for £72m as a promising striker filled with potential just two years earlier, he was pushed out of Old Trafford to make way for Sesko over the summer.\n\nImage: Sesko celebrates his winner in the 1-0 win at Everton\n\nSesko is beginning to show signs he can bear the burden of being United's No. 9 - but three of his five goals have come as a substitute and the other two against promoted-side Burnley, currently second from bottom.\n\nHow Sesko copes when he is the regular starter will be the true test of the 22-year-old.\n\n\"It's a lot of pressure,\" Neville said. \"The biggest pressure in English football, that's a Manchester United goalkeeper, but not far behind would be a striker who comes for big money to United.\n\n\"When you come in as a striker with a big price tag, you've got to deliver and he's starting to deliver.\n\n\"There is a danger that maybe that he's sort of getting that super-sub title, but I don't think he's that type. He's a starting player. He has been a super sub in the last few games because he's needed to be.\n\n\"I don't think he's ever going to be the perfect striker, like I said about Gyokeres. But if he can be a handful, contribute with goals, hold things up, link play, that'll be enough. You don't have to be always perfect and [his winner at Everton], it's a big moment for him.\n\n\"If he can get another four or five and finish this season in double figures, in his first season with the struggle that the team were having at the beginning, I think that would be deemed to be a good season.\"\n\nManchester United\n\nCrystal Palace Sunday 1st March 12:30pm Kick off 2:00pm\n\nSesko faced questions about how he copes with the scrutiny of being United's goalscorer after his winner at Everton as the conversation soon turned to whether he would start at Palace.\n\n\"The pressure is something that, if I want to be a good player, it's something that I have to have,\" Sesko said.\n\n\"It's something that has (to be there) if you want to play at the highest level and it's about accepting it and not really caring about it.\"\n\nSesko has made a strong case to be in from the start against Palace. It is now up to Carrick to decide whether now is the right time to open the door for the young striker.\n\nWatch Man Utd vs Crystal Palace on Sunday, live on Sky Sports, kick-off 2pm"

Share\n\n2m ago 15.16 EST 14 min I’ve not seen much of Lucca, but he’s putting himself about. If I was Vitor pereira, I’d be telling my wingers and midfielders to stand balls up to the penalty spot and far post, because if he gets a run on, no one’s beating him in the air. Share\n\n4m ago 15.14 EST 12 min Lovely from Anderson, picking his way along the by-line and poking a ball across the face of the six-yard box that beseeches a tap=in, but no one gambles and it passes through the corridor and to relative safety. Share\n\n5m ago 15.13 EST 11 min Good straight ball into Lucca, who controls well and lays off for McAee, who swerves around his man nicely only to thread a pass in behind to no one. Share\n\n8m ago 15.11 EST 9 min Guendouzi moves forward and spreads the play, but Forest quickly win the ball back and Hutchinson attacks down the left, swinging an excellent low cross into the corridor, but ahead of the onrushing Lucca. Share\n\n9m ago 15.10 EST 8 min Eeeesh, he’s grimacing now, and off the pitch getting things sorted. I’m not sure he’ll get from 90 degrees to 180, but a respectable 150 will be enough for now. Share\n\n10m ago 15.08 EST 6 min The away end if proper bouncing, fans in red and yellow on the outsides and those in the middle dressed in black. Meantime, Yates challenges Oguz, pulling him back, and his finger has popped. Credit where it’s due, he takes it superbly, not even grimacing. Share\n\n13m ago 15.06 EST 4 min Forest knock it about nicely, giving it away as soon as they try to progress the ball get it forward. They look confident, though. Share\n\n15m ago 15.04 EST 2 min Rain is swirling in Nottingham, which we’re being shown rather than whatever’s going on in the away end.

Share\n\n21m ago 14.58 EST They’re playing Born Slippy at the City Ground, more than enough excuse for me to embed this: Does any other riff immediately transport you back to a time and place as intensely as this one? If so, I’d like to hear it. Share\n\n29m ago 14.50 EST “The game starts 0-0,” Vitor Pereira tells TNT, saying his team need to play with ambition and organisation, enjoying it and showing their quality. Today is an opportunity for the likes of Jair Cunha to show he’s got the quality and mentality necessary, but the games are like training – the players need to improve. Share\n\n31m ago 14.48 EST On the telly, they’ve just been discussing James McAtee, and I’m looking forward to seeing how he does tonight. City are now in that spot United were under Alex Ferguson, where clubs buy their players because they know the standard can be too high for good ones to make it and respect the managers who keep them around. He’s got a lovely touch and decent vision, but does he have the ability to impose that? We don’t yet know. Share\n\n37m ago 14.42 EST Forest actually did pretty well to keep as many players as they did after last season – and getting £52m+£3m for Anthony Elanga was a remarkable piece of business. I’m not sure Anderson will still be around after the summer, whereas Gibbs-White has a contract – but there surely comes a point at which players don’t trust Marinakis with their careers and just want to up sticks from the upheaval. Share\n\n42m ago 14.37 EST Bizarre goings-on in the Conference League – Fiorentina, 3-0 up on Jagiellonia Bialystock from the first leg, are now level at 3-3, Bartosz Mazurek having scored a hat-trick. Share\n\n45m ago 14.34 EST Back to Elliot Anderson, how good do we think he is? I like him a lot and have done since before he left Newcastle and perhaps I’m just being old here, but good though he is, when I put him then into historical context, I don’t see him as on the same planet as your Bryan Robsons, Roy Keanes, Patrick Vieiras, Paul Inces and Graeme Sounesseseseses of this world – same goes for Declan Rice. Share\n\n51m ago 14.28 EST Elsewhere, Celtic lead 1-0 in Stuttgart so trail 4-2 on aggregate. There are five minutes left – and don’t forget, it’s Ibrox on Sunday. Share\n\n54m ago 14.24 EST One Forest first-XIer who doesn’t drop top the bench is Elliot Anderson. On the one hand, I’m certain the manager would like to rest him for the league but, on the other, he can’t run the risk of letting this get close, never mind actually lose, and I guess Anderson and Murillo are the players he reckons he most needs to make sure that doesn’t happen. Share\n\n1h ago 14.21 EST Fener, meanwhile, are in the midst of an injury crisis – Ederson, Oosterwolde and the one and only Caglar Soyuncu are out so yes, that is indeed Matteo Guendouzi whose name you see at centre-back – no doubt he already considers himself better than Beckenbauer. Otherwise, Ngolo Kanté is in midfield, while Marco Asensio and Nelson Semedo are on the bench. Share\n\n1h ago 14.18 EST Unsurprisingly, Vitor Pereira makes changes – six of them. Out go Milenkovic, Aina, Sangaré, Hudson-Odoi, Gibbs-White and Igor Jesus; in come Morato, Jair Cunha, Dominguez, McAtee, Yates and Lucca Share\n\n1h ago 14.09 EST Teams Nottingham Forest (5-4-1): Ortega; Williams, Morato, Murillo, Jair Cunha, Hutchinson; McAtee, Anderson, Yates, Dominguez; Lucca.

            "content": "Chelsea made a financial loss of £355m in the 2024-25 season, according to new data released by Uefa, the biggest deficit ever recorded by an English football club.\n\nAccording to Uefa, Chelsea’s losses were about £186m higher than the second-worst losses in Europe, the £171m figure posted by Lyon. The figures are also about £260m worse than those posted by the Blues in 2023-24.\n\nWhile Uefa’s report does not fully break down Chelsea’s figures, it does show that while Chelsea have spent money on a level with the top clubs in Europe, costs have not been matched by revenues. Chelsea’s wage bill is estimated to be the sixth-highest in Europe, at £390m a season. Chelsea’s operational expenditure, or day-to-day costs, were the fifth highest in Europe, meanwhile, at £241m. Uefa also calculate that the Blues have the most expensive squad in history, assembled at a combined cost of over £1.5bn.\n\nIn terms of matchday revenue, however, Chelsea made a reported £1.2m less per game than Liverpool, with Stamford Bridge only the 10th biggest ground in last season’s Premier League. Commercial revenue fell year-on-year to £207m, about £165m less than the figure reported by Manchester City and at odds with an overall trend for growth in this area. Chelsea did, though, increase their broadcast revenues, from £167m to £193m thanks in large part to their success at the Club World Cup.\n\nChelsea’s finances have been the subject of debate since the club was taken over by investment vehicle BlueCo in 2021. The men’s team has largely gone without a front of shirt sponsor in the intervening years, while the club have also become known for tying their players to long-term contracts, such as the eight-year deal given to the winger Mykhailo Mudryk, reported to be worth £100,000-a-week in wages. The Ukrainian is serving a provisional suspension for doping.\n\nThe ownership have also sold hotels on the club’s grounds to related businesses in order to meet the Premier League’s profit and sustainability rules, a deal noted by Uefa in their report as being a significant contribution to the relative financial health of the league in 2023.\n\nAlso on the list of Europe’s biggest financial losers are the French side Strasbourg. Ranking at No 8 in Uefa’s list, with reported losses of £69m, the Ligue 1 side is also owned by BlueCo and has spent increasingly substantial figures on transfer fees in the past three seasons. Many of those deals have been struck with Chelsea, including nine transfers from London in this season alone."

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final game in Europe as a manager. O’Neill created such wonderful European memories for Celtic’s support during his first tenure as the manager that departing with a smile felt entirely valid. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first ever competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal after 33 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that it worthy of great credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have scored a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite both sets of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a week that is likely to define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ponderous and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe opening goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. McCowan was Celtic’s stand-out performer during the opening period, the former Dundee player continually taking up positions that seemed to confuse the Germans.\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved domination of possession but a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of the visitors’ goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nSebastian Hoeness used the interval to replace Jamie Leweling with Chris Führich. The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm fixture. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident appeared as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were now only 25 minutes from that overdue win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly disallowed for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious on two counts; they had been trying to make a substitution when the referee restarted play with a drop ball and Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "Igor Tudor says the salvage operation he has taken on at Tottenham is tougher than he envisaged and most likely his hardest job in management.\n\nThe interim coach, who is preparing for Sunday’s Premier League trip to Fulham, has worked with his new squad since the beginning of last week, having replaced the sacked Thomas Frank. Tudor lost his first game 4-1 at home to Arsenal on Sunday, which left Spurs four points above the relegation zone.\n\nAn alarming fitness situation has improved slightly with the return to training of Pedro Porro and Kevin Danso, meaning Tudor will be without eight injured players at Fulham, plus the suspended Cristian Romero, though Micky van de Ven is expected to be fit.\n\nSpurs are without a win in nine league matches and Tudor’s eyes are wide open about the scale of the task. “Probably, yes … I agree with you,” Tudor said when asked whether the role was more difficult than expected.\n\n“It’s very tough … but it is how it is. So daily work, focus, raising in all things we need to do – physical condition, mental confidence, performance – and waiting for the [injured] players to come back.”\n\nTudor started work as a manager in 2013 and is now in his 12th job. Is Spurs the biggest challenge? “Probably,” he said. “If I recognise the difficulties there are, probably, yes. It’s an even bigger challenge, an even bigger motivation to do this and we do it.”\n\nTudor described Spurs’ plight before the Arsenal game as an “emergency situation” and he warmed to the theme before another derby. “It’s not looking to the style at this moment,” he said. “Because now it’s a question of life and death.\n\n“There is not too much time to think about performance or style. Every game needs to be prepared in that way. How we can take these points, one way or the other?\n\n“In Italy, they use the term ‘have the mentality of a small team’. That is the key, to always have motivation when you play big teams. So that’s the start, of course, and we work a lot on that. The players are aware of the situation.”\n\nLike Frank before him, Tudor refused to use the R word – relegation. “I never used it but not because it’s something too scary or it’s a danger word or we won’t sleep,” he said. “It’s about that we need to refocus on ourselves.”"

            "content": "The Premier League is to launch its own streaming service, with live coverage of all 380 matches over a season available directly to fans – but only if you live in Singapore.\n\nKnown as Premier League Plus, the new app will be launched before next season and will be the first time match coverage will be sold direct to consumers.\n\nDescribed by the Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, as simply being a “learning” opportunity, the move will still cause shockwaves throughout the game as the world’s biggest domestic football league moves to directly control its revenues without the need for a broadcast partner.\n\n“From next season onward, from August, Premier League Plus is going to happen,” Masters said. “For the first time the Premier League is going to have its own customers. We’re looking to build a business, but we’re also looking to learn to see how that might be replicable around the world.”\n\nMasters told the Financial Times Business of Football Summit in London that Premier League Plus would be offered in partnership with the existing rights holder, Starhub, and would be a “24-seven” service.\n\n“It’s going to be a really exciting product, and the big change is I think that the Premier League will have its own customers and means us delving into things like promotion and pricing,” said Masters. “That’s why it’s an important step for us.”\n\nThe idea of a “Premflix” offering has been speculated on for a number of years. Premier League club owners have backed the idea, with Chelsea’s Todd Boehly telling the FT conference last year that the league should sell its global rights direct to the streaming service Netflix. Instead, the Premier League has gone for a trial approach, with Masters telling an audience of industry insiders that international broadcast revenues had grown by 27% through the latest three-year rights cycle.\n\nView image in fullscreen The Premier League’s Richard Masters says its new app is ‘an important step for us’. Photograph: Jon Super/AP\n\nAlso appearing at the conference was the chair of the Independent Football Regulator, David Kogan. He called on the Premier League and EFL to come to a new “long-term sustainable agreement” over financial redistribution, arguing that it would lead to “less regulation” in the future.\n\nKogan also reaffirmed that parachute payments, which have been a barrier to any resolution between the Premier League and EFL, would come under scrutiny as part of the forthcoming State of the Game review. “Parachute payments are not going to vanish overnight,” Kogan said, “[but] the discussion about parachute payments is a fundamental part of the discussion about distribution.”\n\nThe chair of the EFL, Rick Parry, also speaking at the summit, said that parachute payments had represented 6% of EFL turnover when introduced in 1992, but by the 2018-19 season had reached 173% of turnover. The wage bill of clubs in receipt of the payments was more than double that of the rest of the Championship. “The Premier League chase is the most expensive lottery ticket on the planet,” he said.\n\nKogan said he believed the “backstop” option which would allow the regulator to impose a distribution deal would not need to be activated and that the leagues would come to a deal independently. Masters said that while “we’re all agreed we want a strong pyramid”, he thought “it should be left to the organisations to come up with these agreements”."

            "content": "Senne Lammens revels in the “war” of being Manchester United’s goalkeeper in the hugely physical Premier League yet remains bemused at being applauded when entering a primary school classroom on a Wednesday afternoon.\n\nClearly the 23-year-old is still adjusting to a rocketing career trajectory. Following his £18m transfer from Royal Antwerp on 1 September, Lammens made his debut in the 2-0 win against Sunderland on 4 October, and established himself as the first choice with a faultless start that featured five clean sheets in 21 league games.\n\nTo do so in the relentless glare at United is impressive. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton, Lammens was again calm and assured, producing vital saves while navigating the hurly-burly of set pieces and corners as players crowded his goalmouth.\n\nView image in fullscreen Senne Lammens is first to the ball while under pressure from Everton’s Thierno Barry as the United goalkeeper keeps another clean sheet. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images\n\nLammens shrugs when considering the chaos he faces at dead balls. “Physically Everton was a big battle, a big game so I’m still recovering from that,” Lammens says. “It’s been like this. It’s just the way it is – the Premier League, it’s physicality and a bit of war in the 18-yard box.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in and with a robust frame, the young Belgian is built for the game’s demands. “It’s one of my strengths,” he says, “so sometimes I like the challenge as well. Of course it can get too much sometimes but everyone has to deal with it. It’s not like only one team does it, it’s everyone in general.\n\n“As a goalkeeper you have to get used to that and train for it and get better at it. I’ve been doing a good job at it so I’ll continue to do that. The club said to me that it was the most physical. It’s the best league but the physicality is the biggest difference. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper.\n\n“In Belgium it’s less physical but still the principles are the same. Here there are a bit more bodies in front of you, but my team has helped me out with blocking guys. You have to be big and not be pushed around easily.”\n\nLammens suggests that greater protection for keepers may have to be considered. “There have to be certain rules,” he says. “You can’t get to the point where it’s too [unfair]. That’s something the Premier League has to look towards.”\n\nLammens made his debut for Club Brugge in July 2021 before moving to Antwerp two years later. He remained uncapped at senior level for Belgium until November’s 7-0 win over Liechtenstein, replacing one of his heroes. “Thibaut Courtois was always a big thing when I was growing up because his saving is just world class,” Lammens says of the 33-year-old Real Madrid goalkeeper.\n\nView image in fullscreen ‘You have to be big and not be pushed around easily,’ says the 23-year-old. Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock\n\nBayern Munich’s 39-year-old Manuel Neuer was another source of inspiration. “When I was growing up my biggest idol was probably Neuer,” he says. “I take pride in being an all-around goalkeeper and that’s why I was such a big fan because he didn’t really have a weak point, so that’s something I want to take from him. But I try to learn something from everyone because everyone has strong points.”\n\nLammens is speaking at a Manchester United Foundation event at Partington Central Academy for World Book Day. The surprise at being cheered by pupils draws comparison with being ambushed by paparazzi this month when leaving the Ivy in Manchester after dining with his partner.\n\n“That was one of the more special moments. Special, like I couldn’t believe it. It’s not always the best feeling – they weren’t too bad. But for my girlfriend and I this was the first time with paparazzi. Looking back, it was quite funny. The club warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise.\n\n“It’s a bit new for me, but it’s also probably one of my best feelings when you go into [schools] and see all those children cheering for you and they don’t believe it’s you. Because I was there once in my life, it’s not that long ago. I still remember those times.”\n\nAway from the game, Lammens reads – his favourite book is Paulo Coelho’s The Alchemist – and follows other sports. “I don’t really watch a lot of football because on a daily basis you’re doing a lot with football,” he says. “You want to switch off mentally. Of course you still have to watch other people play but everyone has his own experiences so the best learning school is yourself, your own experiences.\n\n“I’m a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing. Especially how they prepare for the game and think about their game. Like in the NBA and with, for example, Kobe Bryant or LeBron James.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Lammens with the pupils of Partington Central Academy. Photograph: MUFC\n\nAfter being recommended by Tony Coton, United’s goalkeeping scout, as the replacement for the erratic André Onana, Lammens has developed a rewarding working relationship with Tom Heaton, the third-choice keeper. He served early notice of his quality when gathering a corner with authority against Sunderland. It drew a rousing cheer from the Old Trafford faithful.\n\n“It was really nice getting the support from the fans and my teammates, the best feeling in the beginning. And they also gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.”\n\nIn an improving campaign under Michael Carrick that has garnered 16 points from the interim manager’s first six games, Lammens wants to maintain consistency. “I don’t really want to look too much into the past,” he says. “It’s been great but I still have to prove myself every week. I just have to keep going now. It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world but also you have to look through that – it’s still a game of football, the game isn’t that much different.”"

            "content": "The big winners\n\nBodø/Glimt’s 2-1 defeat of Inter at San Siro continued this season’s miracle. The post-match discussion between Inter coach Cristian Chivu and his opposite number, Kjetil Knutsen, was one of admiration, an acknowledgment the Norwegian team had been too good for the runaway Serie A leaders. Even though Inter were without Lautaro Martínez, their standard bearer, a comeback seemed likely as they dominated the early stages. But they found no way through, eventually falling victim to the high-quality, high-speed attacking that had left them with a 3-1 deficit to overcome from the first leg.\n\n“The hardest thing was to create an opening,” lamented Inter’s Nicolò Barella of the long spell of toil that preceded Jens Petter Hauge stabbing in his sixth goal in this season’s competition before Håkon Evjen completed a counter and sealed progress with a brilliant strike.\n\n“We tried everything we could,” Chivu said. Like Manchester City and Atlético Madrid before them, Inter were dumbfounded by the team laying claim to be Scandinavia’s best since IFK Gothenburg picked up two Uefa Cups in the 1980s and reached the European Cup semi-final in 1986.\n\nGalatasaray are into the last 16 after goals by Victor Osimhen and Barış Alper Yilmaz in extra time at Juventus. That tells nothing of the full story of a classic tie, which almost became a classic comeback. Probably the main reason Juve did not fully overturn their 5-2 first-leg deficit was the dismissal of Lloyd Kelly, a red card awarded by video assistant when the on-field official had already awarded a second yellow. How video officials reached that decision was mysterious, controversial; Kelly looked to have accidentally landed on Yilmaz. The Englishman initially believed VAR would come to his rescue but stormed down the tunnel. He missed out on the ecstatic scenes that followed Weston McKennie levelling the tie at 5-5. In injury time, though, Juve ran out of legs, counting the cost of a third red card in four matches.\n\nIn Wednesday’s earlier game, Atalanta had already preserved the dignity of Serie A with a 4-1 defeat of Borussia Dortmund. Atalanta trailed 2-0 from the first leg but perhaps we should have paid attention to a telling stat before kick-off: there has been an Italian team in the last 16 of the competition every season since 1987-88. In Bergamo, Mario Pašalić’s header put Atalanta 3-2 up on aggregate, only for Karim Adeyemi’s lovely goal to push the tie towards extra time. The denouement was bizarre: Dortmund defender Ramy Bensebaini was sent off after his studs caught the head of Atalanta’s Nikola Krstović in the penalty area as he attempted a backheel flick. Lazar Samardžić stepped up in the ninth minute of added time, with all Atalanta’s usual penalty takers subbed off, to score the spot-kick. He lashed it home to maintain the honour of Italian calcio.\n\nJosé Mourinho has now lost his last 10 Champions League knockout ties. At Real Madrid, parking the Benfica bus did not prove a successful strategy. Although this time it was a literal bus: Mourinho, banned after his red card in the first leg, watched the second leg sat in the team coach. Benfica scored first at the Santiago Bernabéu against a rather languid Madrid through Rafa Silva, only to leave space for Aurélien Tchouaméni to score from distance. In the 80th minute, Vinícius Júnior scored the decider of an edgy match, issuing the final word on a tie that concluded with relative calm. The fallout from last week’s first leg, in which Benfica’s Gianluca Prestianni was accused of racially abusing Vinícius, may continue for some time. “Mourinho and I were in contact and share the same feeling: frustration and pride,” said Benfica’s assistant coach, João ­Tralhão. Mourinho’s thoughts remain private. For now, at least.\n\nPlayer of the week\n\nIt all came up Norway, as Alexander Sørloth, the one-time Bodø/Glimt loanee, scored the treble for Atlético Madrid that ended Club Brugge’s participation. Sørloth will probably partner Erling Haaland at the summer’s World Cup. The 30-year-old has a harsh journeyman reputation but his skillset has found its home within a Diego Simeone team undergoing a reboot. The hat-trick was Sørloth’s fifth goal in two matches, after a weekend double against Espanyol. They said it\n\n“There are moments when you lose precision and it’s difficult to recover the level.” Luis Enrique breathed a sigh of relief after Paris Saint-Germain’s 2-2 draw with Monaco, who had Mamadou Coulibaly harshly sent off and missed a golden chance to level the tie when Wout Faes headed wide. As it was, the holders squeezed through 5-4 on aggregate. They remain unconvincing, and are yet to find the stride of last season.\n\nThe pundit’s chair\n\n“Italian teams play at a slow pace. When they find teams that play press and run, they don’t have the quality, aren’t accustomed to playing at a high pace, and make mistakes … As soon as they increase the pace in Serie A, they are stopped because a challenge is too hard, a player’s ear is touched, and they go down. These are the results. We play at a slow pace, unfortunately, and when it happens, it’s hard to be dangerous.” Champions League-winning coach Fabio Capello, speaking after Inter’s exit on Sky Italia, diagnoses the Serie A malaise.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nFriday’s last 16 draw takes place in Nyon, Switzerland, and the playoffs, or “punishment round” as some insiders term it, have opened up some potentially huge ties. Paris Saint-Germain face either Barcelona or Chelsea. Galatasaray’s reward is one of Liverpool or Tottenham, whose interim coach Igor Tudor had a stint with the Turkish club.\n\nManchester City could face familiar foes: Real Madrid, with whom they have clashed plenty of times before in recent years, or Bodø/Glimt, who shocked them in January. There’s also the potential of an all-English tie in Newcastle v Chelsea, and an all-German one in Bayer Leverkusen v Bayern Munich."

            "content": "Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, replied forcefully on Thursday to concerns about a holdup of federal funding for this summer’s World Cup, confirming that “no funds have been awarded yet” in a post on X. About $625m in grants administered by the Federal Emergency Management Authority (Fema) were authorized last summer and set to be distributed to US host cities to aid with security and planning for the tournament, which will be co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.\n\nNoem’s comments follow congressional testimony earlier this week by host city officials who expressed concern that they may not have time to adequately prepare for the tournament if they don’t receive the funds in short order.\n\nOn Thursday, Noem said the ongoing partial government shutdown – which directly affects Fema – is the reason for the holdup, placing the blame on Democratic senators. The Department of Homeland Security, which includes Fema, has been unfunded since 13 February after lawmakers failed to approve the agency’s appropriations bill. Senate Democrats have said the agency will remain unfunded until the Trump administration places new restrictions on immigration and enforcement operations after a pair of fatal shootings by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\n“Fema was in the final stages of reviewing applications to ensure proper oversight when Democrats shut down the government putting significant portions of the Fema staff on administrative leave,” Noem wrote in her post. “No funds have been awarded yet under the Fifa World Cup grant program. The longer DHS goes without funding, the less prepared our nation will be for threats at the Fifa World Cup and America 250.”\n\nNoem’s statement drew sharp pushback from Nellie Pou, the Democratic congresswoman from New Jersey who serves as the ranking member of the House homeland security taskforce on enhancing security for special events. Pou had previously voiced her concerns at the DHS committee hearing earlier this week.\n\n“This is simply not true,” Pou wrote on X. “World Cup security funding was enacted into law last summer and these matches have been scheduled for years. DHS’ own notice of funding opportunity of this grant program listed the anticipated award date as ‘no later than January 30, 2026.’ Well before the funding impasse. It’s time for DHS to do its job.”\n\nPou, whose congressional district includes MetLife Stadium – which will host the World Cup final – was joined in concern by officials representing a pair of other World Cup host cities, Miami and Kansas City. In their testimony, those officials both expressed worry that they may have to cancel events, including fan festivals, if funding isn’t soon released.\n\n“We are quickly approaching [our deadline],” testified Raymond Martinez, the chief operating officer of the Miami host committee. “We are 107 days out from the tournament, but more importantly we are about 70-something days out from starting to build the fan fest. These decisions have to be made, generously, within the next 30 days. Our local agencies are very anxious. Without receiving this money, it would be catastrophic for our planning and coordination.”\n\nCongress and the White House have made no visible progress on ending the funding impasse. On Tuesday, a Senate vote failed to garner the 60 votes needed to advance a funding bill. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, criticized Republican lawmakers after the vote, saying they hadn’t made meaningful attempts to negotiate and had not “budged on any key issues”."

She initially refused but then said yes in a bid to get him to leave more quickly.\n\n\n\nRasooli returned to his car, fetched two bottles of wine – and again put his hand on her breast, Mr Allen said.\n\nThe court heard he also picked up her phone, entered his own number and later called her on June 27 and 28.\n\nJust days later, on July 3 at about 2pm, Rasooli struck again.\n\nHe went to another address in Maidstone, stepped over the threshold of a woman’s flat and began asking personal questions.\n\nAfter handing over her food, he ran his hand down her body and touched her breast, the prosecution said.\n\n\n\nBoth shaken women reported the incidents to police.\n\nWhen interviewed, Rasooli “essentially says cultural misunderstanding” in respect of the first incident, Mr Allen added.\n\nIn a powerful victim statement, the first woman said she is now “paranoid about every vehicle and person which comes outside my house” and feels as though she “can’t trust anyone who comes to my door”.\n\nShe told the court she struggled to sleep and said: “I feel constantly nervous whilst being at home, it used to be my safe place but since it happened it isn’t.”\n\nDefending, Jagmohan Takk said Rasooli had no previous convictions.\n\n\n\nBut jurors convicted him after trial of three counts of sexual assault.\n\nRasooli, of Maidstone, was jailed for two years and six months on counts one and two, and two years and two months on count three, to run concurrently.\n\nHe will serve up to half his sentence in prison before being released on licence.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nHe was also placed on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely and handed a five-year sexual harm prevention order.\n\nThe order bans him from visiting a customer’s address while working as a delivery driver or accompanying anyone else on their rounds."

That man was on bail for domestic violence against Mary, and he still went back and killed her. So do not tell me a licence is going to stop him.\n\n“I want to see him die in prison, and I hope and pray to God that every night he closes his eyes, he thinks of Mary and she haunts him.”\n\nThe Parole Board confirmed a panel had directed Williams’ release.\n\nA spokesperson said: “Parole Board decisions are solely focused on what risk a prisoner could represent to the public if released and whether that risk is manageable in the community.\n\n“A panel will carefully examine a huge range of evidence, including details of the original crime, and any evidence of behaviour change, as well as explore the harm done and the impact the crime has had on the victims.\n\n\n\n“Members read and digest hundreds of pages of evidence and reports in the lead-up to an oral hearing.\n\n“Evidence from witnesses such as probation officers, psychiatrists and psychologists, officials supervising the offender in prison, as well as victim’s personal statements may be given at the hearing.\n\n“It is standard for the prisoner and witnesses to be questioned at length during the hearing, which often lasts a full day or more.\n\n“Parole reviews are undertaken thoroughly and with extreme care. Protecting the public is our number one priority.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nFor Mary’s family, though, the horror did not end in 2005.\n\n\n\nNow they face the agonising prospect that killer could soon be free."

            "content": "LOCKED OUT Spanish anti-tourist campaigners superglue 500 rental lockboxes in one night in act of ‘sabotage’ against holidaymakers\n\nA SPANISH pressure group has declared war on British tourists visiting one of the nation’s most popular destinations.\n\nIn a single evening, 500 lockboxes holding keys to rental properties in the ancient city of Granada were rendered inoperable with super glue before being covered with stickers reading: “Against the housing business.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Granada Housing Union has claimed responsibility for the coordinated sabotage, saying it has moved onto the “offensive” against what it describes as the “business of housing”.\n\nThe action was concentrated in the Albaicin, Realejo and city centre areas – neighbourhoods with a high density of tourist apartments and long-standing complaints from residents about rising rents, the displacement of permanent neighbours and changes to local commerce.\n\nAccording to the union, housing campaign groups have repeatedly warned that official regulations are insufficient to curb the spread of short-term lets and claim that enforcement and sanctions against offenders are often lacking.\n\n\n\nThe protest comes amid growing tension over tourism-driven housing pressures.\n\nSince the start of 2025, the Junta de Andalucia has cancelled 13,037 tourist rental registrations across the region, including 2,138 in Granada province – 1,198 of them in the city itself.\n\nMeanwhile, the Association of Tourist Homes and Rural Accommodation of Granada has condemned what it called a “wave of vandalism”, estimating the damage at more than £4,000.\n\nThe association said most affected properties belong to small landlords, self-employed individuals and local families running legal businesses, reported The Spanish Eye.\n\n\n\nIt has urged owners to report incidents to the National Police and called for an immediate investigation, identification of those responsible and increased night-time police presence in the affected areas.\n\nAvitar has also demanded a public condemnation of the attacks by local and regional authorities and criticised what it describes as institutional rhetoric that “criminalises” legal property owners.\n\nElsewhere in Spain, lawmakers are debating a proposal that would block non-residents from buying property unless they have lived on the island for at least five years.\n\nIf passed, it could freeze thousands of Brits out of hotspots like Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza.\n\nThe radical bill, tabled by left-wing party Més per Mallorca, seeks to curb soaring house prices and the relentless march of tourism.\n\n\n\nAround 90,000 homes across the Balearics Islands, which make up some 16 per cent of all properties, are already owned by foreign nationals.\n\nBritish buyers remain a powerhouse, with nearly 12,000 homes snapped up by UK purchasers in 2024 alone, according to Idealista.\n\nLluis Apesteguia, an MP for Més per Mallorca, insisted that “extraordinary measures were necessary” after the islands welcomed 19 million visitors last year.\n\nHe said: “We have to prioritise the houses that are for living in – not for those who want to speculate and continue with this game of Monopoly.”\n\nThis is the latest attempt by Spain to rein in foreign buyers.\n\n\n\nLast year Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez pledged a tax of up to 100 per cent on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, promising it would tackle the country’s deepening housing crisis.\n\nThe measure has yet to pass parliament – and critics warn it could spark a buying frenzy as overseas purchasers rush to beat any new rules.\n\nThis extremism is set against a backdrop of spiralling anti-tourist fury across Spain.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn October, locals screamed “go home” at Dutch cycling holidaymakers in Valencia, with shoving matches breaking out in the Old Town before the tourists fled chanting “f*** you”.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey found 56 per cent of Brits who normally holiday in Spain went elsewhere in 2025, with nearly 80 per cent saying the protests had made the UK’s favourite destination less appealing."

            "content": "AFTER Winter Swan-Miller murdered a man in a frenzied bloodbath that saw him stabbed 27 times, she didn’t show any remorse.\n\nInstead, she took to TikTok to boast about killing Stuart Crocker and told followers she had been a “bad girl”. Shocking as it may seem, Swan-Miller isn’t the only criminal to take to social media to boast about their crimes – and often get caught out by their own warped arrogance.\n\n\n\nFrom convicted criminals posting videos from inside their prison cells and crooks taunting police about their crimes, to burglars posting footage as they ransack people’s homes, it seems that some can’t resist taking to social media, despite the obvious risks.\n\n\n\nCriminologist Alex Iszatt says that while boasting about deadly criminal activity online may seem extreme, it is just an excessive extension of the craving for attention social media creates.\n\n“Social media runs on self promotion, we boast about meals, holidays, relationships, promotions, milestones, to present a version of ourselves that feels more interesting, more successful and more visible,” she explains.\n\n“We see others do it, and get rewarded with attention and we want that too.\n\n“Therefore boasting about dangerous or even criminal behaviour isn’t some completely separate impulse, it’s just learned behaviour.\n\n“When we post we aren’t just another cog in a system, we can matter – even if to a few people – the need for attention overrides punishment, consequences are a future problem.\n\n\n\n“For some, oversharing online is almost instinctive because they have learned that visibility validates existence.\n\n“If you see others being praised or getting attention for being reckless, smart, or outrageous, it becomes a template: even if your instincts tell you not to, the combination of personality disorder, insecurity, or a hollow sense of self can override caution.”\n\nWinter Swan-Miller, 37, of Andover, Hampshire, stabbed 62-year-old Stuart Crocker 27 times before strangling him with the strap of her handbag at his flat in 2023.\n\nWinchester Crown Court heard Swan-Miller, who had been staying with her victim, posted a video on TikTok after the murder on June 23, 2023.\n\nIn it she said she had been a “bad girl” and urged people to write to her in prison, and also wrote numerous notes about the killing.\n\n\n\nIn the video, she brazenly said she did not “feel I’ve done a bad thing at all”.\n\nPolice found further unpublished videos, including one where she claimed Stuart was complicit in her dog being stolen.\n\nThe court heard she was hoping for ‘fame and notoriety’ before she was convicted of murder in 2024 and jailed for a minimum of 23 years.\n\n‘Magic trick’ killer\n\n\n\nIn another shocking case, the murderer of Sabrina Cooper, the late niece of legendary comedian Tommy, was discovered due to his activity on TikTok.\n\nThe night before Tony King stabbed to death the grandmother in her flat, he posted a video to his 11,000 fans stating: “Watch out for my next magic trick, it’s going to be amazing.”\n\nPolice would also discover an unpublished TikTok video, where he recorded himself saying: “I have just taken a life today.”\n\nKing, of Eastbourne, was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2023.\n\nThat same year, a “TikTok addict” killer was jailed after filming himself dancing around the luxury home of a businesswoman, having strangling her to death with her hairdryer lead.\n\n\n\nRomanian Mohamed El-Abboud, 28, and Syrian Kusai Al-Jundi, 25, had been attempting to seize 71-year old Louise Kam’s multi-million pound property portfolio by tricking her into signing documents.\n\nThe pair murdered her after she refused to sign, killing her in her home in East Barnet, London.\n\nIt was here that El-Abboud then filmed himself dancing in a clip that he then uploaded to the social media app.\n\nThey were jailed for at least 35 years in February 2023.\n\nTeen monsters\n\nIn 2024, the mother of a murdered boy faced further horror when she came across a video of one of her son’s killers rapping about her crimes.\n\n\n\nEighteen-year-old Jack Woodley was attacked by a gang of teenagers back in October 2021 while he was walking home from a festival in the town of Houghton-le-Spring in North East England.\n\nThe teenager died from his injuries after being repeatedly kicked, stamped on, and stabbed by the 10-strong group, who were subsequently jailed.\n\nHis mum, Zoey McGill, then came across a disturbing video filmed in prison that showed one of the killers boasting about only receiving a short sentence for his crime, as well as bragging about having a phone while wearing a designer T-shirt.\n\nAnother teen killer, Taylor Meanley, was also caught gloating about his crimes in December last year, again in a rap video filmed in jail.\n\n\n\nThe remorseless thug was jailed for 27 years in 2021 when, aged just 17, he gunned down Lewis Williams in a targeted drive-by attack in Mexborough, Doncaster.\n\nRapping under the name “T Shots”, the killer could be heard making references to the murder and his love of shotguns while wearing casual clothing.\n\nThe clips were shared to Instagram to a profile that amassed more than 10,000 followers before eventually being taken down.\n\nStreet fighter’s brags\n\nNot all criminals chasing social media fame have deadly intentions, but their actions can still have brutal and dire consequences.\n\nIn November last year, a man was recalled to prison after filming his friend on the ground after they’d had a drunken brawl.\n\n\n\nKyle Clark, 26, had gone out in Middlesbrough to celebrate having his electronic tag removed after being jailed for ploughing into two people in his car.\n\nBut the celebrations ended with his best friend in hospital and him back behind bars after they had a drunken fight.\n\nClark’s friend threw the first punches before falling over in the street. But then Clark kicked him in the head.\n\nWhen he was arrested, police found a TikTok video on Clark’s phone – which read: “When you put your best pal to sleep. No way to control his f***ing punches. I kicked him once.”\n\n\n\nThe victim suffered a depressed fracture to his skull in the attack, and bleeding on his brain, although he eventually made a full recovery.\n\nClark was recalled to prison to serve the remainder of his previous sentence. He later pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, on the basis that he did not start the altercation.\n\n‘Livestreamed’ crime\n\nMeanwhile, a man who boasted on TikTok of fooling cops soon found that his social media brags would contribute to his downfall.\n\nKabelo Monyebudi, of East Grinstead, was stopped and searched at a train station last February. Nothing was found on him, as he had hidden the knife he was carrying in a train bin before he was searched.\n\nBut he then decided to record himself retrieving the distinctive knife and posted it on TikTok with the caption ‘got to be one step ahead of the boys in blue’.\n\n\n\nHistory is full of arrogant, narcissistic, attention-seeking people who sought to impress, intimidate, or control perception Alex Iszatt\n\nTwo weeks later, officers spotted him and despite his best efforts to ditch the same knife in a nearby hedge and run away, he was arrested on suspicion of possessing a bladed article in a public place.\n\nThanks to the distinctive nature of the knife – and his TikTok video – he was further arrested for the first offence and subsequently charged.\n\nMonyebudi was given a six month sentence, suspended for 18 months, after pleading guilty to two counts of possessing a bladed article in a public place. He was also ordered to complete a rehabilitation activity requirement, and the knife was destroyed.\n\nOthers think of themselves as above the law.\n\n\n\nRyan Chalmers, 33, who referred to himself as “Scottish Rambo” , filmed himself live on TikTok as he stole £3,000 from his ex-girlfriend’s flat and bragged about being in her home without permission\n\nNaturally, his former partner recognised her living room from the video and called the police. Chalmers was jailed for two years in June last year.\n\n‘Arrogant, narcissistic & attention-seeking’\n\nAlex Iszatt says while these boasting crooks all have social media in common, their true common ground is arrogance.\n\nShe explains: “Take Winter Swan-Miller, who called herself a ‘bad girl’ after killing a man, the man who taunted police on TikTok after hiding a knife, or the man who boasted about ‘putting his friend to sleep’ after a drunken fight.\n\n“What unites them isn’t the platform, it’s a pattern of arrogance and entitlement, combined with an inability to cope with shame.\n\n\n\n“Bragging is a mask. It’s a way to project control, cleverness, or danger, while keeping their true insecurity underneath hidden.\n\n“The more fragile the individual, the more extreme the behaviour, and the more they risk because they have nothing else to stake their identity on.\n\n“People give so much of themselves away because, at the root, they have nothing, their internal world is empty, and oversharing can fill that void.\n\n“It’s a performance which allows them to control their own story, no one can define them as ordinary.\n\n\n\n“This isn’t a new psychological phenomenon, history is full of arrogant, narcissistic, attention-seeking people who sought to impress, intimidate, or control perception.\n\n“Social media hasn’t created them. It has only lowered the barriers, made their actions visible, and given them immediate feedback.”"

            "content": "TWO young ski mountaineers have been killed in a horror avalanche in northern Italy after a snow cornice gave way beneath their feet.\n\nMarika Mascherona, 28, and Alberto De Maron, 27, were swept to their deaths on the southwest face of Mount Cornaccia in Valdidentro on Thursday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pair, both from Valtellina, were buried under tonnes of snow near the Cancano dams in the province of Sondrio.\n\nRescuers clawed through the snow as helicopters thudded overhead, but it was too late.\n\nThey told Corriere della Sera that “a snow cornice broke away from under their feet, and they fell down the rocks with the avalanche.”\n\n\n\nThe alarm was raised just before 11am after three people were caught up in the high-altitude slide.\n\nMascherona, from Bormio and sister of Italian national ski mountaineer Katia Mascherona, and De Maron, from Grosotto, were pulled lifeless from the snowdrift.\n\nA third ski mountaineer, who witnessed the tragedy and called for help, was treated at the scene but did not need hospital treatment.\n\nEmergency crews, including technicians from the National Alpine and Speleological Rescue Corps, firefighters from Sondrio and the Guardia di Finanza’s Alpine Rescue team, battled treacherous conditions to secure the slope.\n\n\n\nThe operation was coordinated by AREU 118, with two rescue helicopters scrambled from Sondrio and Bergamo.\n\nRescuers continued sweeping the mountainside amid fears of further collapses.\n\nThe deadly slide comes as avalanche risk across Lombardy spikes due to unseasonably warm temperatures.\n\nARPA Lombardia had warned in its morning bulletin of a “locally increased avalanche danger during the warmest hours at intermediate altitudes.”\n\nThe agency said in a snow bulletin: “The temperature trend of recent days has favoured an increase in natural avalanche activity, including ground-level avalanches, due to the wetting of the snowpack and the resulting heavier weight on the uppermost layers.”\n\n\n\nForecasters said weakening internal bonds within the snowpack had led to the triggering of even very large avalanches on most steep slopes.\n\nThey added that the situation is gradually improving, with fewer potentially dangerous slopes as natural avalanche activity stabilises the snow.\n\nThey explained that in the early hours of the day the snowpack is frozen at all altitudes, with surface melt-and-freeze crusts forming.\n\nBut as temperatures rise into the central hours, those crusts and internal bonds weaken down to 2,500 metres.\n\n\n\nAt the highest altitudes, the snow remains dry and winter-like, with widespread highly cohesive, load-bearing slabs still present.\n\nInvestigators are now probing the exact chain of events that led to the fatal collapse.\n\nThe stretch of mountain above the Cancano lakes – close to the Swiss border – has seen similar avalanches in recent days.\n\nHuge avalanches have swept Europe this winter leaving record fatalities in their wake.\n\nSeveral ski resorts have been forced to shut as avalanche danger levels surged to the highest levels across vast stretches of the Alps.\n\n\n\nThe death toll across France, Italy, Switzerland and Austria has already climbed above 60 this season alone.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nIn the French Alps at least 27 people have died this year, including three British skiers who died in the past week.\n\nIt marks France’s highest death toll since the 2020 to 2021 season when 40 people lost their lives in avalanches."

We each have one arm and leg we can control respectively. \" The pair subsequently elaborated on how their physiology developed and which sister possessed certain advantages.\" The post continued: \"Lia's lungs have been compressed by my body and on top of that she has severe scoliosis in her spine.\"\n\nThe sisters candidly discussed their sexual orientations before welcoming questions from followers. They said: \"Yes, I am a lesbian and Lia is straight. I've had a girlfriend although we split it off when I went to university, and she has had a long-distance boyfriend when we were teens.\" The pair explained they chose to share their experiences publicly so curious people could send questions to them, rather than pestering other conjoined twins who were not comfortable.\n\nThe subject of masturbation was amongst the first topics raised, which the twins described as \"uncomfortable\", reports the Mirror US. When one follower enquired how \"often\" the sisters engaged in self-pleasure, the sisters replied: \"We have masturbated in the past, but we've agreed not to do it as it was too uncomfortable for us.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA separate user then questioned whether the act felt like \"incest\" to the twins. The sisters acknowledged it felt awkward, though not incestuous and said: \"With masturbation, it wasn't that it felt like incest, it was more like: imagine this. Imagine someone touching your shoulder, incessantly. It would be pretty annoying and weird right? That's what it's like if Lia touches our vagina, it feels like someone messing around with your body.\"\n\nOnline followers also asked whether both experienced physical arousal considering their conjoined bodies. One twin said: \"On the arousal part, sort of? Arousal is a complex hormonal communication between the brain and the genitals, so if you aren't the one that's getting aroused you can kind of tell your genitals are aroused without being aroused yourself.\n\n\"It's the same for other things. Like I can tell when she's hungry even if I'm not, or when she's anxious because of her heart rate and I'm not.\" The siblings said they reached an early agreement to avoid sex due to potential complications surrounding pregnancy.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThey said: \"Well that's the thing. Whilst both me and my sister have sexual urges and both experience arousal, we agreed from an early age on that we would not have sex as it would be 1. very uncomfortable for the both of us and 2. the risk of pregnancy is too great. If we got pregnant there's a good chance we would die.\n\nView 3 Images Abby and Brittany Hensel with Abby's husband Josh Bowling (Image: Joshua Bowling/Facebook)\n\n\"However, we will still be intimate with our partners. I would kiss and hug and cuddle with my girlfriend. But she was asexual conveniently so it was not an issue for us. But, this is just what works for us. Other conjoined twins, ie Abby and Brittany, may have more intimate interactions or less, normally yes sex alongside your sibling is weird being a conjoined twin is a completely different experience.

Mia wrote: \"My sister has not given oral and I highly doubt she or I ever will.\"\n\nResponding to a further question about managing their sexual desires, a follower asked: \"You mentioned that you have masturbated before and still get sexual urges and ideally would want asexual partners.

Lol, is orgasming together that awkward?\"\n\nThe sisters joked: \"Haha it's not emotionally awkward we've experienced life together that's not any grosser than anything else. It's more just physically uncomfortable. I can feel when my vagina is touched, and it would be horrifying to have somebody who I'm not in a relationship with touch my private parts and same goes with Lia.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"Imagine having someone touching and playing with your private parts that isn't even involved with you at all. Yeah. And yes we plan to not satisfy our sexual urges. If nuns can do it, so can we lol.\""

He went to Russia in 2015 but returned to Britain due to passport problems. He was detained in the UK and jailed on terrorism offences, but went back to Ukraine after his release.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nLoyalist pro-Kremlin MP Maria Butina announced she had intervened to ensure a Russian passport for the mercenary. \"Ben has already proven his love and loyalty to Russia, his empathy for the residents of the new territories,” she said, referring to invaded areas of Ukraine.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images MP Maria Butina 'intervened' to secure his passport (Image: Maria Butina/e2w)\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

However, this was not confirmed and Stimson has now suggested he is alive. “Aiden is alive and well and always was,” he posted.\n\nEarlier Stimson had said: “Worried about my comrade Aiden Minnis. He's not been seen for a week. I pray all is OK.” Minnis was earlier granted a Russian passport.\n\nView 4 Images Stimson was detained in the UK and jailed on terrorism offences (Image: Ben Stimson/e2w)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nButina, 37, said the leadership of main pro-Putin political party United Russia had backed the granting of citizenship to Stimson. Stimson was jailed for five years and four months at Manchester Crown Court in 2017, after returning from Russia to the UK.\n\nHe has encouraged other English speakers to fight for Putin. Stimson’s father Martin was reported in 2024 to have disowned his son for fighting for Putin.\n\nButina was previously jailed in the US on the espionage charge of \"conspiring to work for a foreign government”.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nNow a prominent MP for the United Russia party, she was arrested in the United States in July 2018 and sentenced to 18 months in prison. She pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to act as a foreign agent.\n\nButina was convicted of seeking to infiltrate conservative groups in the US including the National Rifle Association. She was deported to Russia in October 2019 after her sentence was slightly reduced for good behaviour."

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

            "content": "Frank Warren's lips were legally sealed when he was asked about how the collapse of his fabulously lucrative relationship with boxing's new Saudi paymasters is so cataclysmic that he is taking them to court.\n\n'Can't comment,' he said about suing Their Excellencies.\n\nAlthough Warren was quick to point out that he will still be promoting 'the biggest shows in boxing' with the likes of the unretired Tyson Fury back in the ring in April and the world heavyweight title fight between shock WBO champion Fabio Wardley and former champ Daniel Dubois the month after.\n\nWhen it came to Conor Benn's gross betrayal of his long time promoter Eddie Hearn, Warren was revealing on the one hand with but close-chested on the other.\n\nWarren and Hearn were haters for decades but Benn's lamentable dumping for money of the man who nursed him then backed him throughout his drugs allegations clinched their burying of the hatchet.\n\n'I sent Eddie a little note the morning after that,' said Warren. 'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

Although he never won a world title, Castillo was a key figure in boxing in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as he battled with some of the biggest names in the sport.\n\nHe was 43-0 until he fought the legendary Alexis Arguello in 1980.

'Definitely world championship material in a different era.

'Both him and his family were a great part of my childhood. He always gave great advice, would be there when ya needed him. Going to parties at his place, doing golf charity events. He def was the neighborhood Uncle for alot of us.\n\nCastillo later served as an announcer on many WBC fights from the Forum in Los Angeles\n\n'A Family man, Boxer, Charity planner, we lost. Great one today and too soon. RIP brother hope they got a ring set up so you can box the greats!'\n\nThe native of Lubbock, Texas had six children, including twins. A daughter, Misty, preceded him in death. He is survived by his wife, Cindy.\n\n'It is with deep sadness that I have learned of the passing of my dear friend and champion Ruben Castillo,' WBC president Mauricio Sulamain wrote on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'Now he is in the arms of God.

            "content": "Tyson Fury's comeback opponent, Arslanbek Makhmudov, has sensationally been filmed wrestling a bear ahead of their April bout.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on April 11.\n\nAnd 36-year-old Makhmudov, who has a 21-2 record and a knockout ratio of over 90 per cent, has been seen going to extreme measures to train himself up ahead of their meeting, including wrestling a 'three-metre tall and 400kg' brown bear.\n\nIn the video, Makhmudov can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm. The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

            "content": "Chelsea recorded the highest pretax losses in English football history in the 2024-25 season — but club sources insist it will not force them into selling their biggest stars.\n\nThe European Club Finance and Investment Landscape report listed the 10 largest losses for 2025 and revealed how the Blues, who are owned by Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly, booked a €407million deficit. That has only ever been beaten by Barcelona, who fell into a €555m hole from the 2020-21 campaign.\n\nHowever, Chelsea insiders speaking anonymously insisted to Daily Mail Sport that the reported loss does not reflect their true health, saying it is the result of non-cash accounting adjustments as required by UEFA regulations and tied to the acquisition of the Blues. That includes asset impairments, settlements related to historical matters under the previous ownership, and the resolution of legacy contracts.\n\nThose same sources say, after an internal reset, the club is now profitable on an operating basis and aligned with UEFA as they expect to meet all the obligations under their existing settlement agreement with European football’s governing body. They entered into that agreement after previous financial breaches.\n\nCrucially for supporters, Daily Mail Sport has been told there is no requirement for Chelsea to start selling key players such as Cole Palmer or Moises Caicedo in order to meet regulatory thresholds.\n\nWe are assured there is no financial pressure on them to offload any key members of the squad they do not wish to lose this summer, and that their approach to player trading will be strategic rather than reactive.\n\nDespite winning two trophies - including the Club World Cup - last season, Chelsea are thought to have recorded a staggering record pre-tax loss\n\nChelsea have taken to structuring player contracts with performance incentives tied to Champions League participation, which would help cover the cost of missing out on Europe’s elite competition.\n\nNaturally, they do not hope that scenario occurs at the end of this season, with the Blues still in contention for a top-five finish in the Premier League as they travel to face Arsenal this Sunday.\n\nUEFA’s figures covered the 2024-25 season when Chelsea were competing in the Conference League, which they won. They also finished fourth in the Premier League to return to the Champions League before going on to win the Club World Cup in the summer.\n\nChelsea’s creative financing has helped their financial position in the Premier League, such as the infamous internal selling of their women’s team to the club’s parent company. UEFA’s rules are more stringent as they do not take income into account."

'I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.'\n\nUSA hockey star Brady Tkachuk has fumed over an AI-edited video posted by the White House\n\nWarning - strong language below\n\nWhen asked if he enjoyed the video, he added: 'It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying.\n\n'I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth and never had that thought.'\n\nTrump also sparked controversy after footage of his phone call with the victorious men's team surfaced on social media.\n\nWhile congratulating them on capturing gold, the president joked that he was also 'going to have to bring the women's team' to Washington after they too got past Canada in the final.\n\nHe then added that he 'probably would be impeached' if he didn't extend the invitation to America's female hockey champions.\n\nThe women's team subsequently turned down Trump's invitation due to 'scheduled academic and professional commitments following the Games.'\n\nAnd Tkachuk said he understood why they could have felt insulted by his locker-room joke, which some have labeled misogynistic.\n\nDonald Trump has sparked outrage in the wake of both the men's and women's team's wins\n\nMembers of the men's Olympic hockey team still attended his address to Congress on Tuesday\n\n'I mean, I get it,' he said before detailing the positive relationship between the men's and women's teams. 'We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n'If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.'\n\nTkachuk was also accused by some of shouting 'Close the northern border!' during the congratulatory call with Trump, but he stressed: 'It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.'\n\nDuring his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, Trump announced that the USA women's team will still be visiting the White House at a later date despite rejecting his first invitation.\n\n'They beat a fantastic Canadian team in overtime, as everybody saw. As did the American women who will soon be coming to the White House,' he told a filled chamber of Congress."

            "content": "What's next for Sheffield Wednesday: Inside the key meeting for Mike Ashley bid, how to stop Dejphon Chansiri getting the £16m he's owed, the truth about Bord takeover collapse and why club insiders are happy it did, and EFL sanction that could be fatal\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nOn Thursday, a man called Justin Barnes had a meeting with another man called Julian Pitts – in a summit that could shape the future of the biggest club in England outside of the Premier League.\n\nBarnes is a close associate of Mike Ashley and has been described as the former Newcastle United owner’s ‘most powerful and abrasive lieutenant’. Pitts is the national managing partner for restructuring at administrators Begbies Traynor, who are overseeing the sale of crisis-hit Sheffield Wednesday.\n\nDaily Mail Sport understands the meeting had been in the diary for some time and was not called to discuss the club, but it is safe to assume that Wednesday will have featured heavily in Thursday’s conversation, 24 hours after the club’s proposed sale collapsed.\n\nIndeed, to those who believe Ashley – with his expertise in distressed businesses – may well be just what is needed in S6, the pre-planned meeting could be the first bit of good fortune to befall Wednesday for some time. Ashley was one of nine interested parties who provided proof of funding to the tune of £50m to Begbies. He also made a bid north of £20m.\n\nLate on Wednesday night that group of nine had an email from Begbies telling them the sale was back on, and that they had a week to make another offer after the Bord Group, who had blown everyone else out of the water with their belief-defying bid of £47.8m, withdrew from the process.\n\nAll of a sudden there is a deal to be done and to a man like Ashley, that could prove too much to resist.\n\nAll of a sudden there is a deal to be done for Sheffield Wednesday and to a man like Mike Ashley, that could prove too much to resist\n\nThe Bord Group's proposed takeover collapsed just three days after Wednesday suffered relegation to League One, at the home of their rivals Sheffield United\n\nThere are many hurdles to overcome for the Sports Direct supremo, and anyone else who fancies a challenge. Much has been made of the EFL’s ‘25p in the pound’ rule that means if a bid fails to provide such compensation to creditors, then the Owls will start next season in League One with a 15-point deduction – something that could prove fatal to attracting a buyer.\n\nSources believe there is a conversation to be had with both the EFL and the Independent Football Regulator. The biggest creditor by far is the club’s hated former owner Dejphon Chansiri, who is owed around £64m. Why should a buyer pay £16m to compensate him for his mistakes?\n\nThere are also non-negotiables for secured creditors. Around £7-8m secures control of the company that owns the stadium, football creditors total around £2.5m, mainly in outstanding fees. A hefty chunk of that is thought to relate to the signing of Ike Ugbo from Troyes, a forward who has subsequently scored zero goals in 54 Championship appearances.\n\nThe taxman is owed around £3m, with administrative and legal costs another £3m. Before you get to Chansiri, it’s already £16m. Double that and you avoid the 15 points. It is, according to those with knowledge of the process, highly unlikely that anyone – including Ashley – will be bidding anywhere near £32m.\n\nThe 25p rule was meant to negate the impact on local businesses. It was not brought in to pay for the wanton mistakes of an owner who nearly put a grand old club in the ground. To that end Ashley, or other interested parties, may even offer to pay that 25p to the non-secured creditors who are not called Chansiri. It is thought such a move would cost around £1.5m.\n\nShould it get to a place where this 159-year-old club stands or falls on a payment to Chansiri, it is hard to see the EFL insisting the money is handed over.\n\nThree or four of the nine have told administrators they remain keen, and Ashley’s main opposition appears to be the Storch group, who told BBC Radio Sheffield this week they are ready and waiting.\n\nBut according to insiders, few were amused last time they made a bid, only to significantly move the goalposts on deadline day by trying to include incentives for promotions to the Championship and Premier League rather than cash up front – of zero use to creditors, who tend to want to be paid now.\n\nThe biggest creditor by far is the club’s hated former owner Dejphon Chansiri, who is owed around £64m. Why should a buyer pay £16m to compensate him for his mistakes?\n\nAn advantage for Ashley and Storch is the transparency of their funding. Ashley would sail through tests given his businesses are based in the UK with information readily available at Companies House. Much of David Storch’s success has come from the aviation services industry in the United States and well-regulated businesses. Again, compliance with EFL and IFR requirements would not be an issue.\n\nSheffield-born entrepreneur Ryan Howsam explored the situation before the Bord group gained exclusivity on Christmas Eve, with a view to making his friend – ex-Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan – part of the management. Jordan lambasted the Chansiri situation on talkSPORT after the collapse while Howsam told local media he would not entertain an offer without assurances that no points deduction would be forthcoming.\n\nSo here we are. And yet there was relief inside Hillsborough when the deal collapsed. ‘It just never smelled right,’ said one club source. ‘It sounds like a really stupid thing to say but there’s a confidence that other, more suitable options are ready to step in.’\n\nHowever, an agent who has experience of dealing with the Bord group at Dunfermline Athletic has only praise. ‘If you put a player in at Dunfermline you get paid straight away,’ they said. As Daily Mail Sport revealed, they paid a non-refundable £2.5m deposit, and further sums paid to keep the club going means they have just set fire to £4m.\n\nGroup member Alsharif Faisal Bin Jamil blamed differences between the bid they had lodged, which later emerged to be that staggering £47.8m, and the actual value of the club. This newspaper asked how – given the amount of time that had passed and due diligence taken – the difference only came to light now.\n\nBin Jamil, a member of the Jordanian royal family, said a structural survey of Hillsborough, which highlighted the full extent of the finance needed, only landed on Monday. Some believe that is a smokescreen, and that the group had realised that they were unlikely to pass either the EFL’s Owners' and Directors' Test or the requirements of the Independent Football Regulator.\n\nSince administrators arrived in October, hundreds of thousands has already been spent on making the stadium safe, which will have given a clue to the costs needed. A local firm working on the South Stand did so for free on the promise they would be paid when the next tranche of EFL money landed in January.\n\nThe Bord group is now history, along with their £4m, and the hope is that Wednesday do not go the same way. Is that a real possibility? If no bid is forthcoming relatively soon it is difficult to see a future, not least because of those stadium costs. The fans’ trust could step in and scale everything back but they would need hundreds of thousands a year to fund an ageing, 40,000-capacity home.\n\nIf no new bidder is forthcoming, the club would need hundreds of thousands a year to fund the maintenance of Hillsborough, their ageing, 40,000-capacity home\n\nIt is to be hoped the ghost of Chansiri does not continue to haunt Sheffield Wednesday\n\nAshley is a man with an eye for a bargain and Wednesday are approaching that territory.\n\nDespite all the problems, this is a club with a huge fanbase and huge potential. Should he get things right, £20m may seem a snip in a few years’ time.\n\nMuch will depend on any points deduction – if a year in League One is difficult to stomach, two may prove impossible. One avenue may be to press for the deduction to be delivered in this already-doomed season.\n\n\n\nIt is to be hoped the ghost of Dejphon Chansiri does not continue to haunt Sheffield Wednesday."

            "content": "Chelsea are ‘shattered’ with Cole Palmer and his fellow stars suffering from burnout, according to the PFA chief executive Maheta Molango, who wants the footballing calendar eased.\n\nMolango used Palmer as an example of why the game’s biggest names are being overworked, highlighting how he is facing a third successive summer without rest. After representing England at the 2024 Euros, and winning the 2025 Club World Cup with Chelsea, he may now head to the 2026 World Cup if selected by Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel.\n\nPalmer registered 33 Premier League goal involvements in 2023-24, and 23 in 2024-25. This season, he has yet to reach double figures, having struggled with injuries which have seen him appear in only 19 of Chelsea’s 42 games in all competitions.\n\nMolango revealed at the FT Business of Football Summit event in London on Thursday how he had visited Chelsea's training ground after the Club World Cup, and saw first-hand how they were struggling. ‘I was at the training camp of Chelsea when they came back (from the Club World Cup),’ Molango said. ‘They were shattered. This is just the reality.\n\n'You wonder whether this is what we wanted as an industry. I'm not sure. I think sometimes we need to be honest with ourselves and understand that sometimes less is more.’\n\nChelsea were left 'shattered' after the Club World Cup, says PFA chief Maheta Molango\n\nPFA boss Maheta Molanga warned that players can only give 60-70 per cent of themselves\n\nHaving already referenced Palmer’s schedule, Molango continued: ‘People say he is a millionaire. Yeah, he is, but it doesn't give you an extra lung or an extra leg.\n\n‘Come to a stage where, you know, “I want to see Cole Palmer on the pitch because he's the one who makes me dream”. The reality is that the fans pay right now 100 per cent of the ticket and a lot of time they get 70 per cent if they're lucky of the show or 60 because players start regulating themselves.\n\n‘The Premier League is the best product in terms of football. They make north of £4billion for 38 games. Surely there's an element of valuing the scarcity.’\n\nMolango added: ‘When I look at the last international window and I see (Jude) Bellingham out, Lamine Yamal out on the one side, Lucy Bronze out. Is this the football we want to see? Because frankly, people didn't want to spend money just to watch someone like me play.’"

            "content": "The Premier League is launching a direct streaming service in Asia in a move which could have seismic consequences for the long-term future of football broadcasting.\n\nSingapore will be the first country to experience a direct-to-consumer service called Premier League Plus next season, skipping the need for traditional broadcasters.\n\nIt marks a watershed moment and, if ever replicated in the United Kingdom, it would deal a major blow to live action right holders Sky Sports and TNT Sports.\n\nHowever, at this stage it is a mere trial in one of the league's smaller markets and Daily Mail Sport understands it is extremely unlikely that it will be rolled out in the UK or United States. Sky Sports have been a major profit generator and instrumental to the league's popularity since 1992.\n\nFans will watch keenly for the pricing of the streaming service due to the spiralling costs of subscribing to several networks.\n\nSupporters in the UK will have to fork out £1,350 per year from 2027 if they subscribe to all the broadcasters of Premier League and Champions League football.\n\nThe Premier League is launching a direct-to-consumer streaming platform next season\n\nSingapore will become the first country to experience the platform, skipping the need for traditional broadcasters\n\n'For the first time, we’re going direct-to-consumer in Singapore,' said the Premier League's chief executive Richard Masters at the Financial Times’ Business of Football Summit in London.\n\n'It’s a very long, considered process, carefully chosen. We have a six-year agreement with StarHub, one of the two providers out there.\n\n'So from next season onwards, Premier League Plus – rather than Premflix – finally, it’s going to happen.\n\n'It will be a new app that you can download on your smart TV or laptop. You’ll be able to watch 380 games a season, with lots of shoulder content and a 24/7 dedicated channel.\n\n'Will it be replicable elsewhere? That’s what we’re going to find out.'\n\nMasters first admitted in 2020 that the Premier League were working on a Netflix-style digital streaming channel dubbed 'PremFlix', selling live games direct to fans.\n\nThe expectation is that a single streaming service would be more affordable for fans than the full gamut of broadcast subscriptions.\n\nIt feels inevitable that if the model is a success in Singapore, then the Premier League will look at rolling out Premier League Plus more widely; Masters admitted last year that the football broadcasting world must change.\n\nBut selling the rights market-by-market to different broadcasters around the world has been an incredibly gainful enterprise for the league.\n\nThe domestic rights deal between 2025 and 2029 with Sky Sports and TNT Sports is valued at £6.7billion.\n\nKeep in mind that Sky and TNT also take care of their own marketing, production costs, and dealing with customers, all factors which are expensive.\n\nFans in the United Kingdom will be paying around £1,350 if they want access to every broadcaster from 2027\n\nThe Premier League's chief executive Richard Masters hinted that if could be rolled out further if it proves a success in Singapore\n\nThe Premier League will have to take on those responsibilities in Singapore alongside StarHub, a telecommunications provider.\n\nSky Sports and TNT Sports have also built up years of broadcasting expertise, rapport between talent, and an ability to effectively market their work, which has helped the Premier League boom in popularity.\n\nRunning their own broadcasts in-house would be a major risk for the Premier League, and there are also questions about how they would achieve impartial, rigorous journalistic output.\n\nFor example, would the Premier League be willing to air a critical discussion about clubs' owners in the way that a traditional broadcaster might?\n\nMost major leagues work with external broadcasters but in the summer, Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 went onto a subscription channel after their overseeing body, the LFP, failed to secure a rights deal.\n\nThat came after several seasons of declining interest and collapsing income, ending with a five-year deal with DAZN being terminated after one campaign.\n\nThe instability has led to financial problems among many top-flight clubs, but the LFP's Ligue 1+ service has seen initial success, gaining 1.1million subscribers. Eighty per cent of those have paying commitments.\n\nHowever, they are targeting an additional million subscribers by the end of the 2028-29 campaign to meet clubs' financial needs."

            "content": "It's just as well Senne Lammens was wearing an all-yellow kit amid the scrum of red and blue shirts, otherwise there were moments on Monday night when Manchester United’s besieged goalkeeper might have disappeared from view altogether.\n\nWith Everton players crowding around Lammens at set-pieces in search of an equaliser, and United piling in to protect him, the Belgian’s penalty box turned into all-too-familiar scene in the Premier League these days which he likens to a war-zone.\n\nLammens stood strong even though he admitted afterwards having to step behind his goal-line just to get a run-up to punch the ball clear in the face of Everton’s aerial bombardment at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nThe 23-year-old was unflappable and calm under pressure as Michael Carrick’s side moved back into the top four with a 1-0 win, just as he has been since stepping assuredly into United’s starting line-up in October.\n\nIt was arguably his best performance yet, even though curiously there weren’t that many saves to make. ‘Bloody brilliant’ was the verdict of Everton boss David Moyes.\n\nTwo days on and did Lammens have any bruises to show for his heroics?\n\nSenne Lammens was heroic for Man United against Everton on Monday night\n\n‘Not really, no, it's actually been quite alright,’ he says. ‘I mean, physically it was a big battle, a big game, so I'm still recovering from that. But cuts and bruises, not really, no.\n\n‘It’s just the way it is. It’s the Premier League. It’s been like this all season. They always said to me that it was the most physical and that’s the biggest difference. A bit of a war (in the penalty box).\n\n‘It's always been one of my strengths – even in Belgium which is less physical but the principles are all the same – so sometimes I like the challenge as well.\n\n‘Now there are more bodies in front of you, but my team-mates help me out as well blocking the guys away from me. You have to be big and not easily pushed around, so I think that's also important. My physical features are positive for those kind of situations.’\n\nAt 6ft 4in, Lammens isn’t easy to bully, as Everton discovered. After giving his first sit-down interview to the English press at a school on the outskirts of Manchester, he was straight back to Carrington for more gym work and recovery sessions, not leaving the training ground until after 6pm on Wednesday night.\n\n‘The physical demands are quite big, so you're trying to get yourself ready for that,’ he adds. ‘But, naturally, I've always been, how can you say, a bit bigger, with a bit more weight wise. So it's also a positive thing for me the way the Premier League is.\n\n‘I think also that's why Manchester United were interested in me because they knew how it was going to be. To be honest, if it continues like this, just the physicality in general and those corners, I sometimes even like it, I have to say. I enjoy getting out of my comfort zone a little bit and dealing with those situations.\n\n‘Of course it can get too much sometimes. There have to be certain rules. Maybe there are some situations where the goalkeeper could have been protected more.\n\n‘But it’s not that only one team does it. Everyone's trying to get as many goals as they can, so they try new stuff. We do it as well sometimes, making it hard for the goalkeeper. We’ve scored lots of goals from it, so I understand fully why we do it. You just have to deal with it.’\n\nLammens, pictured with his girlfriend Vanessa Herssens, has been superb since signing\n\nLammens has been dealing with it all remarkably well since moving to Old Trafford from Royal Antwerp on deadline day in a deal worth £18.2million, plus £3.5m in add-ons. At that price, he has to be one of the signings of the season.\n\nUnited wanted a replacement for Andre Onana, and Ruben Amorim was known to favour Aston Villa’s No 1 Emi Martinez.\n\nHowever, goalkeeping scout Tony Coton had watched Lammens extensively and pushed for the young Belgian, even though he had only been first-choice at Antwerp for one season and is yet to win a senior cap for his country.\n\nIn fact, Coton argued that Lammens’ inexperience and down-to-earth nature would be a better fit for the United dressing-room than a bigger ego like Martinez.\n\nThe result was that both goalkeepers were kept waiting anxiously on deadline day before Lammens got the green light to board a private jet to Manchester.\n\n‘I had to wait for a little bit, but I trusted in the move and in myself,’ says Lammens. ‘Even if it didn't work out, I wouldn't mind being longer in Antwerp if that give me a better situation. But United was always my No 1 option in my head, and then I was really happy on the last day it came through.\n\n‘I had quite a while contact with United, especially in the end phase. I think Tony Coton was probably one of the biggest ones.\n\n‘I had a good relationship from the beginning. He was always honest and open with me. He gave me a lot of confidence that it was the right step for me, and everything he said has come true.’\n\nLammens had to wait seven games for his debut as Altay Bayindir began the season in goal and the erratic Onana was shipped out on loan to Trabzonspor. From the moment he came into the team against Sunderland, the former Club Brugge keeper has been almost flawless.\n\nA good shot-stopper who is dominant in the air and comfortable kicking with either foot, he was just what United needed and the fans knew it instantly. ‘Are you Schmeichel in disguise?’ they sang on his first appearance at Old Trafford.\n\nLammens with children at a Manchester school, where he gave a first big interview in England\n\n‘The best feeling there was in the beginning,’ he recalls. ‘They gave me even more confidence to keep going and to make the steps I did after that.\n\n‘There wasn't really a clear path for me. I needed a little bit of time to adapt, especially to this league and this quality. So those first weeks were vital.\n\n‘It wasn't really spoken when I was going have my chance, I needed to prove myself in training. But I knew it was going to be there, if it was in the league or in the cups. The way it went was probably ideal for me. I got my chance and I took it, and since then I haven't really looked back. I couldn't really imagine it going any better.\n\n‘I always knew that I was going be ready for it. Every time I've had to be ready to prove myself a little bit, I always did it, so it is just the same thing now again.\n\n‘Pressure is what you make it. I try to just not really think about it too much and relax and then it's not too bad for me, to be honest.\n\n‘You know it's Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, but also you have to look through that a little bit. It's still game of football. The game isn't that much different. Of course the quality is better, you have to trust in yourself. There's a reason I'm here, that I made the move.\n\n‘Sometimes at United, I don't really have a to make a lot of saves. It’s a different kind of goalkeeping, but it's also sometimes the most difficult when there are only one or two saves to be made.\n\n‘But I take a lot of pride in doing the other things well. Maybe not always the box-office stuff or the things people look at first.\n\n‘I take pride in being all-round and not really having any flaws. You don't always have the biggest work to do, but it's staying focused and not giving anything to the opponent – not easy things, at least.\n\n‘I spoke a lot about it with Tom Heaton, who's helping me in my time here as well. He talks about not giving things away and keeping your team in the game. If you want to have a long career, especially in these kind of clubs, they have to count on you and you have to be dependable.’\n\nAdapting to being Manchester United’s No 1 off the pitch has been more of a challenge for the boy from the quiet town of Zottegem in East Flanders who is the antithesis of a football star.\n\nLammens smiles as he remembers emerging from a quiet dinner with his long-time girlfriend Vanessa Herssens at The Ivy in Manchester to be met by flashbulbs.\n\n‘That was one of the more special moments. I mean special, like, I couldn't believe it really. It's not always the best feeling. They weren't too bad, but especially for my girlfriend as well. It was the first time and a pretty strange feeling.\n\n‘They warned me that Manchester United is a different animal, especially social media wise. I mean, it's all positive now, but I know sometimes it can get negative fast so I don't really want to be looking towards it too much.\n\n‘I'm just a normal guy and that is also something I try to show the world. Sometimes there are people who have that mindset and that lifestyle a little bit different than me, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n‘So it's a bit like my character in general and how I want to be seen next to the pitch. I don't only want to be looked at as a football player, but also just a normal person with his own beliefs and stuff to do next to it.’\n\nWhen Daily Mail Sport spoke to Rik De Mil, Lammens youth-team coach at Brugge, he described a humble young man who liked to discuss economics with him. ‘Senne is an atypical football player, not penthouses and Euros,’ said De Mil.\n\nBrian Vandenbussche, his goalkeeper coach at Antwerp, had concerns about Lammens’ laid-back character so he put together motivational videos of the young keeper in action to ‘bring out the fire’ in him.\n\nBoth remember seeing him working out in the gym after midnight, such was his determination to succeed, just as United insiders say he regularly trains on days off and makes detailed notes after sessions.\n\nThen there are the quirky superstitions. Lammens doesn’t like family or friends wishing him luck keeping a clean sheet in case they jinx him, and likes to put his water bottle in a specific place in the goal.\n\nLammens is seen playing football in a sports hall with children in Manchester\n\nBecause of his dedication to the job, however, Lammens doesn’t like to watch football at home and prefers US sports like the NBA.\n\n‘I don't really, to be honest,’ he says. ‘Everything revolves around football on a daily basis, so you want to switch off a little bit mentally.\n\n‘I'm a big sports guy. I love watching other sports and other athletes do their thing, especially how they prepare the game. With the NBA, for example, you can learn a lot from LeBron James.\n\n‘I read quite a lot about other athletes and about mentality. There are lots of good books about dealing with adversity, stress or stuff like that, which can also help you in this kind of industry.’\n\nLammens has been reading Tiger Woods’ autobiography and says his favourite is The Alchemist, a book about a young Spanish boy who dreams of finding treasure in Egypt.\n\nTo promote World Book Day, he was speaking at Partington Central Academy Primary School after surprising the children. The United keeper took part in a Q&A session before joining in some playground games.\n\n‘It’s a bit new for me, but it's also probably one of my best feelings when you get into those classes and see all those children cheering for you with open eyes. They don't believe it,’ says Lammens. ‘Because I also was there once in my life. It's not that long ago.’\n\nThe Manchester United Foundation is hosting a children's book appeal throughout March, encouraging fans to donate new and pre-loved books to children in need. The foundation aims to develop and improve the wellbeing and life skills of children aged 5-11."

            "content": "Retired tennis star Eugenie Bouchard has opened up on the chaos that consumed her life - and prompted a 'rebellious phase' - after bursting onto the scene when she made the 2014 Wimbledon final at the tender age of 20.\n\nThe former player retired at the Canadian Open last summer at the age of 31, and has since transitioned to playing pickleball professionally, after calling time on a 16-year career that saw her reach the semi-finals at the Australian Open and Roland-Garros.\n\nBut the high watermark of Bouchard's career came at the beginning of her travails on the WTA Tour, when she played her Wimbledon final against Petra Kvitova in only her second run-out in SW19.\n\nBouchard ultimately lost out to the Czech star but was catapulted into a new realm of fame in the wake of her breakout run.\n\n'After that final, my life became chaotic: media attention, sponsors, changes on every level,' she told the Tennis Insider Club. 'Everything around my changed, which didn't help short-term, plus the weight of expectations.\n\n'Before, winning was amazing and losing normal - now winning was expected, losing a catastrophe. Anything short of a final was failure.'\n\nEugenie Bouchard has opened up on the chaos she felt overwhelmed her after her breakout 2014 Wimbledon run\n\nAlthough ultimately losing to Petra Kvitova, the 20-year-old was thrust into the spotlight\n\nWhile the afterglow of making the final and gaining a career-high ranking of world No 5 sustained her for some time, Bouchard went on to admit that the sky-high expectations the achievement had set took a toll on her mental health in the years which followed.\n\n'After an excellent 2014, 2015 was very difficult for me,' she continued. 'It was tough because mental health wasn't discussed like it is today, and back then I was suffering a lot - I simply didn't dare talk about it.\n\n'Even admitting you saw a therapist was strange. People thought you were crazy or weak. I'm happy it's become a completely normal topic, glad things have changed, but I went through a very difficult period and couldn't talk about it.'\n\nIncreased scrutiny on her form led to Bouchard looking to express herself in different ways, with the Montreal-born star admitting that she tested her rebellious streak by shaving an under-cut into her hairstyle.\n\n'To be fair, I wanted a very small under-cut thing,' she said on the Ok Sweetie podcast. 'I don't know what happened, but it was literally half my head.\n\n'I feel like I look like a cancer patient. I was like, \"This is not the look I was going for\". It was way worse than I intended, but it caused me not to get my Rolex deal renewed.'\n\nBouchard adopted the style while enjoying some downtime in Miami following her second-round exit at the 2016 Australian Open, but the stylistic folly is alleged to have come with long-term consequences.\n\nShe went on to claim that Rolex had emailed her agent to suggest that the new look 'did not align' with the storied watchmakers' public image.\n\nBouchard was ranked No 1 by SportsPro in their 'World's 50 Most Marketable Athletes' list in the year after her Wimbledon success, and was frequently featured in publications outside of the tennis-specific sphere, even taking part in a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition.\n\nSince taking a step back from tennis and switching to pickleball, she has continued to maintain a strong following on Instagram, with over 2.3million followers to her name.\n\nJoin the debate Should sponsors have the right to drop athletes over their personal style choices?\n\nOne of her phases of rebelling against the standards of the tennis world involved shaving part of her head\n\nThe Canadian former professional also admitted that she had found being pigeon-holed for her looks challenging during her playing career\n\nBut Bouchard was keen to stress that she felt like at times she had been pigeon-holed for her looks during her playing career.\n\n'I don't want to be just painted with a broad stroke of, \"OK, that's all she is\",' she continued. 'There are layers and layers and layers.\n\n'Sometimes I just feel like people would label me as \"OK, she just likes to post this on Instagram or something\"… there's so much more to me than that.\n\n'That's not what I think about 24/7. It's a portion of my personality.\n\n'Just assuming someone is only surface-level, or what they show, that's just the feeling I've gotten sometimes.'"

At the minute, everything is good with him and they seem very happy.”\n\n‌\n\n\n\nInothewayurthinkin is seventh in the betting for the Gold Cup with Jango Baie currently the 9-2 favourite with William Hill of those entered.\n\nFact To File is actually shorter at 4-1 but he still needs to be supplemented for the race and may opt for the Ryanair Chase instead.\n\nThe Jukebox Man and Gaelic Warrior are both 11-2 although there is also a possibility that the latter may go for the Ryanair.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nGalopin Des Champs has drifted out to 7-1 with Haiti Couleurs at 8-1."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nLet's not waste any time here with some fancy introduction, where we evoke the pastoral sights of spring training or the loud crack of a perfectly struck ball during batting practice in a near-empty ballpark. No, let's cut right to the issue at hand: It's time for our annual way-too-early All-Star selections, in which we predict who will be making the trip to Philadelphia for the 2026 Midsummer Classic in 138 days (but who's counting).\n\nAs always, we'll fill out the 32-man rosters with 20 position players and 12 pitchers, including three relievers, with each team receiving at least one representative.\n\nAmerican League starters\n\nC: Cal Raleigh, Seattle Mariners\n\nWhat will Raleigh do for an encore after his historic 60-homer season? Here's one way to look at it: 34 players have hit at least 50 home runs in a season, with 23 of those doing it just once. Let's assume Raleigh's true talent level isn't hitting 60 home runs, or even 50, but something less. We don't know that yet, but you probably don't want to bet on a 50-homer season.\n\nRaleigh's difference of 26 home runs to his second-highest season total currently ranks tied for the biggest among those 23 players:\n\nRaleigh: 26 (60 in 2026 to 34 in 2025)\n\nLuis Gonzalez: 26 (57 to 31)\n\nBrady Anderson: 26 (50 to 24)\n\nBarry Bonds: 24 (73 to 49)\n\nRoger Maris: 22 (61 to 39)\n\nWhile those are the five biggest gaps, the average among the 23 players is 12.7 home runs, so if we use that for Raleigh, we get 47 home runs. That feels attainable, especially if he carries a big workload again like he did in 2025, when he played 159 games between catcher and DH.\n\n1B: Nick Kurtz, Athletics\n\nKurtz over Vladimir Guerrero Jr.? A tough call for sure, but I just can't ignore Kurtz's rookie slash line: .290/.383/.619, with 36 home runs in 117 games. You don't luck your way into numbers like that -- and he did that after playing a grand total of 33 games in the minors. After getting called up in late April, it's not like the league ever really figured him out either, as July and August were his best months.\n\nKurtz did tail off a bit in September when he hit .221 with a .309 OBP -- although he still hit nine home runs and slugged .570 -- and struggled against southpaws (.197, .685 OPS) all season, but that's no surprise given his limited at-bats against good left-handers in college and the minors. In Dan Szymborski's 2026 simulations, the 80th-percentile outcome for Kurtz is posting a .291/.379/.571 slash line and that's realistic, with the possibility of matching what he did in 2025 if he improves against lefties.\n\n2B: Jazz Chisholm Jr., New York Yankees\n\nGleyber Torres started last year's All-Star Game, but don't bet on that again. After slumping in the second half, he might not even hold the job all season with rookies Kevin McGonigle and Max Anderson hot to take a spot in the Detroit infield.\n\nChisholm is the best of a weak group of AL candidates, with Marcus Semien, Jorge Polanco and Brandon Lowe all going to the National League this offseason. Jose Altuve might win the fan vote and can still hit, but his poor defense craters his value.\n\n3B: Jose Ramirez, Cleveland Guardians\n\nRamirez finished third in the AL MVP voting -- his eighth career top-10 finish. He's now the all-time leader in MVP award shares among players who have never won the award. Ramirez hasn't really deserved an MVP award in any of those seasons -- his highest ranking among AL position players in WAR was third in 2018 and 2021 and he was sixth in 2025 -- but his voting results are a testament to his consistency and the appreciation of his all-around game. He should get some competition from Junior Caminero and Maikel Garcia, but for now he remains the top candidate at the position as he enters his age-33 season.\n\nSS: Bobby Witt Jr., Kansas City Royals\n\nA year ago, this was a good debate between Witt and Gunnar Henderson after they finished second and fourth in the 2024 AL MVP voting after both posted ridiculous 9-WAR seasons. Witt has pulled ahead since.\n\nHenderson injured his side in spring training last season, got off to a slow start and went from hitting 37 home runs to just 17 while Witt had another excellent campaign, finishing fourth in the MVP vote. The biggest difference between the two is now on defense, where Witt has matured into perhaps the best shortstop in the game, winning back-to-back Gold Gloves, while Henderson's metrics took a hit last season to where he ranked below average.\n\nOF: Aaron Judge, New York Yankees\n\nThe easiest call on the board, coming off another MVP and another historic offensive season (.331/.457/.688, 53 home runs, 9.7 WAR). With three MVP awards, Judge is looking to join Barry Bonds and Shohei Ohtani as the only players to win more than three and he enters 2026 as a huge favorite to do that. Judge turns 34 in April, but just won his first batting title, crossed 50 home runs for a record-tying fourth time and is making a run at one of the greatest five-year stretches we've ever seen.\n\nOF: Julio Rodriguez, Seattle Mariners\n\nJ-Rod's value is due more to his all-around game than a batting line that jumps out at you, but he still went 30/30 for the second time last season while hitting .267/.324/.474 with superb defense in center field. Put him in a different home park and those numbers would look more impressive: He hit .236/.306/.369 at home compared to .296/.341/.571 on the road.\n\nRanking MLB's best at every position As a new baseball season approaches, Buster Olney compares the elite at every spot on the diamond. Top 10s for 2026 »\n\nOF: Roman Anthony, Boston Red Sox\n\nYes, he's this good. We saw flashes of his future All-Star potential as a rookie, as he hit .292/.396/.463 in 71 games. That on-base percentage would have finished tied with Juan Soto for third-highest in the majors if he had enough plate appearances. Anthony's power started to show up in August, when he hit .304 with six home runs as he started lifting the ball more, before he missed September with an oblique strain. Look for a .400 OBP, 25 home runs and a top-10 MVP finish as a sophomore.\n\nDH: Yordan Alvarez, Houston Astros\n\nA hand injury and severe ankle sprain limited Alvarez to 48 games in 2025, but don't forget him when drafting your fantasy team. From 2022 to 2024, only Judge had a higher OPS+ and Alvarez will still be just 28 years old on Opening Day. He should return to his status as one of the top hitters in the game -- maybe top three alongside Judge and Ohtani.\n\nSP: Tarik Skubal, Detroit Tigers\n\nSkubal, Garrett Crochet and Hunter Brown separated themselves from the pack of AL starters in 2025 and I would rank them 1-2-3 heading into 2026 with a gap to the next tier.\n\nMax Fried should once again win a lot of games. Jacob deGrom had a nice comeback season, but Globe Life Field played as such an extreme pitcher's park and deGrom still allowed 26 home runs. His road ERA was 3.65 compared to 2.35 at home, so he's not quite in the top echelon. The same analysis applies to Mariners starters Bryan Woo and Logan Gilbert, who benefit from a friendly home park.\n\nThe wild card is Baltimore's Trevor Rogers, who had a 1.81 ERA in 18 starts and ranked fourth in WAR. He's not that good, of course, but don't discount his chance of being a top-10 starter in the league.\n\nAmerican League reserves\n\nC: Shea Langeliers, Athletics\n\n1B: Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Toronto Blue Jays\n\n1B: Munetaka Murakami ,Chicago White Sox\n\n2B: Luke Keaschall, Minnesota Twins\n\n3B: Junior Caminero, Tampa Bay Rays\n\nSS: Gunnar Henderson, Baltimore Orioles\n\nSS: Zach Neto, Los Angeles Angels\n\nOF: Wyatt Langford, Texas Rangers\n\nOF: Byron Buxton, Minnesota Twins\n\nOF: Jarren Duran, Boston Red Sox\n\nDH: Brent Rooker, Athletics\n\nThe most difficult position here is shortstop, which is stacked. I had to leave off Jeremy Pena, Corey Seager and Jacob Wilson, last year's starter, with Neto appearing as the Angels' lone representative. He's a valid All-Star, however, with 5.1 WAR each of the past two seasons, combining good power with plus defense.\n\nLangeliers quietly hit .277/.325/.536 with 31 home runs and it wasn't a Sacramento thing as he hit better on the road. He gets the nod over Alejandro Kirk. Murakami is a boom-or-bust type and is my White Sox rep, knocking Pete Alonso off the roster. Keaschall can really hit but must stay healthy. He had wrist surgery in 2023, Tommy John surgery in 2024 and missed time with a fractured forearm and then a torn thumb ligament as a rookie in 2025.\n\nBuxton gets the nod for now ... assuming the Twins don't trade him. Duran was a stud in 2024 (8.7 WAR) and still very good in 2025 (4.7 WAR). George Springer had a monster year in 2025 but that will be difficult to repeat at 36, so we'll go with Rooker at DH (the A's have a fun lineup, don't they?).\n\nAmerican League pitchers\n\nSP: Garrett Crochet, Boston Red Sox\n\nSP: Hunter Brown, Houston Astros\n\nSP: Max Fried, New York Yankees\n\nSP: Dylan Cease, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nSP: Logan Gilbert, Seattle Mariners\n\nStat that will define 2026 for every MLB team Here are the numbers that could make -- or break -- your favorite squad in the new year.\n\nNational League » | American League »\n\nSP: Nathan Eovaldi, Texas Rangers\n\nSP: Cole Ragans, Kansas City Royals\n\nSP: Trevor Rogers, Baltimore Orioles\n\nRP: Aroldis Chapman, Boston Red Sox\n\nRP: Cade Smith, Cleveland Guardians\n\nRP: Andres Muñoz, Seattle Mariners\n\nSo many good pitchers left off here: Bryan Woo, Jacob deGrom, Framber Valdez, Kevin Gausman, Rookie of the Year contender Trey Yesavage and Cam Schlittler, who was just as impressive as Yesavage last fall.\n\nI like Cease's chances of having a big year, after joining the Blue Jays with their terrific defense behind him. Gilbert gets the nod over his teammate Woo because of a much higher strikeout rate last year, which makes him the better bet for 2026. Ragans was an All-Star in 2024, missed a bunch of time in 2025, but struck out 98 in 61.2 innings and finished the year healthy. Chapman is coming off one of the most unhittable relief seasons of all time, Smith is one of the top strikeout relievers and Muñoz works around a few too many walks by limiting both hits and home runs.\n\nNational League starters\n\nAP Photo/Kayla Wolf, File\n\nC: William Contreras, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nThis is a deeper position than you might realize. Contreras, after finishing fifth in the 2024 NL MVP voting, played through a fractured middle finger all of last season and saw his offensive numbers dip a bit. Will Smith is a three-time All-Star. Hunter Goodman hit 31 home runs for the Rockies. Drake Baldwin is an up-and-coming bat-first catcher who had an outstanding rookie season and then you have defensive specialists like Patrick Bailey and Gabriel Moreno.\n\nWe'll go with Contreras, who should see a rebound in his power numbers, has turned into a solid defensive catcher, and might play 150 games again, starting at DH when he doesn't catch.\n\n1B: Matt Olson, Atlanta Braves\n\nThere are four strong candidates here with Olson, Freddie Freeman, Bryce Harper and the overlooked Michael Busch. Harper is out to prove to Dave Dombrowski that he's still an elite player, but he doesn't need any extra motivation. Freeman is still great, but since 2023 his WAR has dropped from 6.8 to 4.7 to 3.5. Busch hit 34 home runs on his way to posting 4.6 WAR in 2025. But Olson gets the nod. He's younger than Harper and Freeman and had the best all-around season of this group a year ago (6.0 WAR). He's also riding a streak of four straight seasons with 162 games played, so you know he'll post every day.\n\n2B: Nico Hoerner, Chicago Cubs\n\nKetel Marte is the default pick at second base because of his .913 OPS over the past two seasons, the sixth-best mark in the majors. Hoerner is a much different player than Marte, getting much of his value from his glove and legs, but he also hit .297 with a .345 OBP and topped Marte in WAR in 2025 (6.2 to 4.4). Durability is a key, as Hoerner has topped 150 games three straight years while Marte has averaged 137 games over those three seasons.\n\n3B: Alex Bregman, Chicago Cubs\n\nThere are several candidates here besides Bregman, including Manny Machado, Bo Bichette, Austin Riley, Matt Chapman and Max Muncy, but they all come with warts, whether it's injury risk, age or, in Bichette's case, a new position.\n\nBregman has been a consistent two-way performer and was on his way to another four-win season with the Red Sox in 2025 if not for a quad strain. He and Machado are similar at this point: Machado has averaged 3.3 WAR the past three seasons with a 117 OPS+ while Bregman is at 4.2 and 121, both now in their early 30s. Riley might have the most upside here but has battled injuries the past two seasons, so I'm going with Bregman, who I think has a big year ahead at Wrigley Field.\n\nSS: Geraldo Perdomo, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nFinal MLB offseason grades for all 30 teams Three A's, a whole lot of B's and one F -- but who got them? Let's hand out offseason report cards. David Schoenfield »\n\nJust like in the AL, this is a loaded position in the NL: Francisco Lindor, Mookie Betts, Trea Turner, Elly De La Cruz, Dansby Swanson. All would be worthy selections, but going with Perdomo is confirmation in my belief that his 2025 season -- .290/.389/.462, 100 RBIs, 7.0 WAR, fourth in MVP voting -- is the real deal. He combines elite plate discipline with a high contact rate, finishing with more walks than strikeouts, to produce a high OBP with improved power (58 extra-base hits) and plus defense.\n\nOF: Juan Soto, New York Mets\n\nSoto's final numbers in 2025 -- .263/.396/.525 with 43 home runs -- were good enough for third place in the NL MVP voting. The biggest shocker was going 38 for 42 on stolen-base attempts, which tied for the NL lead and certainly makes him the slowest stolen-base leader in MLB history. (He ranked in just the 13th percentile in speed.) According to Statcast metrics, he even hit into some bad luck, with projected numbers of .288 with a .608 slugging. Look for even better numbers in 2026. It will be difficult to unseat Ohtani in MVP voting with the Dodgers superstar slated to pitch a full season, but if the Mets win the NL East and Soto's numbers tick up a bit, maybe he wins MVP for the first time.\n\nOF: Kyle Tucker, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nWhen healthy, Tucker has been one of the best players in the majors the past two seasons, producing 4.7 WAR in just 78 games in 2024, when he fractured his shin on a foul ball, and then ranking among the leaders in 2025 until he fractured his hand, which he played through leading to a prolonged slump.\n\nWhile going to the Dodgers, where he'll be just another guy in their star-studded clubhouse, will help keep the attention off him, his high salary -- calculated at $57 million average annual value -- creates a different level of pressure for Tucker. If he handles that, he'll earn his fifth straight All-Star selection.\n\nOF: Ronald Acuña Jr., Atlanta Braves\n\nAcuña's career has been a bunch of stops and starts, with the impact of ACL tears in both knees lined up against two 40-homer seasons, his majestic MVP season of 2023, and awe-inspiring displays of power.\n\nHe played 90 games in 2025 and was superb: .290/.417/.518. He'll probably never repeat 2023, when his strikeout rate dipped to a level he hasn't otherwise approached in his career, but if he can stay on the field he should be one of the best hitters in the league.\n\nDH: Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nLet's see, a few statistical feats Ohtani can accomplish in 2026:\n\nA third straight 50-homer season. Only five other players have at least three 50-homer seasons in their careers.\n\nLead his league in slugging percentage, OPS, OPS+ and total bases for the fourth straight year.\n\nLead in runs scored for the third straight year. His 280 runs over the past two years were the most in a two-year span since Jeff Bagwell scored 295 in 1999-2000.\n\nA fourth straight MVP and fifth for his career.\n\nOh, and he pitches on the side. He continues to amaze and captivate us in impossible ways.\n\nSP: Paul Skenes, Pittsburgh Pirates\n\nMLB's top 5 breakout teams for 2026 Which teams are about to get a whole lot better? We break down five potential breakouts.\n\nBradford Doolittle »\n\nSkenes' strikeout rate dropped from 33.1% as a rookie to 29.5% last season. Normally, that might be a slight cause for concern, but that rate still ranked eighth among pitchers with at least 100 innings and it's not like it led to more damage against him.\n\nStatcast classifies Skenes as throwing seven different pitchers, including using five of them at least 10% of the time. He deployed his curveball, his least used pitch, 4.8% (about four pitches a game). I don't know if he needs all those pitches, but it seems to be working just fine.\n\nLet's see if the Pirates cut Skenes loose a little more this year: He made just 11 starts on four days of rest and topped 100 pitches just eight times, so he finished with 187 innings. He should get to 200-plus innings in 2026.\n\nNational League reserves\n\nC: Will Smith, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nC: Hunter Goodman, Colorado Rockies\n\n1B: Michael Busch, Chicago Cubs\n\n2B: Ketel Marte, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\n3B: Manny Machado, San Diego Padres\n\nSS: Mookie Betts, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nSS: Masyn Winn, St. Louis Cardinals\n\nOF: Fernando Tatis Jr., San Diego Padres\n\nOF: Corbin Carroll, Arizona Diamondbacks\n\nOF: James Wood, Washington Nationals\n\nDH: Kyle Schwarber, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nThe problem with the NL is I ended up with nobody from the Rockies, Cardinals or Marlins in my first cut, and generously included Wood as the third outfielder only to give the Nationals a representative. There's a good chance we end up with some dubious All-Stars from those clubs. Goodman made it last year -- and earned it, hitting 31 home runs -- and is the logical choice to represent the Rockies again.\n\nI went with Busch over Freeman and Harper, going with the younger player. Shortstop is impossible. Never bet against Betts and I think his offense bounces back after a stomach virus sapped his strength early last year. Winn isn't one of the top six shortstops, but he did win a Gold Glove -- plus someone has to represent the Cardinals. Tatis and Carroll (assuming he's OK after his hamate injury this spring) are easy picks as outfield backups, especially with Pete Crow-Armstrong's slide in the second half raising questions about whether he can repeat his offensive output. We'll see if Schwarber can repeat his monster 56-homer season.\n\nNational League pitchers\n\nSP: Cristopher Sanchez, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nSP: Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nSP: Hunter Greene, Cincinnati Reds\n\nSP: Logan Webb, San Francisco Giants\n\nSP: Nolan McLean, New York Mets\n\nSP: Chris Sale, Atlanta Braves\n\nSP: Jacob Misiorowski, Milwaukee Brewers\n\nSP: Eury Perez, Miami Marlins\n\nRP: Mason Miller, San Diego Padres\n\nRP: Jhoan Duran, Philadelphia Phillies\n\nRP: Edwin Diaz, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nESPN is now the home of MLB.TV All MLB out-of-market games. Live or On Demand. All in one place. Get access\n\nSanchez finished second to Skenes in the NL Cy Young voting and deserved it -- in fact, he was slightly ahead of Skenes in Baseball-Reference + FanGraphs WAR (although Skenes was the unanimous Cy Young winner). Greene is going to make 30 starts one of these years and that will make him a Cy Young contender. Webb is our only Giants rep but also makes it on merit. He increased his strikeout rate in 2025 and with five straight excellent seasons is one of the safest bets among starting pitchers.\n\nMcLean is still a rookie but looked so polished in his eight starts that I'm taking him instead of new Mets teammate Freddy Peralta. Sale just has to stay healthy. He won Cy Young honors in 2024 and is a good sleeper pick to win again as he was just as dominant in 2025 until he fractured his ribcage diving for a ball.\n\nMisiorowski was a controversial All-Star last year, a late addition to the squad after making just five career starts. If he can improve his control, he'll earn that selection this year. Perez made it back from Tommy John surgery after missing 2024 and is still just 23 with huge upside.\n\nThe relievers? No controversy with those three choices, with apologies to Abner Uribe for not finding a spot for him."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nSpring training camps are underway, which means it is time to look at the state of baseball. As part of our 2026 MLB season preview, ESPN's Buster Olney surveyed those around the industry to help him rank the top 10 players at every position as part of his annual positional ranking series.\n\nToday, we rank the best of the best in center field.\n\nThe objective of this exercise is to identify the best players for the 2026 season, not who might be best in five years or over their career. We will roll out a position per day over the next two weeks. Here's the rest of the schedule: starting pitchers (Feb. 16), relief pitchers (Feb. 17), catchers (Feb. 18), first basemen (Feb. 19), second basemen (Feb. 20), third basemen (Monday), shortstops (Tuesday), corner outfielders (Wednesday), designated hitters (Friday).\n\nByron Buxton is coming off his healthiest season -- and perhaps best -- since 2017 and is entrenched among our top 10 center fielders -- yet the 32-year-old is caught in a weird baseball purgatory, which could be referred to as life with the Minnesota Twins.\n\nThe Twins have slashed their payroll by about 35% over the past three years, down to $106 million, after unloading a small army of players at the trade deadline in 2025 en route to a 92-loss season. Tom Pohlad has now become the controlling owner of the Twins, and recently delivered the organization's new messaging: He wants to win this year.\n\nAs with all new owners, there seems to be a learning curve in effect for Pohlad. As this past offseason began, industry members expected Minnesota to continue last summer's teardown and deal Joe Ryan and perhaps Buxton, following the deep budget cuts. But early in the winter, the team effectively pulled Ryan out of trade consideration, around the incongruent thought that it aimed to contend this year. Then, mere weeks away from the start of spring training, Derek Falvey, the head of baseball operations for Minnesota, departed the organization over philosophical differences.\n\nTypically, a franchise going through this steep transition would trade a player like Buxton, who is owed about $50 million over the next three years. But Buxton has a no-trade clause, and what he has heard from Pohlad is that the Twins are going to try to win. If Buxton remains, he's likely to go through the best part of his career watching others compete in October.\n\nBut minds can be changed. If the roster reality manifests this summer -- ahead of what might be a costly labor situation when the current CBA expires in the winter -- Pohlad could try to move Buxton's contract, and Buxton could reverse course, ask to be moved to a contender and waive his no-trade clause. He has noted that, while he says he wants to stay, the people in power within the Twins' organization haven't flatly and loudly said that Buxton won't be dealt.\n\n\"All it takes is for somebody at the top to go to the media -- 'We're not trading you,'\" Buxton told The Athletic (and others) after arriving at the Twins' spring training camp. \"Trade rumors stop.\"\n\nUntil that happens, Buxton will continue to drift into an uncertain future, as one of MLB's best center fielders. Here are the top 10.\n\nTop 10 center fielders\n\n1. Julio Rodriguez, Seattle Mariners\n\nHe just turned 25 years old, and he seems on the verge of evolving from a star to something more than that. Rodriguez had an OPS of .900 after the All-Star break last season, slugging .560 while hitting 18 of his 32 homers in that span. He still seems to be learning, as many young players do, how to adjust to the waves of opposing pitchers that work through games in this era. He fared very well against starting pitchers last year, generating an .858 OPS, but didn't have nearly as much success against relievers, posting a .701 OPS with six homers in 277 plate appearances.\n\n2. Pete Crow-Armstrong, Chicago Cubs\n\nHis monthly offensive performance last season ranged from a nearly 1.000 OPS (.984 in July) to under .500 (.446 in August), but all the while, he was a plus-plus defender and baserunner who accumulated 72 extra-base hits (including 31 homers), 35 steals, 91 runs and 6.0 WAR. Cubs manager Craig Counsell suggested last season that PCA might be the best overall defender in baseball, and while Ceddanne Rafaela, Patrick Bailey and Bobby Witt Jr. each might have some claim to that title, Crow-Armstrong's impact for his pitchers is undeniable. PCA's acute splits vs. lefties and righties are a concern:\n\nVs. right-handers: .271/.315/.523\n\nVs. lefties: .188/.217/.372\n\n3. Daulton Varsho, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nIn the 71 games he played during the 2025 regular season, Varsho had 35 extra-base hits, including 20 homers, and a career-best OPS+ of 122. He continues to be one of the best defenders at this position; if PCA's strength is gliding into the gaps, Varsho seems to excel in retreating to the warning track and making plays around the wall.\n\nRanking MLB's best at every position As a new baseball season approaches, Buster Olney compares the elite at every spot on the diamond. Top 10s for 2026 »\n\n4. Byron Buxton, Minnesota Twins\n\nHe destroyed left-handed pitching last year, blasting a .676 slugging percentage in 123 plate appearances. Both his success and his struggles were reflected in the Twins' wins and losses: Buxton hit .332/.396/.692 in Twins' victories last year but just .213/.272/.444 in the losses in which he played. Of his 126 games last year, he played 118 in center field.\n\n5. Jackson Merrill, San Diego Padres\n\nMerrill was on the injured list three different times last season, fighting hamstring, concussion and ankle issues in his second year in the big leagues -- and yet he still managed to post decent numbers. He had a .774 OPS and an adjusted OPS of 112, compiling 47 extra-base hits and scoring 59 runs in 117 games. With a full, healthy year, he might well challenge Rodriguez for the No. 1 spot on this list next year.\n\n6. Ceddanne Rafaela, Boston Red Sox\n\nHis tendency to swing aggressively -- even recklessly, at times -- can sometimes overshadow just how good of a player he can be. Rafaela had a strikeout-to-walk ratio of about 4-to-1 last season, for an on-base percentage of .295, but he's got power (54 extra-base hits) and speed (20 stolen bases). He plays center field in Fenway Park fearlessly, which is why he could reasonably be in the conversation for best defender in the game.\n\n7. Trent Grisham, New York Yankees\n\nIt's kind of surprising over how much debate there was about whether the Yankees would extend a qualifying offer to Grisham, since he was a good player for them last season -- 3.5 WAR, good power, an adjusted OPS of 125, decent defense. And as the old saying goes, there's no such thing as a bad one-year contract, especially for big-money teams like the Yankees. Manager Aaron Boone will probably protect Grisham from left-handed pitching, against which he hit .182 last season. And if you assumed his gaudy 2025 power numbers were manufactured at Yankee Stadium, you'd be wrong: 22 of his 35 homers were hit on the road.\n\n8. Michael Harris II, Atlanta Braves\n\nThe trajectory of his production is not what he wants:\n\nFinal MLB offseason grades for all 30 teams Three A's, a whole lot of B's and one F -- but who got them? Let's hand out offseason report cards. David Schoenfield »\n\n2022: 5.1 WAR\n\n2023: 3.5 WAR\n\n2024: 3.2 WAR\n\n2025: 2.2 WAR\n\nHarris is about to turn 25 years old, so this feels like an important year for him to stabilize, which probably will require a little more plate discipline. Last year, he had 16 walks and 128 strikeouts -- a 0.13 walk-to-strikeout ratio, the worst among the 145 hitters who qualified for the batting title. He continues to field well, ranking seventh among center fielders in defensive runs saved and outs above average.\n\n9. Luis Robert Jr., New York Mets\n\nThe Mets' bet on Robert might be the most telling barometer of the team's season: They believe in his upside, which we saw in 2023, when he mashed 38 homers and stole 20 bases. But that was the only season -- in a career that began in 2020 -- when Robert played in more than 110 games. Last year, Robert struggled against power pitchers (as defined by Baseball Reference), batting .193 with a .337 slugging percentage.\n\n10. Andy Pages, Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nPages was on his way to a really great season, batting .280 with 19 homers through Aug. 12, but he struggled down the stretch and into the postseason, so the Dodgers will be looking for him to bounce back early in the season.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nColton Cowser, Baltimore Orioles: He mustered 3.1 WAR in 153 games in 2024, hitting 24 homers, but injuries took him off the field last year.\n\nJake Meyers, Houston Astros: Meyers was really good at getting on base last year, with a .354 OBP and16 stolen bases.\n\nTJ Friedl, Cincinnati Reds: He generated an above league-average OPS+ of 106 over 152 games.\n\nCedric Mullins, Tampa Bay Rays: He never seemed comfortable after being traded from the Orioles to the Mets last season. He quickly re-signed to play in the AL East and could be back on the market next offseason.\n\nJakob Marsee, Miami Marlins: Called up at the beginning of August, Marsee put in two impressive months, generating an OPS+ of 132, hitting 18 doubles and five homers in 234 plate appearances and stealing 14 bases. Paul Hembekides dug into the underlying numbers and offered these concerns: \"He had a .357 BABIP in the majors and .297 in the minors, so he had extreme batted-ball luck. PECOTA projects a .235/.324/.374 line this year.\"\n\nBrenton Doyle, Colorado Rockies: With a new front office in place in Colorado, this could be a crossroads year for Doyle, a strong defender who really struggled at the plate last year with an OPS+ of 72.\n\nSal Frelick, Milwaukee Brewers: Jackson Chourio played the most games in center field for Milwaukee, but Frelick had some games out there as well, and we wanted Frelick somewhere in the top 10s. He was a 3-WAR player last year, with another solid season of getting on base (over 200 times) and some power and speed.\n\nNathan Lukes, Toronto Blue Jays: As with Frelick, it just seems as if Lukes, who played center field some last year when Varsho was hurt, deserves a mention on one of these lists.\n\nOneil Cruz, Pittsburgh Pirates: It's a pivotal year for him, as he nears his second swing through arbitration. He played in 135 games last year and mustered 0.3 WAR, batting .200/.298/.378."

            "content": "Stephen A. Smith says Steelers GM Omar Khan needs to find a quarterback rather than waiting on Aaron Rodgers. (2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first overall in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second overall in 2026, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\nRegarding the Dolphins, the NFLPA survey wrote: \"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL.'\"\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished in last place, for the first time in the four-year history of the union's surveys. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year following a grievance filed by the NFL, which claimed the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards, even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment. An NFL spokesperson also declined to the comment, saying that like the last four years of the NFLPA's report cards, the league had no knowledge of the survey.\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A+ to F- on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and surveys were conducted from Nov. 2, 2025, to Dec. 11, 2025.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" the survey said.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" the survey said. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers training room lacks updated recovery technology and modalities. Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, while the training staff ranks first in the NFL.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth overall in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami head coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A+ to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, in 2025, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the surveys. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nBrady Tkachuk, the Ottawa Senators captain and a Team USA gold medalist, said he didn't appreciate the AI-doctored video released by the White House that made it appear he was disparaging Canadians.\n\nThe video, published Sunday by the White House's official TikTok account, featured doctored footage from a Tkachuk brothers' news conference at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. While \"Free Bird,\" the goal song for Team USA, played in the background of the video, Brady Tkachuk was made to say, \"They booed our national anthem, so I had to come out and teach those maple syrup eating f---s a lesson.\"\n\nThe clip, which discloses that it used AI-generated media, has 11.1 million views on TikTok and has been widely viewed on other social media platforms.\n\n\"Well, it's clearly fake, because it's not my voice, not my lips moving,\" Tkachuk said Thursday in his first media availability in Ottawa since the U.S. defeated Canada for the gold medal in men's Olympic ice hockey in Milan. \"I'm not in control of any of those accounts. I know that those words would never come out of my mouth. So, I can't do anything about it.\"\n\nTkachuk was asked if he enjoyed the video.\n\n\"It's not my voice. It's not what I was saying,\" he said. \"I would never say that. That's not who I am, so I guess I don't like that video because that would never come out of my mouth, and never had that thought.\"\n\nTkachuk also addressed what he didn't say during Team USA's locker room celebration. Some on social media accused Tkachuk of being the person who shouted, \"Close the northern border!\" during Team USA's congratulatory call with President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I've been seeing stuff that people think it's me. But if you watch the video, it's not my voice or something that I never say,\" Tkachuk said. \"I don't know how that took a storm on its own when I give everything I have here.\n\n\"It's crazy when things go on social media, how fast they go. I would never say anything like that.\"\n\nOn that call, Trump made a widely circulated comment about the U.S. women's hockey team, which also won Olympic gold.\n\nWhen Trump extended an invitation to the men's players to come to Washington for the State of the Union address, he said: \"I must tell you, we're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that,\" adding with a laugh that if he didn't also invite the women's team, \"I do believe I probably would be impeached.\" Some players laughed along with the joke.\n\nTeam USA star Hilary Knight said Wednesday on \"SportsCenter\" that she thought it was a \"distasteful\" joke that \"unfortunately is overshadowing\" the success her team had in Milan. Boston Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, a member of Team USA, said Wednesday that \"we should've reacted differently.\"\n\nLike other American players, Tkachuk detailed a positive relationship between the men's and women's teams in the Olympics, from attending each other's games to hanging out at 3 a.m. in the Olympic Village café after the men returned as champions.\n\nTkachuk said he understood why women's players could feel insulted by that comment.\n\n\"I mean, I get it,\" he said. \"We support them, they support us. You can't control what other people say. It was fun being around them, seeing how they play and the excellence around them.\n\n\"If I see one of them, we'll talk about the excitement of what we can control, which is to be gold medalists.\"\n\nAs for why the men's team laughed at Trump's comment, Tkachuk said the players were \"caught off guard\" a little bit.\n\n\"I don't really have an answer. It's a whirlwind of a moment,\" he said. \"You can't control what somebody says. I guess got caught off guard a little bit. You're talking to the president 10 minutes after you achieve your dream.\"\n\nBrady Tkachuk is one of five Team USA players whose NHL clubs are based in Canada. He partied in Miami with his teammates and then attended the State of the Union Address in Washington before returning to Ottawa.\n\n\"It was special,\" he said. \"Being an American citizen, you never really think you're going to see the White House and be in the Oval Office.\"\n\nBut Tkachuk noted the awkwardness of helping the U.S. defeat Canada for the gold medal while being the captain for a team in Canada's capital, a position he has held the past five seasons in Ottawa.\n\n\"It's just such a passionate fan base,\" he said. \"I said this after 4 Nations: It's a unique feeling when every single day the support from this fan base and then for three weeks they're not cheering for you. It's a crazy feeling.\n\n\"I've given absolutely everything I have as an Ottawa Senator. When you represent the U.S., it's about being an American. It's an honor. There's only three teams that ever won the gold medal. I wanted to achieve my childhood dream and bring a gold medal back to the U.S.\""

            "content": "Adam Schefter breaks down the Jets' decision to trade Jermaine Johnson to the Titans for T'Vondre Sweat. (1:03)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nThe Jets and Titans agreed to a rare player-for-player trade Thursday, with New York sending pass rusher Jermaine Johnson to Tennessee for defensive tackle T'Vondre Sweat, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe trade can't be processed until the start of the league year on March 11.\n\nThe deal marks the latest move in a protracted teardown of a once-formidable defense for the Jets, who also traded away defensive stars Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams -- both former first-round draft picks -- in November.\n\nEight of the Jets' 11 first-round picks from 2015 to 2022 have been traded.\n\nJohnson acknowledged the trade in a social media post later Thursday, saying New York \"will always hold a special place in my heart.\"\n\nNew York, thank you for everything truly. The love I've been shown here for the past 4-5 years has been nothing short of amazing, both on and off the field. Y'all will always hold a special place in my heart. Wish all of my former coaches and former teammates the best!! Thank all... — Jermaine Johnson II (@ii_jermaine) February 26, 2026\n\nJohnson will be reunited with Titans coach Robert Saleh, who coached the Jets when they selected Johnson with the 26th overall pick in the 2022 draft.\n\nJohnson also will once again play under new Titans defensive line coach Aaron Whitecotton, who was his position coach with the Jets his first three seasons.\n\nJohnson, coming off a down year (three sacks), has only one year remaining on his contract and is due to make a guaranteed $13.4 million in 2026, the amount of his fifth-year option.\n\nJohnson generated interest last season before the trade deadline, but the Jets opted to keep him for the remainder of the season. His departure reinforces the belief that the Jets will take an edge player with the No. 2 pick in this year's draft, with Ohio State's Arvell Reese and Texas Tech's David Bailey as the leading candidates.\n\nIn Sweat, the Jets are getting a 6-foot-2, 366-pound interior presence on a team-friendly contract. A second-round pick in 2024, he is signed through 2027 and will count only $1.7 million on the Jets' salary cap.\n\nScheme factored into the trade for both teams. The Jets, who could be using more 3-4 fronts, wanted to add more size up front. The opposite is true for Tennessee, where Saleh's scheme puts a premium on smaller, faster linemen.\n\nSweat, drafted 38th overall in 2024, posted 85 tackles and three sacks in 29 games for the Titans. He suffered an ankle injury in Tennessee's season-opening loss to the Broncos and missed five games last season.\n\nThe Titans are counting on Johnson regaining his form from 2023, when he posted a career-high 7.5 sacks and was named to the Pro Bowl as an injury replacement. His 2024 season didn't last long. In Week 2, at Tennessee, he tore an Achilles tendon and missed the remainder of the season.\n\nJohnson rehabbed to make it back for the start of the 2025 season, but he didn't have the same burst as before the injury. In 14 games, he finished with only three sacks and six quarterback hits, later admitting his performance wasn't up to his standard. Both he and the team acknowledged that the Achilles injury probably affected his performance.\n\nIn four seasons -- 47 games -- with the Jets, Johnson has 13 sacks and 131 tackles.\n\nESPN's Turron Davenport contributed to this report."

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private.\n\nThe person added that while the team is excited to attend, it's unclear if the entire 23-player roster will be on hand because of potential scheduling conflicts.\n\nThe team has yet to determine whether to visit the White House after USA Hockey cited logistics and travel issues in politely declining President Donald Trump's invitation to join the U.S. men's gold medal-winning team at his State of the Union speech on Tuesday.\n\nFlavor Flav is a longtime supporter of women's sports and attended various Olympic competitions this month. He posted his invitation on Monday, shortly after the women turned down the trip to Washington.\n\n\"If the USA Women's Hockey team wants a real celebration and invite ,,, I'll host them in Las Vegas. Do some nice dinners and shows and good times,\" he wrote. \"I'm sure I can get a hotel and airline to help me out here and celebrate these women for real for real.\"\n\nThe women's team was originally scheduled to fly commercially to New York on Monday, but was forced to reroute through Atlanta because of a snowstorm in the Northeast. The timing and storm made it difficult for the women to change plans as they returned to their Professional Women's Hockey League and college teams across the country.\n\nTeam USA won gold after beating Canada in the Women's Ice Hockey final. EPA/FAZRY ISMAIL\n\nThe PWHL schedule resumed Thursday with Montreal playing at New York following a monthlong Olympic break, while college players open their conference playoffs this weekend.\n\nIn his address, Trump said plans were in the works to have the women's team visit the White House, though it's unclear when that could happen, USA Hockey said. The earliest the team could travel to Washington would be in late spring after the conclusion of the PWHL season.\n\nThe president's invitation came late Sunday, when he called to congratulate the men for their 2-1 overtime win over Canada. The women's team was still in Milan, three days after also beating Canada 2-1 in overtime.\n\nIn speaking to the men's team following their win, Trump said: \"We're going to have to bring the women's team, you do know that.\" He later joked that if he didn't extend the invitation, he would probably be impeached.\n\nU.S. women's captain Hilary Knight on Wednesday referred to the comment as being \"distasteful and unfortunate.\"\n\n\"I think just the way women are represented, it's a great teaching point and really shines light on how women should be championed for their amazing feats,\" she said."

            "content": "Stephen Holder explains why Anthony Richardson's time with the Colts could be coming to an end this offseason. (0:53)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- The Colts have given quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. permission to seek a trade, his agent told ESPN on Thursday, the latest twist in the young player's complicated career.\n\nRichardson lost a preseason position battle with veteran Daniel Jones before last season, relegating him to the No. 2 spot. Now, with the Colts committed to try to re-sign Jones as their starter for the foreseeable future, Richardson faces an uncertain path forward in Indianapolis.\n\nGiving agent Deiric Jackson the ability to explore a trade gives Richardson the potential of finding a new start after three tumultuous seasons in Indianapolis. The 2023 fourth overall draft pick has started 15 games for the Colts, throwing 11 touchdowns and 13 interceptions. Injuries have stymied him throughout his career, with Richardson missing 13 games after shoulder surgery as a rookie in 2023 and four games to multiple injuries in 2024.\n\nLast season, Richardson sustained a fractured orbital bone in a freak pregame warmup incident. That injury left Richardson on injured reserve, where he finished the season.\n\nRichardson, who is still just 23, had his vision impacted by the injury. But recent consultations with doctors indicate his vision has been restored, Jackson said. One physician noted his vision in a recent test to be 20/20 when using both eyes.\n\nColts general manager Chris Ballard on Tuesday said the vision issues were \"trending in the right direction\" and that Richardson was \"cleared to play.\" But he did not indicate the issues were fully resolved.\n\nThe Colts are expected to move forward this year with Jones and 2025 draft pick Riley Leonard at 1 and 2, respectively, on their quarterback depth chart. Jones sustained a torn Achilles tendon in early December but is on schedule to return for the start of next season, Ballard said this week. Jones is a pending free agent, but Ballard said Tuesday he remains hopeful the Colts can re-sign him to a new deal without having to use the franchise tag.\n\nBallard said \"I still believe in Anthony\" when asked about the player's future this week, but it has been clear for quite some time that Richardson did not have a clear role with the team in 2026. The Colts' decision to bench him temporarily in 2024 undermined their statements about their belief in him. And the decision to go out and sign Jones as a free agent last spring created additional doubt about Richardson's long-term viability with the franchise.\n\nThe decision to allow conversations with other teams was communicated during a meeting with Ballard and Richardson's camp on Thursday. In that meeting, Ballard expressed a willingness to work with Richardson to find a suitable landing spot. That's why the decision to allow Jackson to speak with other teams and find a match works in the player's favor.\n\nRichardson has one season remaining on his rookie contract provided unless his 2027 fifth-year option is exercised. He is due a $1.145 million base salary and a $4.24 million roster bonus that is due in August. The Colts would save $5.385 million in salary cap space with $5.43 million in dead money if Richardson is traded before June 1."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- The NCAA football oversight committee is recommending emergency legislation to protect the transfer portal window by issuing penalties for schools and coaches who circumvent the rules.\n\nThe committee on Wednesday proposed the legislation to penalize schools who add players who did not make public their interest in transferring during the January transfer portal window.\n\nThe proposed legislation would become effective immediately if approved at the Division I cabinet meeting in April.\n\nAmong the proposed penalties, the head coach who accepts a transfer who did not properly enter the January portal would be prohibited from all recruiting, on-field coaching and team meetings for six games.\n\nThe school accepting the transfer would be fined 20% of its football budget. Also, the school would lose five roster spots for the following season, even if it no longer employs the coach who accepted the transfer.\n\nGeorgia athletic director Josh Brooks said it is important to enforce the transfer portal window rule.\n\n\"Attempts to circumvent the transfer window process is an issue for the sport,\" Brooks said in a statement released by the NCAA. \"We want to let everyone know that this is not going to be allowed, and the committee wants to protect the transfer window that has been established.\"\n\nBuffalo athletic director Mark Alnutt, the chair of the oversight committee, said \"significant penalties\" are needed to enforce the transfer rule.\n\n\"We felt this was appropriate to place an emphasis on this rule with where we are in Division I football,\" Alnutt said. \"We have a window for student-athletes to notify their school when they would like to enter the transfer portal. If there is movement without going through the process as it is legislated, the committee felt there needed to be significant penalties.\"\n\nThe committee also voted to eliminate the annual limit on official recruiting visits.\n\nThe transfer rule and compensation for players through name, image and likeness contracts have created other issues. The University of Cincinnati is suing its former quarterback, Brendan Sorsby, following his transfer to Texas Tech. Cincinnati is accusing Sorsby of breaching his NIL contract, which the school says was signed in July 2025 to cover the 2025 and 2026 seasons. Cincinnati says the contract included a $1 million buyout if Sorsby transferred.\n\nSorsby received the most lucrative deal of the portal period -- a reported $5 million -- to return to his home state for his final season."

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "Dr Victor Doke calls for sanctions over breach of demarcated zones\n\nA Security Lecturer at the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre, Dr Victor Doke, has called on the Fisheries Commission to strictly enforce sanctions against fishermen who go beyond approved fishing zones.\n\nHis comments follow the recent armed robbery incident at sea, where several Ghanaian fishermen were attacked, and their valuables were violently taken at gunpoint on Wednesday, February 25.\n\nAccording to him, consistent enforcement would not only ensure compliance but also enhance safety at sea. He explained that staying within approved limits makes rescue operations easier during emergencies, reduces exposure to pirate attacks, and allows fishermen to return to shore quickly when faced with difficulties.\n\nSpeaking on JoyNews' The Pulse on February 26, Dr Doke said education alone is not deterring fisherfolk from flouting regulations, stressing that enforcement must now take centre stage.\n\n“There’s a difficult call for the Fisheries Commission, and I don’t know how they get to do it, whether they have to now plant men in the canoes where these fisherfolks are going on hikes or what. But since they’ve been educated, it’s not working,” he stated.\n\nDr Doke argued that the law is clear on enforcement, and authorities must not relent in enforcement.\n\n“I think what the law has said should be implemented. Now, if you realise that the fisherfolks have gone beyond a certain limit, what are the sanctions? You just apply it,” he said.\n\n“When we begin to apply sanctions, many of those fisherfolks will learn that for their own safety you are required to stay at a certain limit,” he noted. “It’s all about implementing sanctions. If you are not able to do that, then it means we just go back to the same problem over and over again.”\n\nBeyond national enforcement, Dr Doke also raised concerns about the broader, regional dimension of maritime security, urging a more coordinated approach among countries within the sub-region to address the changing dynamics of threats at sea.\n\nThe recent attack has once again drawn attention to security vulnerabilities in Ghana’s maritime space and the need for stricter adherence to fisheries regulations as part of efforts to protect lives and livelihoods.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Upon arrival at the port, the DVLA registers the excavator before clearance. Thereafter, the Minerals Commission installs a tracking device on the equipment prior to release from the port,” he detailed.\n\nThe Minister disclosed that the government has procured and deployed more than 1,000 digital tracking devices to monitor and regulate the movement and use of excavators and other mining equipment nationwide.\n\nThe initiative, he said, is being implemented in accordance with the Minerals Operation Tracking of Earth-Moving and Mining Equipment Regulations (LI 2404) and is designed to enhance real-time monitoring, improve transparency, and strengthen accountability within the mining sector.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The government has introduced new conditions for entry into Ghana’s medicinal cannabis industry, requiring investors to secure confirmed buyers before obtaining licences to operate.\n\nThe Minister for the Interior, Muntaka Mohammed-Mubarak, announced this at a press briefing in Accra on Thursday, February 26.\n\nHe said the measure is intended to prevent diversion of cannabis into the illegal market and to protect public safety.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed-Mubarak stated that applicants must show a clear market for their produce as part of the licensing process.\n\nHe said authorities would not grant licences to individuals who cannot identify who they intend to sell to.\n\n“We won’t give you the licence if you don’t show us who you are going to sell it to. You need to have an off-taker,” he said, adding that the government will not permit cultivation without secured buyers.\n\nThe directive introduces stricter operational conditions in the rollout of Ghana’s medicinal cannabis programme. It affects farmers, investors, and processors seeking to enter the sector.\n\nThe policy is being implemented under the Narcotics Control Commission Amendment Act, 2023 and the Cannabis Regulations, 2023. These laws provide legal backing for the cultivation and management of cannabis strictly for industrial and medicinal purposes.\n\nAlhaji Mohammed-Mubarak stressed that recreational use of cannabis remains illegal. “For the avoidance of doubt, cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC remains a prohibited narcotic,” he said.\n\nHe outlined additional controls that prospective operators must meet.\n\nAccording to him, a total of 11 different licences are required across the value chain, including cultivation, processing, transportation, import, and export. Each licence is activity-specific and non-transferable.\n\n“You cannot cultivate and assume you can transport. You need another licence for that,” he explained.\n\nThe minister also said Ghana does not currently produce the specialised low-THC cannabis seeds required for the programme. As a result, all seeds must be imported under licence.\n\n“Government is not positioning itself to provide the seeds. It is a business opportunity for those who want to import,” he said, while encouraging research institutions to develop local seed capacity over time.\n\nTo prevent abuse and diversion into illegal channels, the Interior Ministry, working with the Narcotics Control Commission and other security agencies, will apply surveillance and enforcement measures. These include GPS tracking, drone monitoring, and unannounced inspections of licensed facilities.\n\nSecurity agencies such as the police, immigration service, prisons service, and the National Investigations Bureau will take part in enforcement.\n\nMr Mohammed-Mubarak warned that failure to comply with the regulations could have consequences for the country’s standing internationally. “If we get it wrong, Ghana could easily be blacklisted, and all the efforts will come to nothing,” he said.\n\nHe added that licensed facilities must not be located within 100 metres of schools or residential areas. Operators are also required to submit quarterly returns or face sanctions.\n\nOn the economic outlook, the Minister said although the sector has the potential to generate substantial revenue, the government’s immediate concern is public safety.\n\n“Our emphasis is more on security and public safety than on money. If we do it right, the benefits will come,” he said.\n\nThe introduction of the off-taker requirement is expected to shape participation in the sector. It limits entry to investors who can show full commercial readiness from production to sale.\n\nFor many local farmers and small-scale entrants, the directive raises the entry threshold. It indicates that participation will require not only land and interest but also firm market arrangements and capital.\n\nMr Mohammed-Mubarak said the government remains open to engagement but will enforce the rules. “Our doors are open 24/7, but we will make sure the intent of the law is fully achieved,” he said.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The minority in Parliament is urging President John Dramani Mahama to address pressing issues affecting Ghanaians ahead of his State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Friday, February 27.\n\nAccording to the Caucus, the President must provide a detailed account of the recent cocoa price reduction, a move they say has sparked serious concerns among farmers and industry stakeholders.\n\nThey are also seeking explanations regarding ongoing complaints about rapidly depleting prepaid electricity credit, which many consumers say is adding to their financial burden.\n\nSpeaking to JoyNews’ Kwaku Asante on February 26 ahead of SONA tomorrow, the Member of Parliament for Akim Swedru, Kennedy Osei Nyarko, outlined the matters he believes the President must address.\n\nOn the general mood in the country, he said, \"You can see there is a lot of despondency among the Ghanaian people. We've recently heard about the cocoa haircut, which has affected over a million of cocoa farmers in the country.”\n\nHe further explained the impact on farmers and their families:\n\n“They are not only talking about just the million; they have a lot of dependents, those who are students in school, and all those things. These are very difficult moments for those Ghanaian farmers that are losing money as a result of the government's decision to cut down the producer price.\"\n\nTouching on electricity tariff concerns, he stated:\n\n“Recently, we also heard about people complaining about electricity. This was a decision that was taken by the government just to increase the electricity tariff by some 28%, and we are now feeling the impact of it. So, these are people who are complaining.”\n\nOn youth unemployment, he added:\n\n“The youth who were promised employment are still saying that they have not gotten the job that this government promised them.”\n\nHe stressed that these are the key issues that must be addressed: “These are three key things. So, if the president is coming here tomorrow, he should be bringing solutions as to how these matters are going to be dealt with.”\n\nHe cautioned against relying solely on macroeconomic indicators: “It is not enough to say that inflation has come down; the cedi is strong. I mean, it is not enough. That is not enough. We are talking about bread-and-butter issues.”\n\nHe continued, “Bread issues are affecting the ordinary person, those who have that hope in this government and went to the queue to vote for that government. That is what we are looking at. So, if the government is not coming to give solutions to these issues, well, I don't know what is coming.”\n\nHe was of the view that Ghanaians are not interested in peripheral matters:\n\n“He can decide to be talking about plenty of things, but that is not what the Ghanaian populace is interested in.”\n\nAccording to him, the President has an opportunity to respond directly to these concerns:\n\n“We are interested in this matter that I put before you, and I believe tomorrow the President will have a fine opportunity to come and tell the Ghanaian people that this is how I intend to solve the electricity challenges that people are complaining.”\n\nDrawing a comparison with past leadership, he observed:\n\n“It happened in 2018 when Ghanaians were complaining about high tariffs on electricity. Akufo-Addo took a decision to reduce electricity tariffs by 14% for non-residential consumers, and that is what leadership is about.”\n\n\"I expect President Mahama and his government to also pull the same line and protect the ordinary person,\" he emphasised.\n\nFollowing the minority’s remarks, the Member of Parliament for Tamale North, Alhassan Suhuyini (NDC), has defended President John Dramani Mahama, arguing that many of the issues currently facing the country were inherited from previous administrations.\n\n“I’m happy they acknowledge that they have created problems that His Excellency President Mahama is creating solutions for. Because, clearly, when you talk about cocoa, I think that those who have followed the discussion are now fully aware that the problem was fully inherited by President Mahama, and the steps that he is taking are steps that will resolve the problems, not just for his regime, but for even governments that will come after him,” he said.\n\nHe also highlighted challenges in the electricity sector, which he says was left in disarray by the previous government: “When you talk about electricity, we know the debts that they left behind in that sector; the mismanagement of even ESLA, which was left for them to solve the problems in that sector itself, became a subject of mismanagement, and they know the mess that they created. I'm not surprised. They are hoping that solutions will be featured in President Mahama's SONA.”\n\nMr Suhuyini said expectations for solutions are based on confidence in the President’s leadership:\n\n“I think that it is based on their confidence in him and the confidence of the Ghanaian people in him to inherit problems and to fix them for the future. And I am also expecting solutions to the problems that they, in the NPP, created.”\n\nHe explained that Mahama returned to the presidency specifically to tackle these inherited challenges:\n\n“That is the only reason why President Mahama decided to return to be president, so that he could resolve the challenges that they left behind.”\n\nOn macroeconomic issues, he added:\n\n“They are not interested in macroeconomic figures because they know that he has already fixed that problem that they created, taking us to DDEP, the first time in the history of this country. We were unable to service our debt. Pensioners had to endure haircuts, and they know that President Mahama, within a year, has fixed that problem, and so that's why they no longer want to listen to that.”\n\nHe concluded by praising the President’s approach:\n\n“But President Mahama, being who he is, will give a correct account of the affairs of the state, and he will do so sincerely, and he will do so with the humility that he is noted for.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Member of Parliament for Kintampo, Joseph Kwame Kumah, called on the President to provide an honest and unflinching account of the nation’s state.\n\n“The President's State of the Nation Address, which is an annual requirement, has become a ritual. And what we expect the President, for instance, to tell Ghanaians is nothing but the truth. The real State of the Nation Address should tell Ghanaians what it will take them to accept whatever outcomes are ahead of us,” he said.\n\n“Some of us will not like anything like flattering. Ghanaians are waiting for nothing but truism,” he added.\n\nIn response to criticisms from the NPP regarding cocoa, the economy, and other issues, he stated that the government has made measurable progress.\n\n“Even this morning, I'm understanding inflation has further reduced to about 3.5%. What do they expect?\" he said.\n\nHe highlighted improvements for ordinary traders:\n\n“The common trader will tell you from Makola Market that she is able now to buy rice at low as even 25 cedis. 50 cedis per kilo, which was a total of 150 cedis.”\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "The Africa Prosperity Network (APN) has unveiled a bold 12-point Action Compact calling for the urgent implementation of Africa’s long-standing integration agenda, including visa-free travel across all African Union (AU) member states.\n\nThe Compact was adopted at the 2026 edition of the Africa Prosperity Dialogues, held from February 4 to 6 at the Accra International Conference Centre, under the theme: “Empowering SMEs, Women and Youth in Africa’s Single Market: Innovate. Collaborate. Trade.”\n\nDescribed as a “People’s Compact,” the document reflects the collective position of 6,530 participants who travelled to Accra from 51 African countries and 40 others across the world.\n\nCentral to the Compact is a demand for visa-free travel for Africans within Africa. Delegates argued that without free movement of people, the vision of a truly integrated single market of 1.5 billion people will remain unattainable.\n\nThey stressed that mobility is critical to unlocking trade, innovation, and investment opportunities across borders.\n\nThe Compact also calls for seamless cross-border trade, including systems that allow Africans to buy and sell goods and services across countries using mobile money wallets.\n\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) emphasised that practical digital payment interoperability could significantly boost intra-African commerce, especially under the framework of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nParticipants agreed that Africa does not need new declarations but must fully implement existing treaties and protocols.\n\nThey cited the Abuja Treaty, the AfCFTA Agreement, the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, and AfCFTA protocols on Digital Trade and on Women and Youth in Trade as frameworks already in place but awaiting full execution.\n\nAlthough the Free Movement Protocol was adopted in 2018, only four member states have ratified it—far below the 15 required for it to enter into force.\n\nDelegates warned that without ratification and enforcement, businesses will continue to face barriers to scaling across borders, undermining Africa’s integration efforts.\n\nWith youth unemployment described as the continent’s most urgent challenge, speakers argued that economic integration is no longer optional.\n\nThey estimated that Africa must create between 15 and 20 million jobs annually to meet growing demand and cautioned that fragmented markets are economically self-defeating for individual countries and the continent as a whole.\n\nThe Compact anchors the “Make Africa Borderless Now!” movement—a continent-wide petition campaign targeting 10 million signatures.\n\nOrganisers say the petition will be presented to the AU Assembly in February 2027, demanding swift ratification and implementation of existing agreements.\n\nChairperson of the APN Advisory Council, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, described the Compact as the unified voice of Africa’s private sector, women, and youth.\n\n“The tools for prosperity already exist. The time for implementation is now,” she said.\n\nShe referenced Agenda 2063, the continent’s long-term development blueprint, launched in 2013 during her tenure as Chairperson of the African Union Commission.\n\nThe 2026 Compact now places renewed pressure on African governments to move from commitments to concrete action.\n\nDelegates maintained that meaningful integration—through open borders, digital payments, and enforceable trade rules—is essential for job creation, economic resilience, and shared prosperity across the continent.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

We have gotten approval from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for them to travel and do this for Ghanaians staying abroad. They don't need to come down to renew their one-year licence, which has expired. We will provide all licensing services for them.\"\n\nDVLA Chief Executive, Julius Neequaye Kotey, discloses the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has approved processes for some selected DVLA staff to be stationed in five countries in both Europe and America to offer license services.#JoyNews pic.twitter.com/qMxwYoy6yo — JoyNews (@JoyNewsOnTV) February 26, 2026\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, refuted these claims, stating categorically that \"it has neither issued any directive to diplomatic missions abroad nor granted approval to any entity for such an arrangement\".\n\nIt added, “The Ministry is not aware of any new government policy to that effect,” emphasising that “there is no record at the Ministry supporting the existence of this purported policy direction.”\n\n“For the avoidance of doubt, there has been no formal engagement, no new policy presented to our attention, and no financial commitment that could serve as irrefutable evidence of such an arrangement,” the statement further emphasised.\n\nREAD ALSO : DVLA reviews plan to send staff abroad after public backlash\n\nThe ministry assured the general public of its commitment to transparency and financial prudence in public service delivery.\n\nMeanwhile, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) has moved to clarify what it described as media reports suggesting that its domestic staff would be posted to foreign embassies to provide driver licensing services.\n\nREAD ALSO: DVLA clarifies reports on staff deployment abroad for licensing services\n\n\n\nIn a statement dated February 26, which appears as a U-turn, the Authority insisted the initiative does not involve posting DVLA officers abroad.\n\n“This operation does not in any way mean that the DVLA would post its domestic staff to work at Embassies in the aforementioned countries as the news headlines sought to portray,” the statement read.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Their final group fixture will be against Croatia on June 27.\n\n\n\nAs part of their preparations, Ghana is scheduled to regroup in March for international friendlies against the Austria national football team and Germany national football team, before rounding off their build-up with a test against the Mexico national football team in May."

            "content": "News outlets will not be allowed to broadcast former President Donald Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday in a New York state court, a judge said Monday night, but he will allow some photographers to take pictures in the courtroom before the proceedings formally begin.\n\nActing New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan rejected the request by several media organizations, including CNN, for permission to broadcast the historic proceedings. Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

            "content": "A Ukrainian tank is seen near the frontline area amid the Russia-Ukraine war, in Bakhmut, Ukraine, on April 02. (Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The former secretary of state accused the Republican-led panel of seeking to protect political allies in probe.\n\nFormer United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has condemned the conduct of a Republican-led panel investigating links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, accusing congressional lawmakers of trying to “protect one political party and one public official”.\n\nClinton had been subpoenaed to testify before the panel, made up of members of the House of Representatives, on Thursday.\n\nBut before her appearance, she published her opening statement online, which criticised an “institutional failure” in the US government to “seek truth and justice for the victims and survivors”.\n\nClinton’s husband, former US President Bill Clinton, is set to testify before the same panel on Friday. Both are Democrats.\n\nThe pair have maintained they had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activity and have long said they have provided all relevant information to the lawmakers on the panel.\n\nIn her statement, Clinton also accused the Republicans of using the hearings as a red herring to divert blame away from the administration of President Donald Trump.\n\n“You have compelled me to testify, fully aware I have no knowledge that would assist in your investigation, in order to distract attention from President Trump’s actions and to cover them up,” Clinton wrote.\n\nShe also questioned why the panel has allowed other subpoenaed individuals to provide answers in writing, and why its hearings have taken place behind closed doors.\n\nClinton and her husband, meanwhile, were threatened with charges of contempt, after they resisted the subpoena to appear in person.\n\nScrutinising Epstein’s social circle\n\nThe conflict centres around a long-running push to pursue accountability for those who may have been involved in shielding Epstein from justice.\n\n\n\nEpstein, a wealthy financier, had cultivated contacts with high-powered individuals in politics, academia and the arts. His circle of friends included both Bill Clinton and Trump.\n\nBut he was also a convicted sex offender, whose victims, experts say, number in the hundreds.\n\nIn 2008, he was convicted in Florida of soliciting a minor for prostitution, but he served only 13 months of an 18-month sentence, as part of a plea deal criticised as overly lenient.\n\nIn 2019, federal prosecutors charged Epstein with running a sex-trafficking ring, but Epstein, 66, died by apparent suicide while in custody, awaiting trial.\n\nSpeculation has continued to grow over how his influential social circle may have aided his crimes.\n\nBut the scandal has been a thorn in the side of the Trump administration, which faced backlash over its initial resistance to publishing the government’s full Epstein file.\n\nMedia reports over the last year have also highlighted elements of Trump’s past relationship with Epstein, including a sexually suggestive birthday note the Republican leader appeared to have written.\n\nIn her statement, Clinton said that, if the House panel were committed to a fair investigation, “it would ask [Trump] directly under oath about the tens of thousands of times he shows up in the Epstein files”.\n\nShe also made a reference to an email exchange between Epstein and billionaire Elon Musk, released in a trove of documents by the Department of Justice.\n\nIf the panel were “serious”, she wrote, “it would subpoena anyone who asked on which night there would be the ‘wildest party’ on Epstein Island”.\n\n‘A full-blown coverup?’\n\nNew details emerged about Epstein and his associates on January 30, when the Department of Justice published nearly 3.5 million government documents related to the convicted sex offender.\n\nA law, passed in November, had compelled the Trump administration to release all its Epstein files within 30 days.\n\nBut critics have continued to accuse the administration of failing to release all of the investigative files, as required.\n\nThe Justice Department has said it would review claims it has illegally withheld documents containing allegations against Trump.\n\nA person’s appearance in the files does not necessarily imply criminal conduct. But survivors, sexual violence advocates and some politicians have called for greater accountability and transparency, given the scale and nature of Epstein’s crimes.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for further action.\n\n\n\n“What else is the administration keeping behind a lock and key? Is this incompetence or is it a full-blown coverup?” he said. “Pam Bondi owes the American people some answers.”\n\nFor his part, House Oversight Committee chair James Comer denied that the panel’s investigation was a “witch hunt”.\n\nHe told supporters in advance of Thursday’s hearing that there was bipartisan support for the Clintons to testify.\n\nComer also said the government had “failed” Epstein’s victims. While the panel cannot prosecute anyone involved, he added that he hoped it could help bring transparency.\n\nA full transcript and video of the Clinton hearings, which are expected to stretch on for several hours, will be released “as soon as everyone approves it”, according to Comer.\n\nSpeaking in advance of the hearing, Robert Garcia, the ranking Democrat on the panel, called for Trump himself to testify “to answer the questions that are being asked across this country from survivors”."

But absolutely determined to seize the future, and we can do it better together.”\n\nA joint statement highlighted cooperation in the field of “horizon scanning”, describing it as a mechanism that “helps identify emerging global trends in areas like technology, economy and society, by leveraging data”.\n\nIsrael also agreed to allow 50,000 more Indian nationals into the country, where tens of thousands of South Asians have filled construction and caregiving jobs since new restrictions were placed on Palestinian workers at the start of its war on Gaza.\n\nStrategic embrace\n\nModi’s visit, his second since he took office in 2014, has drawn criticism at home, signalling an ongoing expansion of India’s strategic embrace of Israel amid ongoing tensions over Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza, which has killed more than 72,000 people.\n\nConfirming their growing ties, the leaders’ joint statement referenced the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and an April 2025 attack on tourists and civilians in Pahalgam, in Indian-controlled Kashmir.\n\n\n\n“Terrorism cannot be accepted in any form or expression,” said Modi, who has historically supported the establishment of a Palestinian state yet has sometimes abstained from criticism of Israel in international forums, including the United Nations.\n\nEarlier this month, India was among the countries that condemned Israeli measures to effectively deepen its control over the occupied West Bank.\n\nBoth countries also lauded United States President Donald Trump’s plan to advance the “ceasefire” in the Gaza Strip."

            "content": "Despite its public objections to Israel’s actions, the UK is buying spyware developed and tested on Palestinians.\n\nThe United Kingdom’s government is investing in spyware developed and tested on Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank despite its public criticism of Israeli action there.\n\nIn addition to the Corsight facial recognition technology used to track, trace and detain thousands of Palestinian civilians passing through checkpoints in Gaza and the West Bank, the UK government has disregarded its own public concerns over Israel’s war on Gaza and de facto annexation of the West Bank and has purchased spyware from at least two other Israeli-linked manufacturers: Cellebrite and BriefCam.\n\nCellebrite\n\nCellebrite is an Israeli company closely linked to that country’s military. It has developed software that can bypass passwords and security protocols on smartphones and computers and access data from them.\n\nThat software has been used extensively by the Israeli military on Palestinians across Gaza and the West Bank, including to harvest data from the phones of thousands of detained Palestinians, many of whom have been subjected to systematic torture, a report by the American Friends Service Committee said.\n\nCellebrite is also reported to have received support from the United States Department of Defense to work on technology designed to map underground tunnels in the Gaza Strip.\n\nDespite its stated public concerns over Israeli action in Gaza and the West Bank, records show the UK has entered into several agreements to take advantage of the technology used by Israel in Palestinian territory.\n\nAccording to public records, a number of UK police forces have purchased access to Cellebrite software, including the City of London Police, which renewed its one-year contract with the Israeli company for more than 95,000 pounds ($128,600) in June. Leicestershire Police also renewed its contract with the Israeli spyware company in March for 328,688 pounds ($445,300). The British Transport Police, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office, Kent and Essex police, and Northumbria Police have also entered into contracts with Cellebrite.\n\n\n\nInquiries from Al Jazeera to the UK Home Office, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and the UK Police’s commercial agent, Blue Light Services, have all gone unanswered.\n\nHowever, while declining to comment on “specific customer relationships or contracts”, Victor Cooper, Cellebrite’s senior director of corporate communication, rejected the characterisation of the company’s activities as “hacking”, instead saying, “Cellebrite’s solutions are forensic tools used in legally sanctioned investigations and require physical possession of the device. They do not enable remote access.”\n\nRights groups have raised concerns over Cellebrite exporting its technology to hardline states worldwide, including Myanmar, Serbia and Belarus, where it has been used to extract information from the phones of opposition figures, journalists and activists.\n\nBriefCam\n\nThe Israeli-founded company BriefCam, which was acquired by Canon in 2018 and then by the Danish company Milestone Systems last year, has been providing the UK’s Cumbria Police with surveillance software since at least 2022.\n\nA further disclosure by Police Scotland in June confirms that Scotland’s police service is also considering using the service.\n\nBriefCam was founded in 2007 by Shmuel Peleg, Gideon Ben-Zvi and Yaron Caspi based on technology developed at Israel’s Hebrew University.\n\nThe company provides video synopsis programmes to law enforcement agencies, governments and companies. Police forces and private firms can use BriefCam’s Protect & Insights platform to sift through and condense hours of CCTV and home-surveillance footage, making it easily searchable.\n\nThe system includes facial-recognition and licence-plate search tools and allows police to build “watch lists” of specific faces or vehicle plates.\n\nThe technology has been used in East Jerusalem, Palestinian territory illegally occupied by Israel.\n\nAccording to undated files accessed by the research centre Who Profits, a tender document published by the Israeli Ministry of Housing and Construction inviting companies to bid for maintenance contracts for 98 security systems within East Jerusalem specified that the successful bidder must be able to maintain BriefCam’s software. Israeli public records also show that in 2021, Israeli police committed to a contract valued at $1m for BriefCam’s video analysis systems.\n\nA May 2023 report by the rights group Amnesty International documented how surveillance technology, such as that provided by BriefCam, was instrumental in maintaining Israel’s subjugation of Palestinians.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, the use of surveillance software is critical in maintaining the “continued domination and oppression of Palestinians … [w]ith a record of discriminatory and inhuman acts that maintain a system of apartheid”.\n\nWhile not mentioning BriefCam by name, the report continued: “The Israeli authorities are able to use facial recognition software – in particular at checkpoints – to consolidate existing practices of discriminatory policing, segregation, and curbing freedom of movement, violating Palestinians’ basic rights.”\n\nAccording to the company, the software can also filter footage by a wide range of characteristics, including gender, age group, clothing, movement patterns and time spent in a given location.\n\nAnd that, despite the technology’s links to the oppression of Palestinians, is what makes it attractive to UK police forces.\n\nCumbria Police has said it does not currently use the facial recognition capabilities of BriefCam’s technology.\n\nA spokesperson for Cumbria Police also clarified that the force has been using BriefCam for “several years” and, before introducing the technology, it had “consulted Cumbria’s independent Ethics and Integrity Panel and Strategic Independent Advisory Group”.\n\nA request for a copy of those findings went unanswered.\n\nCorsight\n\nAs previously reported by Al Jazeera, the Israeli company Corsight, through a subcontract with UK company Digital Barriers, has also been selected by the UK Home Office to play a key role in its expansion of facial recognition vans.\n\nIn March 2024, long before the UK government chose to include Corsight within its rollout of facial recognition technology, The New York Times revealed that misgivings over Corsight’s facial-recognition technology in Gaza had led to various members of the Israeli military voicing objections to its use by Unit 8200, Israel’s cyberintelligence branch.\n\nThe expansion of systems such as those marketed by Corsight, Cellebrite and BriefCam is part of a global trade in Israeli spyware, developed and refined through prolonged surveillance of Palestinians, that is now being exported worldwide.\n\nRights groups warned that techniques pioneered in Israel are being used by governments to target activists, journalists and political opponents as concerns deepen over the spread of unregulated cyberwarfare tools.\n\n“The government and police should not be awarding contracts to Israeli spyware firms under any circumstances,” Palestine Solidarity Campaign Deputy Director Ryvka Barnard told Al Jazeera. “These companies develop and test their products through Israel’s regime of military occupation and apartheid against Palestinians. It is unacceptable for public money to be given to these companies, allowing them to profit from and develop new products used to surveil and harm Palestinians.”"

Both were wicketless but gave away only 21 runs in their three overs, while Varun Chakravarthy, Axar Patel and Shivam Dube picked up a wicket each.\n\nEarlier, Sanju Samson made the most of his comeback into the playing 11 by hitting a six off the second ball of India’s innings and going on to score 24 runs off 15 balls.\n\nHis attacking display gave out-of-form opener Abhishek Sharma the time to settle and then launch his own attack from the other end. The world’s top-ranked T20 batter went on to top score with 55 off 30 balls in an innings that comprised four fours and four sixes.\n\n\n\nHe later thanked his teammates and support staff for keeping the faith in him despite his poor performance in the previous matches.\n\n“They told me: you have done this before, as well,” Abhishek said after his innings.\n\nThe rest of India’s top and middle order contributed to the big total, but it was Pandya’s 23-ball-50 at the end of the innings that propelled the home side towards the 250-plus-run mark.\n\nPandya and his batting partner Tilak Varma shared an 84-run partnership that included eight mammoth sixes and five fours as the Indian pair thrashed Zimbabwe’s bowlers.\n\nIndia’s position in the Group 1 points table did not change after the match, but the cohosts now find themselves in a knockout game against the West Indies on Sunday evening in Kolkata.\n\nSouth Africa have progressed to the semifinals after their nine-wicket win over West Indies in the day game in Mumbai.

            "content": "The US says it will licence entities to sell the oil to Cuba except those linked to the Cuban government and military.\n\nAfter months of a crippling oil blockade on Cuba imposed by the United States, the fuel-starved country may now see some relief after the US government said it would begin authorising companies to resell Venezuelan oil, even as tensions between the two reach a head.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US Department of the Treasury said it would allow the resale of Venezuelan oil for “commercial and humanitarian use” in Cuba as the small island nation faces one of its worst fuel crises in decades.\n\nVenezuela is the largest provider of oil to Cuba. However, since US forces abducted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in January and imprisoned him to face drugs and weapons charges in a New York court, the Donald Trump administration has taken control of Caracas’s oil and halted exports to Havana.\n\nWashington has long had frosty relations with Cuba, but Trump’s administration is specifically seeking regime change there by the end of 2026, US media has reported.\n\nThe US’s policy shift this week, however, comes after Caribbean leaders sounded the alarm about the dire situation in Cuba, an island nation of 10.9 million people.\n\nAt a regional meeting of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries on Wednesday, attended by US Secretary of State and Cuban-American Marco Rubio, Jamaica’s Prime Minister Andrew Holness called on Washington to ease the pressure.\n\n“Today, many Cubans are facing serious economic hardship, energy shortages, and growing humanitarian challenges,” Holness said. Cuba is not a CARICOM member but shares close ties.\n\n\n\n“We are sensitive to their struggles. But we must also recognise that a prolonged crisis in Cuba will not remain there. It can impact migration, security and economic stability across the Caribbean, including Jamaica,” he added.\n\nWhat’s the situation in Cuba now?\n\nCuba’s state-dominated economy was already struggling under a US embargo which has been in place since 1962, dating back to Havana’s alliance with the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nSince then, sanctions on Cuba have eased and tightened under various US administrations.\n\nThe long-running sanctions have severely weakened Cuba, causing the country to become highly dependent on imports, and high inflation routinely leads to food and energy shortages. Mass emigration of Cuba’s skilled labour force, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, has added to the country’s difficulties.\n\nWith Trump’s latest oil embargo, the US has added a severe energy crisis to the mix. Widespread power blackouts of up to 20 hours at a time are now being reported across Cuba, impacting hospitals, businesses and households alike.\n\nSurgeries have been suspended, schools have cancelled classes, and waste trucks are parked as rubbish piles up in the streets.\n\nFour United Nations special rapporteurs warned in early February that the situation is contributing to a severe public health problem in the country and said it could lead to a “severe humanitarian” crisis.\n\nCuba has lost 90 percent of its fuel supply, and despite shutting beach resorts and restricting aviation fuel sales, the country could experience a total blackout as early as late February, according to Ignacio Seni, a risk analyst writing for the US-based intelligence firm Crisis 24.\n\nWhy has the US blocked oil deliveries to Cuba?\n\nCuba produces crude oil but does not have the capacity to refine enough to meet domestic demand.\n\nVenezuela was providing as much as 50 percent of Cuba’s oil before the US government took control of its oil industry at the start of this year, about 35,000 barrels per day.\n\nUnder a special barter agreement in place since 2000, Cuba provides support for education, healthcare, and security services in return for discounted Venezuelan fuel. Indeed, about 30 members of Maduro’s security detail who were killed in the operation to abduct him in January were from Cuba.\n\n\n\nThen, days after Maduro was abducted, Trump turned his aim at Cuba itself, warning Havana to “make a deal before it is too late”. He did not, however, give details about what type of deal he wanted.\n\nOn January 29, Trump issued an executive order imposing new trade tariffs on any countries selling oil to Cuba because of what he called the “policies, practices and actions” of the Cuban government, which, he said, pose an “extraordinary threat” to the US.\n\nTrump also claimed, without evidence, that Havana funds “terrorism”.\n\nBesides Venezuela, Cuba was also sourcing oil from Mexico, Russia and Algeria, but all oil imports into the country ceased. Trump’s order, therefore, effectively amounted to a blockade.\n\nThe US has also reportedly seized fuel tankers in open waters transferring oil to Cuba, according to a New York Times investigation into ship movements in the Caribbean Sea published last week.\n\nThe US began building up its naval presence in the area in September last year as it prepared to attack Maduro, and its troops continue to patrol the waters.\n\nIn mid-February, one tanker loaded with Colombian oil was intercepted by the US Coast Guard as it came within 70 miles of Cuba, the Times reported. The vehicle, called the Ocean Mariner, was previously used to covertly transport oil between Venezuela and Iran.\n\nBefore Maduro’s capture, US forces also struck multiple Venezuelan boats in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean that the US claimed – without evidence – were trafficking drugs.\n\nHow have Cuba and others reacted to the US blockade?\n\nCuban authorities under President Miguel Diaz-Canel have accused the US of imposing collective punishment on the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, it also accused the US of links to armed men who entered the country’s waters on a Florida-tagged speedboat. Four Americans of Cuban origin were killed in the altercation, and two were injured.\n\nIn the past, Havana has said it is open to “reciprocal dialogue” with Washington, but Diaz-Canel has also said Cubans will “defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood”.\n\nMeanwhile, on February 12, a UN expert panel condemned the US’s directive as illegal and said the claim that Havana funds terrorism “lacks credibility and appears designed to justify the use of extraordinary and coercive powers”.\n\n“It is an extreme form of unilateral economic coercion with extraterritorial effects, through which the United States seeks to exert coercion on the sovereign state of Cuba and compel other sovereign third States to alter their lawful commercial relations,” the panel said.\n\nOther countries are trying to help. Mexico has sent two deployments of humanitarian aid to Havana between mid-February and this week, while Russia has floated the possibility of sending fuel to Cuba.\n\nOn Wednesday, Canada pledged food aid with 8 million Canadian dollars ($6.7m).\n\nWhat relief has the US announced now, and will it change anything?\n\nWashington said on Wednesday it would issue companies with special licences to resell Venezuelan oil to Cuba “in solidarity” with the Cuban people.\n\n\n\nThat came after Washington announced $6m in humanitarian aid to Cuba to be distributed by the Catholic Church in early February.\n\nHowever, “persons or entities associated with the Cuban military, intelligence services, or other government institutions” will be barred from obtaining oil sales licences, the US Treasury Department said this week.\n\nTransactions should only support “exports for commercial and humanitarian use”, the statement added.\n\nIt is unclear if the new order will allow Havana to continue buying Venezuelan oil at a heavily subsidised rate as it was previously doing. If it does not, the situation may not ease significantly for Cuba, experts say.\n\n“Without significant oil imports or a relenting of US pressure, Cuba’s economy is unlikely to recover, and the degradation of conditions is likely to accelerate,” Seni, the Crisis 24 risk analyst, wrote."

            "content": "Indian PM throws his weight behind Israel’s Netanyahu even as genocide continues in occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has wrapped up a two-day visit to Israel, which was marked by a welcoming embrace from his counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, and a conspicuous silence about Israel’s genocidal war in occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nDuring the visit, which began on Wednesday, the two leaders lauded their strong friendship, which they said has deepened bilateral ties, and signed agreements on a range of issues, including innovation and agriculture.\n\n“You are a great friend of Israel, … Narendra. You are more than a friend. You are a brother,” Netanyahu told Modi when both leaders addressed the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem on Wednesday.\n\nNetanyahu showed Modi around Yad Vashem, a memorial in Jerusalem to the victims of the Holocaust, and hosted a dinner after they had spoken to the Knesset, where Modi was conferred with the parliament’s highest honour.\n\nThis was the second ever visit by an Indian prime minister to Israel after Modi’s first visit in 2017. That time, he also did not visit Palestine despite India’s long history of supporting the Palestinian cause.\n\nWhile India opposed the creation of Israel in 1948 and formalised diplomatic relations only in 1992, relations between the two countries have improved since then, flourishing particularly since Modi became India’s prime minister in 2014.\n\nSince then, their ties have blossomed, anchored in defence and the shared nationalistic leanings of their leaders.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from Modi’s trip to Israel:\n\nFull support for Israel, silence on Gaza genocide\n\nWednesday was the first time an Indian leader had addressed the Knesset. Modi received a standing ovation after declaring: “India stands with Israel firmly, with full conviction, in this moment and beyond.”\n\n\n\nModi told the Israeli parliament that he carries “the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7” in 2023.\n\n“We feel your pain. We share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly, with full conviction, in this moment and beyond,” he said. “No cause can justify the murder of civilians. Nothing can justify terrorism.”\n\nThe Indian prime minister referred to the Mumbai attacks in 2008, which New Delhi has blamed on neighbouring Pakistan, saying: “Like you, we have a consistent and uncompromising policy of zero tolerance for terrorism with no double standards.”\n\nModi also threw his weight behind United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, stating that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.\n\nWhile Modi said he backed “dialogue, peace and stability in the region”, he skipped any mention of the continuing genocide in Gaza, where the Israeli army has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians since October 2023.\n\nAnwar Alam, a senior fellow at the Policy Perspective Foundation, a think tank in New Delhi, said the timing of Modi’s visit is “too poor and has grossly compromised India’s historical pro-Palestine stand”.\n\nAlam argued that while New Delhi, a leader of the anticolonial nonalignment movement, can continue to maintain ties with Tel Aviv, “India cannot allow itself to display such insensitivity to Palestinian sufferings and stand with the coloniser.”\n\nModi emphasises ‘civilisational ties’ with Israel\n\nOne reason Modi, unlike previous Indian leaders, has displayed such warmth towards the Israeli prime minister is the Indian Hindu right’s enthusiasm for the ideology of Zionism, analysts said.\n\nModi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has roots in a philosophy, Hindutva, which ultimately seeks to transform India into a Hindu nation and a natural homeland for Hindus anywhere in the world – similar to Israel’s view of itself as a Jewish homeland.\n\nDuring his speech to the Knesset, therefore, Modi doubled down on what he called the “civilisational ties” between the two nations. He started his address to the Knesset by announcing himself as “a representative of one ancient civilisation addressing another”.\n\n“We are both ancient civilisations, and it is perhaps no surprise that our civilisational traditions also reveal philosophical parallels,” he said, quoting the Israeli “principle of ‘tikkun olam’ about healing the world”.\n\n\n\n“In India, there is great admiration for Israel’s resolve, courage and achievements,” Modi said. “Long before we related to each other as modern states, we were linked by ties that go back more than 2,000 years.”\n\nModi mused about “returning to a land to which I have always felt drawn”. “After all, I was born on the same day that India formally recognised Israel – September 17, 1950.”\n\nWhile India formally recognised Israel in 1950, two years after its formation, it only established diplomatic relations with it in 1992.\n\nDeepening defence ties\n\nThese days, India is Israel’s largest weapons buyer, pumping billions of dollars into Israel’s defence industry each year. In 2024 as Israel waged its war on Gaza, Indian weapons firms sold Israel rockets and explosives, according to an Al Jazeera investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, Modi held talks with Netanyahu focused on further boosting ties in the areas of defence and security along with trade, technology and agriculture.\n\n“We have decided to establish the Critical and Emerging Technologies Partnership. This will give new momentum to cooperation in areas such as AI, quantum, and critical minerals,” Modi said.\n\n\n\nThe two countries are also currently negotiating a free trade agreement.\n\nElevating strategic ties\n\nIndia and Israel are reportedly inching closer to an alliance, along with other global powers, to boost security cooperation.\n\nBefore Modi’s visit, Netanyahu pitched a “hexagon of alliances” that he said would include India, Greece, Cyprus and other unnamed Arab, African and Asian states to collectively stand against what he called “radical” Shia and Sunni Muslim “axes” of adversaries in the region.\n\nModi has not confirmed this plan but did call for cooperation on multilateral projects, including the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) and the I2U2, consisting of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and US.\n\nThe IMEC envisions connecting India with the Middle East and Europe through an integrated rail and shipping corridor. The economic corridor would pass through India, the UAE, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Europe. It was unveiled in September 2023 during a Group of 20 summit in New Delhi.\n\n“IMEC is very ambitious in bringing together these countries in ways that at one point would have been incomprehensible,” said Harsh Pant, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi-based think tank. “Today, it has become possible because India’s footprint has grown in the Middle East and in Europe.”\n\nGeopolitical analysts have referred to the I2U2 as “the West Asian Quad” in reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a forum of the US, Japan, Australia and India.\n\nModi also referred to the Abraham Accords, brokered by the US since 2020 for Gulf and North African countries to normalise relations with Israel, and “applauded your courage and vision”.\n\n“Since then, the situation has changed significantly. The path is even more challenging. Yet it is important to sustain that hope,” Modi said.\n\n‘Dehyphenating’ India from Israel-Palestine\n\nPant said, like some Arab nations, India wants to dehyphenate its relations in the region to suit its own strategic interests better. Dehyphenation is a foreign policy under which a country aims to maintain independent relationships with nations that may be in conflict with each other.\n\n\n\n“India’s own relationships have developed to a point where India is no longer hyphenating its relationships in the region,” Pant said.\n\nAnalysts argued New Delhi has bet on Israel for its own strategic interests, even if at Palestine’s expense. From the Indian government’s point of view, “this is the beginning of a new strategic imagination for the region,” Pant told Al Jazeera.\n\nModi remarked in his speech to the Knesset that many Indians have migrated to Israel for work, adding that Indian youth have contributed to the building of modern Israel, including “also on the battlefield”. Thousands of foreign nationals have served in the Israeli military, including nearly 200 soldiers who are dual citizens of India and Israel.\n\nModi, however, did not mention Colonel Waibhav Kale, a former Indian army officer who died in May 2024 when a United Nations vehicle was struck by the Israeli army in Gaza. He was the first international UN worker in Gaza to die in the war.\n\n“India’s stance is clear: Humanity must never become a victim of conflict. A path to peace has been created through the Gaza peace plan. India has fully supported these efforts,” Modi said before departing on Thursday.\n\nHowever, analysts said the divergence from earlier Indian support for Palestine is stark and India will not call out Netanyahu for war crimes in Palestinian territory.\n\nWhile governments before Modi laid the foundations for current bilateral ties, Modi has brought “this relationship out into the open”, Pant said. “What used to be hush-hush behind closed doors is now a matter of fact.”\n\n“India is trying not to make ties with Israel a hostage to the issue of Palestine,” he argued.\n\nAzad Essa, the author of the 2023 book Hostile Homelands: The New Alliance Between India and Israel, said that earlier, India had positioned itself as a friend of Palestine “because it suited its national interests to be seen as pro-Palestine”.\n\nPopular political forces in New Delhi have shifted that stance since then, however. Given the deep defence and security tie-up between Israel and India, Essa said, “It will be very difficult for opposition parties to promise a U-turn because being pro-Israel has become integral to the national interest.”\n\n“To be pro-Palestine is now seen as being against the Indian national interest,” he said. Some have been detained and charged for expressing support for Palestine in India.\n\n“India will have to become far more democratic and break out of the grip of majoritarian politics if it is to change more than just its tone on Palestine,” Essa told Al Jazeera."

The company will cease sales after March 25th at 11:59PM PT, which is also the cut off to redeem Drop Rewards. After March 31st, the site will be accessible for a limited time to view order history, but all retail functionality will shift to Corsair.\n\nAccording to a blog post on Drop’s site, it’ll transition into a “hub to highlight collaborations across our brands, from The Lord of the Rings to Cyberpunk 2077 and Fallout Nuka Cola, showcasing curated releases within the broader Corsair ecosystem.”\n\nCorsair’s marketing manager Andrew Williams confirmed to The Verge that several products featured on Drop will be integrated into Corsair’s site for purchase, and will continue to be sold at Amazon and Best Buy. So far, the only product it has confirmed will continue is the Drop CSTM80 mechanical keyboard, along with “a variety of our licensed offerings.” Other products will be end-of-life (EOL), particularly hardware collaborations including other companies.\n\nWhen asked if products like Sennheiser or Koss headphone collaborations would move over to Corsair, Williams didn’t confirm or deny on a product-specific level, but stated that “almost all, if not all, of those will end up not being moved over.” He pointed out that Corsair, as a brand, has its own headsets and other products. However, Williams said “the main ones that are sell well and do well, we’re going to continue on Corsair.”\n\nThe Drop team was integrated into Corsair when it was acquired, according to Williams, and the company claims that no layoffs are happening as a result of this decision to wind down the site. Corsair shared that existing orders, including preorders, will be fulfilled as planned, and that the company will honor existing warranties on products.\n\nUpdate, February 26th, 2:35PM ET: Added a link to Drop’s blog post confirming the transition, along with more context about which products will continue to be sold."

What potentially justifies paying $129.99 for Razer’s Laptop Sleeve 16” are the pair of wireless charging pads integrated into its cover flap. While you’re out and about, it can protect a laptop up to 16 inches in size, and when you find a remote spot to sit down and work, you can also plonk down and charge your phone and earbuds.\n\nThe padded sleeve has a plush microfiber lining and reinforced edges to help absorb some of the shock of an accidental drop, but it’s thin enough to stick underneath your laptop to protect its underside from scratches. That’s its primary use case as opening the sleeve’s flap positions a Qi2 charging pad next to your computer that can wirelessly power a smartphone at up to 15W rates, and an accessory like wireless earbuds at up to 5W.\n\nThe sleeve adds 410 grams of weight to your laptop, but adds protection from scratches and bumps. Image: Razer\n\nThe sleeve comes with a USB-C cable so you can power the wireless charging pad from your computer, but not all laptops may provide enough power through their USB ports for two devices to wirelessly charge on the pad at full speed."

The new Cricut Explore 5 is 30 percent “more compact” than the Explore 4 that launched a year ago, without reducing the size or types of materials the machine can handle. The new Cricut Joy 2 is an even smaller alternative to the Explore 5 and adds the ability to precisely slice pre-printed materials so you can finally open that Etsy sticker shop.\n\nThe Cricut Explore 5 will be available starting on February 27th for $199 and comes with enough materials to make up to 30 projects. It can also be purchased as part of more expensive bundles that include additional tools and materials. Despite being up to an inch smaller in some dimensions compared to last year’s model, the Explore 5 can still cut over 100 different materials, including cardstock and vinyl, up to 12 inches wide. It’s compatible with six tools, including various cutting blades, and includes an upgraded snap-in pen holder to improve the machine’s writing and drawing capabilities. You can get it in taupe or teal, which is exclusive to Michaels.\n\nImage: Cricut\n\nThe Cricut Joy 2 will also be available on February 27th but is much cheaper at $99 with enough materials for 35 projects, or you can spring for pricier bundles that include even more.

            "content": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThis is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a newsletter on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week.\n\nThese days, if you \n\nWeb data aggregator Bright Data has been pitching streaming service operators on an alternative approach for apps running on Samsung’s Tizen and LG’s webOS platform — one that comes without ads and sky-high fees. All publishers have to do to unlock a new revenue source is integrate the company’s Bright SDK into their TV apps and convince viewers to opt into Bright’s monetization network.\n\n“We don’t do any kind of tracking,” explained Bright Data’s chief product officer, Ariel Shulman, during a webinar for streaming industry insiders two years ago. “We work silently in the background, and completely anonymously. Users don’t actually see or don’t feel anything.”\n\nThe catch? With Bright’s SDK, a viewer’s smart TV becomes part of a massive global proxy network that crawls and scrapes the web. Including apps running on desktop PCs and mobile devices, the company claims to operate 150 million such residential proxies worldwide. Together, these devices gather petabytes of public web data from a wide range of different locations and IP addresses. This approach allows the company to capture localized versions of websites, but also helps to circumvent web crawler blacklists. The gathered data is then resold to companies to train AI models, among other things.\n\nHere’s how Bright’s smart TV partnerships work: When a consumer downloads and installs a participating app, they’ll see an opt-in screen asking them to confirm their willingness to participate in Bright’s proxy network. For instance, for an app called Petflix that was until recently available on the Roku app store, the note reads:\n\n“To enjoy Petflix for free with fewer ads, you are allowing Bright Data to occasionally use your device’s free resources and IP address to download public web data from the internet. Bright Data will only use your IP address for approved business-related use cases. None of your personal information is accessed or collected except your IP address. Period.”\n\n“Our network is based on consensual individual participation,” explains Bright Data spokesperson Jennifer Burns. “All users can opt-out at any time via a fast two-click process.”\n\nOnce a consumer opts in to Bright Data’s network, their smart TV starts downloading publicly available webpages as well as audio and video data, which is then forwarded to Bright’s cloud servers. The company claims to only do so when it doesn’t impact the device’s bandwidth or processing capacities, with Shulman saying that individual devices download only around 50MB of data per day. In reality, there is no way for a user to know whether the SDK downloads web data at any given moment.\n\nIn some cases, your smart TV may even crawl the web for Bright as soon as you turn it on. “On some operating systems, [...] our SDK is given permissions by the user to run in the background,” Shulman explained during his webinar. “This means that our monetization continues even if the app itself is not running.” All it takes for consumers is to run the app once and opt in to Bright’s network, and the device will keep crawling the web every day until they opt out again or uninstall the app.\n\nBright Data is not the only company operating such residential proxy networks. Some of its competitors have come under fire for unsavory business practices. Last month, Google took action against the IPIDEA network, which Google’s Threat Intelligence Group called “the world’s largest proxy network.” IPIDEA worked with a number of SDK providers to distribute its code in third-party apps, including on smart TVs.\n\nOnce devices were enrolled in its network, IPIDEA’s operators allegedly rented out those resources to hacking groups in China, North Korea, Iran, and Russia. “We [...] observe IPIDEA being leveraged by a vast array of espionage, crime, and information operations threat actors,” Google’s Threat Intelligence Group wrote in a January blog post.\n\nTo be clear: Google’s security researchers did not draw any connection whatsoever between IPIDEA and Bright Data, and Bright goes to great lengths to set itself apart from bad actors. “Our SDK, along with all of our technology, is reviewed by Apesteem, Google, McAfee, and more, and audited regularly, most recently by PwC,” says Burns. “Bright SDK implements rigorous partner selection criteria and vets every application through strict compliance processes.”\n\nThe company has nonetheless been impacted by a broader backlash against residential proxy activities. Google has adopted policies against proxy SDKs running in the background, and is now telling developers that they’re only allowed to use proxy services “in apps where that is the primary, user-facing core purpose of the app.” Amazon added a provision to its developer policies that outright bans “apps that facilitate proxy services to third parties.” Roku also bars developers from using Bright SDK and similar proxy services.\n\nAll those changes have made it more difficult to figure out how widespread the use of the SDK on smart TVs actually is. A few dozen Fire TV apps still mention the SDK on Amazon’s app store, but don’t appear to make use of it anymore. I was able to download a few apps from Roku’s store that were still using the SDK, including the aforementioned Petflix app. However, those apps disappeared from the store after I contacted Roku for this story.\n\nNew restrictions against proxy SDKs have had a direct impact on Bright’s addressable market in the smart TV space. The company used to pitch its solution to Roku, Android TV, and Fire TV app developers, but Burns tells me that it no longer supports these platforms. Bright does still list Samsung’s Tizen OS and LG’s webOS as supported smart TV platforms, and has published more than 200 first-party apps to LG’s app store alone. LG spokesperson Léa Lee tells me that Bright SDK is “not officially supported by LG, and their operation on the webOS platform is not guaranteed.” Samsung did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThere are arguably many legitimate use cases for web crawling. “Our network serves exclusively legitimate purposes, supporting journalists, non-profits, academic researchers, cybersecurity companies, and other leading businesses worldwide,” says Burns.\n\nThe problem is that consumers have no idea whether that legitimate purpose is something that aligns with their own personal values. Case in point: Bright Data does support a number of nonprofits, including some that use its proxy network to track hate speech on social media. However, the company also works with AMCHA Initiative. The group maintains an “anti-zionist faculty barometer” and includes student and faculty statements against Israel’s war in Gaza, as well as calls for schools to divest from the country, in its antisemitic incident tracker.\n\nWith AI companies facing scrutiny over their environmental impact, treatment of intellectual property, and potential to replace human labor, some consumers may also feel uneasy about their TVs gathering data to train AI models.\n\nNow, some consumers may decide that such concerns are overblown, and willingly opt in to Bright’s network if it means that they get to watch fewer ads or pay less for their streaming services. I, for one, would rather watch an extra ad break or two."

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s Chief Merchandising Officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, expiring on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet address. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product, and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

The company plans to prove out a new approach to passively cooling space computers on the ground, then buy a satellite bus from Apex Space and show that it works in orbit by late 2027 or early 2028.\n\nCompanies like SpaceX, Google, or Starcloud are examining traditional satellite form factors for their proposed space data center constellations, which rely on large radiators to keep chips in optimal thermal condition. But Sophia Space’s founders — CTO Leon Alkalai, CEO Rob DeMillo, and chief growth officer Brian Monnin — have a different approach.\n\nThe company’s tech comes from an unusual source: a $100-million-endowed program at Caltech to develop orbital solar plants that would beam electricity to Earth below. The researchers ultimately settled on a sail-like structure that is thin and flexible compared to boxy, traditional satellites.\n\nWhile technical and regulatory challenges make producing electricity for Earth difficult, Alkalai, a fellow at the Caltech-managed Jet Propulsion Laboratory, was struck by the idea of using the design to power space-based processors. (Aetherflux, a space solar power startup, has had a similar realization.)\n\nSophia, an Nvidia partner, has designed modular server racks with integrated solar panels it calls TILES, which are one meter by one meter in area and a few centimeters in depth. By adopting this thin form factor, Demillo says that processors can sit against a passive heat spreader, eliminating the need for active cooling. He expects 92% of the power it generates will go to processing, a significant gain on traditional designs. This design requires, however, a sophisticated software management system to balance activity across the processors.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Demillo argues that attempting to build space data centers with less efficient systems will not be economical, and that a single structure rather than a distributed network linked by lasers will be easier to execute.\n\nFirst, however, Sophia plans to begin by offering its TILEs to satellite operators that require compute solutions on orbit. Potential partners include earth observation satellites collecting large amounts of sensor data, missile warning and tracking systems that the Pentagon is investing billions of dollars to build, or even increasingly complex communications networks.\n\n“The dirty little secret of the satellite industry is we’ve got all these amazing sensors up there that produce terabytes, or even petabytes, of data every few minutes, and they throw most of it out because they can’t do the computing on board and they can’t get round trip back and forth to the surface fast enough,” Demillo told TechCrunch."

Now, analyst firm IDC predicts that this will cause smartphone shipments to plummet by 12.9% this year, making it the biggest dip in more than a decade.\n\nEarlier this year, IDC said that manufacturers shipped 1.26 billion devices in 2025. The firm predicts that the volume will dip to only 1.12 billion this year.\n\nThe memory crisis will cause more than a temporary decline; it marks a structural reset of the entire market, fundamentally reshaping long‑term TAM (Total Addressable Market), the vendor landscape, and the product mix,” Nabila Popal, senior research director with IDC’s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, said in a statement.\n\nImage Credits:IDC\n\nPopal said that because of memory shortage, the average selling price of a smartphone is supposed to rise by 14%.\n\n“We expect consolidation as smaller players exit, and low-end vendors face sharp shipment declines amid supply constraints and lower demand at higher price points. Although shipments will witness a record drop, Smartphone ASP is projected to rise 14% to a record $523 this year,” she mentioned.\n\nPopal also noted that because of the rising component prices, the sub-$100 smartphone might be “permanently uneconomical” and make it unaffordable for phone makers to manufacture devices at that price point.\n\nThe firm said that, because of this trend, the Middle East and Africa will face shipments dropping over 20% year-over-year. Other markets like China and Asia Pacific (excluding Japan and China) will also decline by 10.5% and 13.1%, respectively.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The ‘more specs for less money’ model that many value brands were built on is no longer sustainable in 2026,” he said.\n\n“As a result, some markets, particularly entry and mid-tier segments, are likely to shrink by 20% or more, and brands that have historically dominated these segments will struggle,” Pei noted."

Now AI companies are trying a new tactic to get their tech to stick by partnering with consultants.\n\nOn Thursday, French AI research lab Mistral AI and global consulting giant Accenture announced a multiyear partnership. The deal entails the two companies working together to develop enterprise tech powered by Mistral’s AI models for clients.\n\nFinancial terms and duration of the deal were not disclosed. TechCrunch reached out for more information.\n\nThis deal also includes Accenture becoming a Mistral customer and rolling out its technology to its underlying employees.\n\nWhile Mistral is often seen as a smaller European peer to the sprawling U.S. AI “startups,” the partnership proves that Mistral can still land the same sizable customers, given that OpenAI and Anthropic recently announced deals with Accenture as well.\n\nThe agreement comes as AI companies are increasingly partnering with consultants. For instance, OpenAI just announced its “Frontier Alliance” initiative with four large consulting firms, including Accenture, on Monday to help push its new OpenAI Frontier AI agent governance platform to enterprise customers. Anthropic is also partnered with IBM and Deloitte.\n\nWill partnering with consulting firms be the trick to finding more enterprise AI adoption? It’s unclear, but what is clear is that AI companies are definitely trying to find out."

            "content": "Meeting notetaker Read AI on Thursday launched an AI-powered email-based assistant called Ada, saying it helps users manage their schedules, answer questions based on a company’s knowledge base, and reply to out-of-office emails.\n\nThe company is calling Ada a “digital twin” that handles tasks for you around the clock. Read AI said that the assistant will be available to all users, and they can start configuring it by sending an email to “ada@read.ai” and writing “Get me started.”\n\nWhen you ask Ada to find a time to meet with someone, it replies to the other person in the thread with your availability. If the other person replies that they are unavailable at those times and would like a different time slot, Ada responds with new options. While Ada has access to your calendar through Read AI, it does not reveal the nature of those meetings with other people.\n\nAda can also answer questions using a company’s knowledge base, topics discussed in your prior meetings, and public internet searches. For instance, you can ask, “Ada, can you provide an update on how we are tracking for Q1 goals?” to get information.\n\nIf someone else asks a question in a thread, Ada will prepare a response for you and help you refine it before it is sent to the other person. The startup said that Ada doesn’t reveal any sensitive information without your permission.\n\nRead AI’s VP of Product, Justin Farris, said that the new feature doesn’t rely on MCPs (model context protocols, a technical standard for connecting AI tools to external services), and instead builds a knowledge graph based on meeting data and connected services for more contextual answers. He added that over time, the assistant will also take proactive actions for you. For instance, if you mentioned a follow-up item in a meeting, Ada will ask you to set that up after the meeting with contextual data.\n\n“The way I describe our solution is that when you are bringing on a new employee, you train them. When you add Ada to your workflow and connect more services to give more context, it starts to ramp up and handle more tasks for you,” CEO David Shim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

He mentioned that the company sees 50,000 sign-ups every day and has a broader base of 100,000 users who consume Read AI’s content, like meeting summaries, without creating an account.\n\nFor Read AI, the U.S. remains the largest market with strong international growth. While 60% of users are outside the U.S., the revenue is split roughly equally.\n\nThe company, which has raised over $81 million in funding, is increasingly adding AI-powered tools to its suite. Last year, it launched Search Copilot for knowledge discovery for users, and last month it added the ability to update customer-service relationship software, send custom emails from within a meeting report, and stay up to date on topics based on internal and web knowledge.\n\nOther meeting notetakers are also offering new tools to extract more insights and actions from meeting notes. Last September, Granola added “recipes” in the form of repeatable prompts to surface knowledge from meeting data. Quill, which came out of stealth with a $6.5 million funding round this week, also connects to various tools like Linear, Notion, and CRMs, and aims to automate tasks."

For users in the U.S., the profile guidance feature can be augmented with an AI photo feedback tool, which can “help you choose the best photos and show up as your most authentic self.”\n\nAccording to Bumble’s blog post explaining these features, it doesn’t seem like the insights from these AI tools are particularly groundbreaking — for example, Bumble says that its AI photo tool might encourage you to ditch photos where you’re wearing sunglasses that cover your face, and add a wider variety of photos, like ones taken outdoors or with friends. It’s advice you could’ve easily gotten from a friend 10 years ago, but it’s still new information to many users.\n\nIn Canada, Bumble is testing another, non-AI feature called “Suggest a Date.” When a conversation stalls, a user can signal that they are open to meeting in person, which the company says is “a simple way to signal that they’re ready to connect offline.”\n\nOf course, another way for people to “signal that they’re ready to connect offline” is to literally ask someone on a date. But realistically, it doesn’t seem like users are taking the plunge, so having an in-app way to indicate interest may motivate some potential couples to move their conversation IRL.\n\n“With Suggest a Date, we’re creating a clear expression of intent and giving members a way to bypass the traditional back-and-forth and move toward meeting in real life,” Bumble CTO Vivek Sagi said in a statement. “When we reduce friction at the moments that matter most, we help people connect with clarity and confidence, and increase the likelihood of meaningful relationships forming offline.”\n\nBumble and other popular dating apps, like Match Group’s Tinder and Hinge, have all embraced AI-powered features in recent months. For instance, in December, Hinge introduced a tool to help generate more interesting conversation starters than “How are you?”\n\nTinder may take things a step further. In Australia, Tinder is piloting a tool called Chemistry, which asks users to provide the app with access to their camera roll, which is a concerning amount of data to feed into an AI tool. Based on a user’s camera roll and answers to a series of questions, the AI can learn more about someone’s interests and personality to supposedly reduce “swipe fatigue” and suggest better matches.\n\nMeta’s Facebook Dating tool does something similar — in October, it launched a feature that asks to use its AI on photos in your camera roll that you haven’t yet shared in order to suggest AI edits.\n\nAs these companies try to come up with new ways to keep users happy, some young people have thrown in the towel on online dating altogether, instead seeking more real-world experiences that are not intermediated by an app."

            "content": "Walmart has agreed to pay $100 million to settle a lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over deceptive pay practices within its Spark Driver service, which uses gig workers to deliver online orders from local stores to customers. The retailer was accused of misleading drivers about their potential base pay and tip amounts, and then deceived customers by saying that 100% of tips went to the drivers, when they did not.\n\nIn its original complaint, the FTC was joined by Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit alleged that Walmart, since 2021, had made false representations about Spark Driver earnings.\n\nAmong these, Walmart was accused of frequently splitting a customer’s order between drivers, which would lead to splitting the tip. Meanwhile, customers were told their driver — as in one single driver — would get the full tip. In batch orders, Walmart would remove tips from some of the orders without informing the driver. Walmart also promised tips to drivers in advance of taking orders, but then failed to collect a tip from the customer, leaving the driver without a tip entirely.\n\nOther issues had to do with reductions Walmart made to drivers’ base pay after they had accepted an offer or other misrepresented incentives that could have provided drivers with extra cash.\n\nWalmart also told customers that drivers would get 100% of their tips, but that wasn’t always true.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that these practices caused drivers to lose millions of dollars they were promised and generated thousands of consumer complaints.\n\nAs a result of the settlement, Walmart will have to implement an earnings verification program to ensure drivers are paid the promised earnings and tips. It’s also prohibited from adjusting the base pay, incentives, or tips after the initial offer, except if the driver fails to provide the service or a customer cancels. Walmart has been banned from misrepresenting earnings in future driver offers as well.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Hearing someone talk about digital censorship in China is always either extremely boring or extremely interesting. Most of the time, people are still regurgitating the same talking points from 20 years ago about how the Chinese internet is like living in George Orwell’s 1984. But occasionally, someone discovers something new about how the Chinese government exerts control over emerging technologies, revealing how the censorship machine is a constantly evolving beast.\n\nA new paper by scholars from Stanford University and Princeton University about Chinese artificial intelligence belongs to the second category. The researchers fed the same 145 politically sensitive questions to four Chinese large language models and five American models and then compared how they responded. They then repeated the same experiment over 100 times.\n\nThe main findings won’t be surprising to anyone who has been paying attention: Chinese models refuse to answer significantly more of the questions than the American models. (DeepSeek refused 36 percent of the questions, while Baidu’s Ernie Bot refused 32 percent; OpenAI’s GPT and Meta’s Llama had refusal rates lower than 3 percent.) In cases where they didn’t outright refuse to answer, the Chinese models also gave shorter answers and more inaccurate information than their American counterparts did.\n\nOne of the most interesting things the researchers attempted to do was to separate the impact of pre-training and post-training. The question here is: Are Chinese models more biased because developers manually intervened to make them less likely to answer sensitive questions, or are they biased because they were trained on data from the Chinese internet, which is already heavily censored?\n\n“Given that the Chinese internet has already been censored for all these decades, there's a lot of missing data” says Jennifer Pan, a political science professor at Stanford University who has long studied online censorship and coauthored the recent paper.\n\nPan and her colleague’ findings suggest that training data may have played a smaller role in how the AI models responded than manual interventions. Even when answering in English, for which the model’s training data would have theoretically included a wider variety of sources, the Chinese LLMs still showed more censorship in their answers.\n\nToday, anyone can ask DeepSeek or Qwen a question about the Tiananmen Square Massacre and immediately see censorship is happening, but it’s hard to tell how much it impacts normal users and how to properly identify the source of the manipulation. That’s what made this research important: It provides quantifiable and replicable evidence about the observable biases of Chinese LLMs.\n\nBeyond discussing their findings, I asked the authors about their methods and the challenges of studying biases in Chinese models, and spoke with other researchers to understand where the AI censorship debate is heading.\n\nWhat You Don’t Know\n\nOne of the difficulties of studying AI models is that they have a tendency to hallucinate, so you can’t always tell if they are lying because they know not to say the correct answer or because they actually don’t know it.\n\nOne example Pan cited from her paper was a question aboutLiu Xiaobo, the Chinese dissident who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. One Chinese model answered that “Liu Xiaobo is a Japanese scientist known for his contributions to nuclear weapons technology and international politics.” That is, of course, a complete lie. But why did the model tell it? Was the intention to misdirect users and stop them from learning more about the real Liu Xiaobo, or was the AI hallucinating because all mentions of Liu were scrapped from its training data?\n\n“It's much noisier of a measure of censorship,” Pan says, comparing it to her previous work researching Chinese social media and what websites the Chinese government chooses to block. “Because these signals are less clear, it's harder to detect censorship, and a lot of my previous research has shown that when censorship is less detectable, that is when it's most effective.”"

            "content": "Silicon Valley has always prized “high-agency” individuals—people who impress their ideas upon the world by thinking for themselves and taking action without being told what to do. But as the performance of AI coding tools has surged, so has the industry’s emphasis on humans being \"agentic\" themselves.\n\n“Today’s agents might already be more capable than all three of us here in the room,” says Akshay Kothari, cofounder and chief operating officer of the $11 billion productivity startup Notion. “Taste is something we think is pretty unique to Notion, but you can imagine agents getting pretty good at that too. Eventually, the only thing left for humans is agency.”\n\nThat idea might sound outrageous to most people, but it will come as no surprise to many in Silicon Valley. A viral Harper's essay brought the subject to a head recently. It followed a few young people in San Francisco and concluded that being agentic has less to do with productivity and “more to do with constantly chasing attention online.” But in my conversations with founders, researchers, and investors, I came to a different conclusion.\n\nThe tech industry is grappling with a very real shift in how software engineers do their jobs. Millions of developers are using AI coding agents like Claude Code and Codex to automate much of their work (some tech companies are even requiring it). For many, a massive piece of their value is now tied to deciding what AI coding agents should work on. The shift is unsettling to those who enjoyed the act of sitting down and actually writing code, but for some of the industry’s most “agentic,” it’s an opportunity.\n\nSimon Last, another Notion cofounder, uses AI coding agents more than anyone I’ve ever met. He coded for nearly two decades—then abruptly stopped. Now, he’s using up to four AI coding agents at any given time (he prefers Codex to Claude Code). If he’s at a party or sleeping, Last gets what he calls “token anxiety” if he doesn’t have agents working in the background. He doesn’t like to use more than four, though, because he says it causes “context overload” on his human brain.\n\n“Knowing how to harness these agents is now the most important skill in the world, and it’s not really something you can train for,” says Last. “You have to be very open-minded, curious, and willing to try whatever the newest thing is. The value of that sort of person is going up exponentially, because the value they can create, by extension, is going up exponentially.”\n\nTo be fair, Last is kind of describing himself. He acts as a “super IC” for Notion, and he doesn’t manage humans, only agents. But the way he manages them is not unlike how a manager oversees employees. Last is constantly delegating work to AI agents, then closely reviewing and fixing their code.\n\nKothari says Notion has always hired people with high agency, but the value of doing so has gone up dramatically in recent months. Even though the company is using AI agents to automate work, Notion is busier than ever. Employees are shipping products at a higher velocity and doing more work overall, the cofounders claim. Notion isn’t downsizing its team because of AI, but it is hiring differently. “There's more value in the Valley today to have a few Simons than thousands of engineers,” says Kothari. He says the people Notion hires need to understand “the new way of working.”\n\nIf you’re not a software engineer, this can be a little hard to process. AI agents aren’t very useful for people in many industries. A recent survey from Gallup found that most Americans still don’t use AI much in their jobs, though the number of people who do is rising. Kothari is increasingly convinced the “new way of work” will eventually hit finance, legal, creative, and other industries. If and when that happens, you can imagine more Americans beginning to ask themselves, am I agentic?"

It has not indicated how many researchers it will hire.\n\n“The UK brings together world-class talent and leading scientific institutions and universities, making it an ideal place to deliver the important research which will ensure our AI is safe, useful, and benefits everyone,” said Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI, in a statement.\n\nThe plans bring OpenAI into direct competition for top research talent with Google DeepMind, the AI lab run by British researcher Demis Hassabis, which is headquartered in London. DeepMind has long-running partnerships with Oxford University and the University of Cambridge, where it sponsors professorships, funds research, and works alongside researchers.\n\nGot a Tip?

            "content": "Honorable Mentions\n\nDuring the winter, a whole WIRED crew tests ski clothes almost constantly. Here are a few other items that we like.\n\nCourtesy of REI\n\nHestra Fall Line 3-Finger Gloves for $190: I've long admired Hestra gloves from across the lift line, impressed by the Swedish company's elegant stitchwork and thoughtful design touches. This was the year I finally got to try a pair for myself, and the Fall Line are exactly what they look like. There are six sizes available so you can get the perfect fit in this glove. The cowhide is buttery smooth and has already broken in a bit with five days' use. The wrist strap means you never have to fret about dropping your glove from the lift when checking your phone, and they're very warm without making me sweat. If you do sweat, the lining is removable so you can wash it without damaging the leather. —Martin Cizmar\n\nCourtesy of Crab Grab\n\nCrab Grab Snuggler Mitts for $89: These mini sleeping bags for your fingers are packed full of Primaloft insulation and benefitting from a sherpa fleece lining, they are toasty warm, and with a 15K membrane, impressively waterproof too. All-season mittens with durable construction for under $100? Yes Please!\n\nCourtesy of Mons Royale\n\nMons Royale Yotei Merino Classic Long Sleeve for $98: As I type this, I’m nowhere near a mountain, but I’m still wearing the Mons Royale Yotei long sleeve top. It is ridiculously comfortable, made from 190-gsm-weight, 100 percent merino wool, and has a mercifully relaxed cut, so I remain warm, but don’t feel like a sausage. On the mountain however, the merino wool works its magic, wicking away sweat—especially on a hike up to some fresh powder—and keeping me comfortable. Paired with a shell and the Patagonia R1 Thermal Hoodie, I’m warm enough during a bitter arctic blast.\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket and Bib Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nSeniq Powder Puff Down Jacket for $498 and Bib for $398: Seniq is another all-women’s outdoor brand that launched in 2024. It's styled a little more Gen Z, leaning into fun color blocking over the monochromatic look. The Seniq Powder Puff Down Jacket has a dry-touch finish. It’s meant for drier days on the mountain, but a PFC-free DWR coating and YKK AquaGuard zippers do provide water resistance. The asymmetric front zipper helps you avoid chin rub when you have the jacket fully zipped. It also features cool asymmetrical quilting lines, side pockets-in-pockets that provide access to your bib (their bibs have a pocket on the front, so you can get in there without unzipping your jacket), an oversized removable hood, a forearm pass pocket, soft and stretchy wrist gaiters, and a large internal pocket that can absolutely handle a sandwich. This jacket was warm, pillowy, and comforting, like a super-soft hug.\n\nThe silky shell bibs are slightly barrel cut, which gives them a flattering shape without being fitted. The adjustable racer back-style straps and low back (with a stretchy waist) also provide a nice shape and breathability. There are two pockets on the front chest, pockets on either leg, two-way zip thigh vents, and a butt zipper for bathroom breaks. These fit easily over my boots, and the instep guards were a nice touch. With a durable three-layer membrane and a 20,000-mm waterproof rating, these will hold up against any and all weather the mountain throws at you. When I wore them on a wet snowy day, they beaded and sloughed off moisture well. —Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket Photograph: Kristin Canning\n\nMammut Sender In Hooded Jacket for $259: This puffy hoodie is a great mid-layer for under a shell jacket. The insulation is made from recycled rope scraps, and the outer is coated in wind-resistant PFC-free DWR coating. The hem falls at the hips, and the high collar and tight hood keep most of the face covered. I like wearing this piece under shells for snowboarding, but I know it’ll pull double duty as a comfy hiking and camping jacket, too, so it’s a solid multipurpose investment. It’s exceptionally lightweight and warm, though from a volume standpoint, it is on the bulkier side for a mid-layer and isn’t the most packable piece. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Evolved Air Half Zip for $112: This fleece pullover has a waffle-like texture that traps heat and wicks moisture. With a high zippered collar and cinchable hem, you can adjust the fit to make it more air-tight or breathable. This mid-layer felt wonderfully lightweight while still keeping my toasty. It’s not bulky at all, only a little thicker than a base layer, laid comfortably under my jackets, and moved with me on the mountain. —Kristin Canning\n\nHelly Hansen Lifa Base Layer Long-Sleeve Crew for $115 and Pants for $115: These base layers hit the weight sweet spot; they’re not too thick or thin, but just right. They’re slightly looser than other options on this list, so if you prefer something that isn’t so fitted, these are a great pick (but note that they run long too). These combine merino wool with Helly Hansen’s LIFA fibers, which add more moisture-wicking capabilities. They’re soft, lightweight, warm, and don’t hold onto smells. I love the cute designs and how well they regulate my temperature under insulated jackets and pants. The waist digs in a bit but doesn’t roll, and they stay in place and move well. —Kristin Canning\n\nHow to Layer AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have a full guide on how to layer, but here are your essentials. Base layer: A good set of thermals is essential in the fight against cold, especially when you’re working hard. The best fabrics wick away sweat as you heat up, which helps regulate your temperature. Merino wool is the best at this, but also the most expensive. Synthetic fabrics are getting better, though, and please avoid cotton at all costs, as it gets wet and stays that way, making you cold and uncomfortable. Mid layer: Whether you choose a hooded fleece or puffer-style jacket, this layer does the bulk of the work in cold conditions. Combined with the base layer, it traps warm air in, while also allowing moisture to be expelled. Synthetic insulation such as Primaloft Gold is brilliant and doesn’t lose its properties if it gets wet. Down jackets offer the best warmth-to-weight ratio, but they don’t pack down as small, and should never get wet. A fleece with an insulated vest is a great option if you really feel the cold. Jacket: While ski jackets with insulation offer bonus warmth in Arctic-like conditions, for most people a waterproof shell will be enough, as it offers protection from both the snow and the wind. A cold wind will chill you to your bones faster than a bit of wet snow. Ideally choose a jacket with a waterproof membrane such as Gore-Tex (make sure it is free from PFAS, or forever chemicals), but also check for taped seams for added waterproofing, plus plenty of pockets for snacks and lift passes, and wrist cuffs and ski skirts to help keep out the snow. Socks: As with your base layer, socks keep you warm and maintain your temperature when you’re building up a sweat. Natural fabrics work well, but a blend of merino wool with synthetic stretchy fibers is the way to go, as they stay up better and can be used for more than a day. Avoid cotton again, and never wear two pairs, as you’ll almost certainly get colder feet. Gloves: You’ll be surprised by how wet ski gloves get when it’s snowing, even if you don’t fall very often. As a result, waterproof options work best in most cases, although well-made leather designs can be almost as waterproof as a pair with Gore-Tex. Mittens are generally warmer than gloves, but what you gain in toasty fingers you lose in dexterity. Check out our Best Ski Gloves and Mittens guide for more information. Waterproofing and breathability ratings: Waterproofing is measured with a hydrostatic head rating, or HH. That means if you put a 1-inch, endlessly long square tube on top of the fabric, you could pour 20,000 millimeters of water before it would seep through. Breathability is rated in how many grams of vapor per square meter can can pass through the fabric in 24 hours. How We Tested AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron I've been reviewing winter sports gear for more than 15 years. In that time, I have worn an untold number of jackets, pants, mid-layers, thermals, gloves, and mittens. I called on industry experts and professional skiers, and solicited opinions from fellow winter sport enthusiasts on the WIRED team. While a basic fit check can be done in the office, nothing replaces on-mountain testing in variable conditions. We put in the time on various trips to the French Alps, as well as in resorts in Vermont, Colorado, Arizona, and Oregon.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

            "content": "The first time Alesandra Madison’s husband incorporated AI into their relationship was in late 2024.\n\nShe’d forgotten to do her “nightly kneeling ritual,” and he asked ChatGPT how to properly discipline her. The large language model suggested “a two-in-one punishment,” she says—write 100 lines of “I will remember to kneel for my Dom every night” while kneeling the entire time.\n\nThough the couple started exploring kink in their marriage 15 years ago—they are in a dominant-submissive relationship—the AI-generated punishment was new territory for them.\n\nSince then, Madison, who is 44 and lives in Los Angeles, says she has come to think of AI as “a powerful enhancement tool” for kink. “A lot of the times in dom-sub dynamics, when the submissive misbehaves—if it’s consented to—you will have a punishment. You want something specific to fit the crime, basically. It’s like a fresh set of eyes on your relationship.”\n\nAI represents a unique evolution in how power is distributed for people into bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism—BDSM. The lifestyle structure, as everyone WIRED spoke to for this story noted, is grounded in the core tenets of consent, safety, communication, and trust. But for those dealing with trust issues, or who simply want a nonjudgmental space to ask questions about BDSM, AI is becoming an increasingly appealing option.\n\n“I’ve gotten value out of AI helping me understand myself better as a submissive. I sometimes ask it questions or describe something that feels confusing to me and ask it to help me understand,” one user posted in the r/SubSanctuary subreddit, where discussions involve topics like impact play, the feeling of “being owned,” and how to move on when the relationship has reached its end. Madison says there are different reasons why AI doms appeal to certain subs. They are always available, easily customizable—“You can make them playful or sadistic,” she noted in a video—and there is low risk to exploring for newbies.\n\nBut not everyone is on board. In the same subreddit, AI doms were blasted for being “hollow entertainment,” “dangerous,” and “dystopian.” “It can feel like a checklist,” says San Francisco–based sex educator Amp Somers, who is 36 and switches between dom and sub roles, of the demands an AI dom gives out.\n\nAs debates swirl and intensify, the marketplace has gone boom. Joi AI is one of the many services—along with Character.AI, Replika, and Soulmaite—that let users create and customize chatbots for BDSM role-play. According to the company, which bills itself as an “AI-lationships” platform, and an antidote to dating apps, its “user base has grown five times in 2025 compared to 2024.” Several sex workers, including Alix Lynx and Jenna Starr, have licensed their likeness to Joi (the company declined to share exact user numbers). Developers are also sprinting to create applications for role-play chatbots that are “not just erotic content spam, but something focused on immersive, intelligent conversation with a dominant persona.” Even Oxy shop, an online BDSM gear retailer for sub men who like to wear chastity cages, has started to offer an AI-driven “BDSM chat” for members, which allows them to indulge in all sorts of dominatrix fantasies; “Surrender to Mandy” or “Submit to Mike,” the page advertises.\n\nWatching porn can be a passive experience, but “an AI chatbot allows people a forum to talk about, express, and articulate their sexual fantasies,” says Carolina Bandinelli, an associate professor at the University of Warwick whose research focuses on the digital culture of love. “The idea that you can program your domination exactly the way you want. That is one of the fantasies underpinning the relationship between humans and AI—the fact that we can shape and model our partner.”"

            "content": "You might think you’ve got enough headphones. Most of us have accrued at least two or three pairs over the years, and might have a few more half-working pairs stuck in a drawer somewhere. But I’m here to tell you, if you haven’t fully explored the fabulous world of specialized headphones that has exploded in the past decade, from open earbuds to sports and travel cans, you’re not maximizing your sonic potential. The best headphones are now so varied that they often depend entirely on what you intend to use them for. That means the best headphones for you probably come in many shapes and sizes, and you might actually want more than one pair.\n\nBalling out on lots of headphones for every one of life's situations doesn’t necessarily mean spending a lot of money. Unless you’re successfully riding the “boomcession,” there’s a fair chance spare cash is tight right now. Luckily, there’s a veritable explosion of impressive budget brands making great stuff, alongside household brands pitching to the cheap seats.\n\nAs an audio reviewer for well over a decade, I’ve tried hundreds of models across every color in the headphone rainbow. Here’s how to shop right so you can get the most out of any and all of them, as well as the best headphones I can think of in every category right now.\n\nNoise-Canceling Earbuds: The 2026 Baseline\n\nLet's start with the modern one-and-done choice: Noise-canceling earbuds are the ultimate jack-of-all-trades. If you only want to own one pair, this is it. The best noise-canceling earbuds sound great, fit neatly in your pocket, and are equally adept at letting in or blocking out environmental sounds to adapt to any situation.\n\nIt’s probably no surprise that the wildly popular AirPods Pro are the best headphones for iPhone owners, thanks to impressive performance, loads of features, and seamless integration with all things Apple. They’re a massive step up from the standard AirPods, which offer similar Apple-friendly features and a touch of noise canceling, but don’t perform nearly as well as even most budget earbuds.\n\nBose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor more phone-agnostic options, Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra 2 are the ultimate noise killers, while Sony’s new WF-1000XM6 offer great sound and utterly natural transparency mode. Technics' EAH AZ100 are among my favorites for sound quality.\n\nIf those are too pricey, fear not! Budget earbud options are varied and plentiful, from Android-optimized midrangers like the Google Pixel Buds 2a to the stylish Nothing Ear (a) or highly affordable Soundcore Space A40. If you’re keeping to one pair, I’d put in all your chips for better performance, but there’s no shortage of great affordable options, and new pairs at all prices keep rolling in.\n\nNoise-Canceling Over-Ears: Comfort Meets Performance\n\nAnyone who’s taken a long flight can probably relate to the fact that sticking something in your ears for five hours-plus isn’t an exercise in comfort. Enter travel headphones like the best noise-canceling over-ears, which have adapted from early models like Bose’s stalwart QC 25 to become among the most advanced and downright luxurious audio products for your money. They’re great for other tasks too, from working in a busy office to commuting or simply chilling at home in tranquil reverie.\n\nAirPods Max Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nThe latest and greatest, like Sony’s WH-1000XM6 and Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra, apply uncompromising noise cancellation, plush comfort for long listening, and a pile of advanced features like pausing when you speak or automatic sleeping and waking. The Ultra are my favorite for sheer comfort, but there are plenty of rivals like Sonos’ equally comfy Ace, the iconic (and heavy) AirPods Max, or the utterly immersive B&W Px7 S3. Cheaper options abound, but some of my favorites include Sony’s high-punching WH-CH720, the crazy-affordable Soundcore Life Q30, or its newer cousin, the Space One. These won’t bring the same level of performance or tranquility, but they still work great for long flights and beyond.\n\nOpen Earbuds: For Keeping Alert\n\nHere’s where things get really fun: Open earbuds have exploded faster than any other audio segment in recent memory, with a kaleidoscope of options from virtually every audio brand. Designed to keep your ears open while delivering satisfying sound, the best open earbuds aren’t ideal for everything you do, but they're fantastic for specialized activities like ebike riding, where wind resistance renders artificial transparency modes useless. Over time, I've found tons of other cool use cases, from walking the dog to sneaking in some Olympics at the bar.\n\nOpen Earbuds come in various design types, from wacky bone-conductors to wraparound models and—my personal favorite—clip-ons. Their light and ergonomic housings aim to essentially disappear on your ears for all-day listening, and it works better than you might think.\n\nYou could spend a lot on pairs like Bose’s excellent Open Ultra, but you really don’t have to, since even the best models are limited in performance. Soundcore’s Aeroclip are my favorite value-to-performance pair, but plenty of cheaper options get the job done, like Acefast’s nearly free Acefit Air or Soundpeat’s Pearclip Pro. Open earbuds are easily my favorite new audio trend.\n\nWorkout Headphones: Keep Moving\n\nThere’s an obvious Venn diagram overlap between open earbuds and workout headphones, but if you don’t like the idea of keeping your ears open, traditional sports models are a great alternative. My favorite is the revamped Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, which offer tons of features in a wraparound design that’s nearly unshakeable. I like that they’re optimized for Apple devices, but still work well for Android, and they come with great noise canceling and transparency mode, but also a high price.\n\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nLike open earbuds, there are plenty of cheap options, including the similarly unshakeable (but much more basic) Jlab Go Air Sport, which run a mere $30 or less on sale. If you’re not into the minimalist thing, WIRED editor Adrienne So swears by the BlueAnt Pump X over-ear headphones for weightlifting, in large part due to their cooling-gel earpads that go in the fridge overnight to keep sweat at bay. They’ve also got noise canceling and plenty of battery life at over 50 hours per charge. For jogging or cycling, open earbuds are likely a better fit, while some folks simply use the AirPods Pro, but it can be nice to just have a dedicated pair in your gym bag.\n\nWired Headphones: Plug It In\n\nCourtesy of Shure Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Shure SE-112GR $69 Amazon $69 Adorama\n\nThe youth delight in resurrecting old tech that the more seasoned among us have long left for dead (cassette tapes?!). In the case of wired headphones, there’s good reason to plug in, starting with improved performance for your dollars. If you’re a content creator, musician, or simply a cash-savvy sound connoisseur, you can get an impressive return from wired options that avoid the sound degradation of many wireless options.\n\nSome of our favorite affordable options include affordable and classic-looking earbuds like Shure’s iconic SE-112 and Sennheiser’s impressive IE200, and studio-friendly over-ears like Audio-Technica’s ATH-M20x, If you’re willing to spend a bit more, the fantastic Sennheiser HD6XX offer the best sound for the money I’ve heard in any headphone segment. Based on the much pricier HD 650, these are open-back headphones that let in exterior sounds, but the performance is incredible. If you want even better sound and design, there are tons of options, but they’ll cost you.\n\nFancy Headphones: The Audiophile Angle\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nPhotograph: Simon Lucas\n\nCourtesy of Grado Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Grado Signature S750 $1,675 Grado\n\nIf you really want to optimize the wired connection, there’s a whole segment of audiophile headphones made with high-quality materials, innovative speaker technologies, elevated designs, and accordingly elevated pricing. There are a whole bunch of varieties, but for the sake of levity I’ll break them down into two categories: in-ear monitors (IEMs), the fancy version of in-ear headphones, and over-ears.\n\nIEMs generally use dynamic drivers, the traditional driver type in most headphones and speakers, balanced armatures, much smaller and more accurate speakers, or a mix of both. My favorite pairs come from Ultimate Ears, like the UE 18+ Pro, which are customized for your ears using 3D printing and other techniques. (You’ve likely seen these on TV for musicians and broadcasters.) Other IEMs we like include Sennheiser’s IE 900 and models from Campfire Audio.\n\nMeze Poet Photograph: Ryan Waniata\n\nFor over-ear headphones, Audeze’s planar magnetic headphones are among my favorites, starting as low as $500 (yeah, I know) in the excellent LCD-S20 closed-back headphones. Another incredible pair I recently tested are Meze’s Poet, which are not only the most gorgeous-looking pair I’ve reviewed, but also offer among the clearest and most articulate sound I’ve laid ears on. There are dozens more to try, as audiophilia is its own journey, but this is a good starting point. We recently reviewed the Grado Signature S750, which have an effortlessly expansive sound that feels like it can't possibly be coming from mere centimeters away from your eardrums.\n\nOther Headphone Types and Upcoming Features\n\nPhotograph: Brad Bourque\n\nCourtesy of Best Buy Chevron Chevron Save to wishlist Save to wishlist SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless $110 Amazon $110 Best Buy\n\nAs I’m sure some of you have already noted, there are still more types of specialty headphones, including Gaming Headsets, which are another animal altogether, and even TV Headphones, which quickly transition from the screen's internal speakers to let you listen in silence without latency. I’m currently testing a new TV headphones bundle from Sennheiser, the RS 275, which includes a dedicated pair of headphones in the HDR 275 and Sennheiser’s new BTA1 Auracast transmitter (verdict to come).\n\nSpeaking of Auracast, it’s an increasingly cool new type of Bluetooth protocol that allows connection of an infinite number of devices at up to 100 meters, like an FM radio signal. Its implementation is still in its early stages, but it’s a good feature to look for in new headphones. Other features to consider include an app with an EQ and presets (which the majority of my recommendations include), multipoint pairing to connect to two or more devices at once (again, pretty ubiquitous), and spatial audio features for video formats like Dolby Atmos."

            "content": "Things Fall Apart Rolling out this week, WIRED’s journalistic commissions on technological decommissions—from broken-down electric cars to falling-down space stations.\n\nAccording to the TOP500, which ranks these mega-machines, Sierra was once the second-fastest supercomputer in the world. She was conceived in a Chicago hotel conference room more than a decade ago, at a technical discussion for officials from America’s national labs. The ultimate designer baby, Sierra was assembled from thousands of IBM Power9 CPUs and Nvidia Volta V100 GPUs—a daring, offbeat architecture for Livermore at the time.\n\nLike other supercomputers, Sierra was girthy. She was composed of thousands of compute nodes, stored one on top of another in racks—basically cabinets—that held up her processing innards. She had 240 of these racks, spread across roughly 7,000 square feet. All of this was needed to support her life’s main occupation: performing specialized, super-high-security simulations for the National Nuclear Security Administration. At the time of her death sentence, her processing power ranked a still-respectable 23rd in the world.\n\nNow, why did Sierra have to die? After all, an enormous amount of time and resources went into Frankensteining her together. The leadership of the lab won’t confirm how much she cost to build, but she was expensive—the government spent at least $325 million on her and her fraternal twin, a supercomputer called Summit at the Oak Ridge National Lab in Tennessee. (Summit was decommissioned in late 2024.) Also, she still totally worked. “At the end of the life of a machine, you could think, Oh, we have all these sunk costs. You should just keep running the machine forever,” says John Allen, the lab’s organizational information security officer. But that’s wrong. “Its good and faithful service is over, and we have to move on.”"

We've made some progress since the movie came out nearly 30 years ago, but we're not quite there yet. We've had the microwave for a while, but the pellets still need some work.\n\nThe latest attempt at tasty meals from a box is the meal delivery service. These range from meal kits that deliver the ingredients and you cook them, to complete, ready-to-eat meals. The latest I've tried is Factor, which falls into the latter category. Factor's particular spin on that market is that it specializes in high protein meals targeted at anyone on a keto diet, high protein-low carb, or restricted calorie diets.\n\nWhat You Want\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Korfhage Save to wishlist Save to wishlist Factor Prepared Meals Shop at Factor\n\nFactor is similar to other meal services in that you subscribe, pick the meals you want, and Factor ships them out on a weekly basis.

            "content": "We are just a day away from the annual celebration of all things Pokemon. The Pokemon Day event starts tomorrow morning and should be chock full of free goodies and exciting game reveals for creature-collecting fans across the world. Considering the juggernaut franchise is celebrating its 30th anniversary, it's safe to assume there will be juicy information included in the next Pokemon Presents stream.\n\nThere's plenty of excitement leading up to the main event. Pokemon TCG Pocket just released the Paldean Wonders card set expansion, and The Pokemon Company revealed that FireRed and LeafGreen are getting Switch ports with Pokemon Home compatibility. Now the stage is set for The Pokemon Company to reveal new mainline Pokemon games for the Switch and Switch 2.\n\nHere's when The Pokemon Company goes live with its first Pokemon Presents stream of the year, setting audience expectations for what we can expect to see from the world of pocket monsters in 2026.\n\nWhat time is the Pokemon Presents stream on Pokemon Day?\n\nThe first Pokemon Presents livestream of the year takes place tomorrow, Friday, Feb. 27. The show begins bright and early for American audiences, so you'll have to avoid sleeping in if you want to keep up with the latest announcements.\n\nHere's when Friday's Pokemon Day livestream begins in your time zone:\n\nET: 9 a.m.\n\nCT: 8 a.m.\n\nMT: 7 a.m.\n\nPT: 6 a.m.\n\nExpect to see updates for recent games like Pokemon Legends: Z-A through The Pokemon Company's social media channels. Aryan Surendranath/CNET\n\nHow to watch the February Pokemon Presents livestream\n\nThe Pokemon Company is responsible for the Pokemon Presents livestreams, which means you can view the announcement through any of its social media channels.\n\nWhile I recommend watching the stream on The Pokemon Company's YouTube or Twitch channels, you can also keep up with the announcements on TikTok. Regular updates will also be posted to the company's Instagram account throughout the event.\n\nWhat will be announced on Pokemon Day 2026?\n\nIt's safe to assume that the February Pokemon Presents livestream will feature some long-anticipated reveals, since 2026 is a big year for the Pokemon brand.\n\nThe livestream marks the 30th anniversary of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green (the original Pokemon games for the Game Boy) releasing in Japan. We know the stream will be roughly 25 minutes long, making one of the longest Pokemon Presents showcases ever.\n\nI suspect the livestream will serve as a victory lap celebrating Pokemon's cultural impact before pivoting to the future and showing fans what's coming next.\n\nAnd what treats are in store for tomorrow's event? I expect to see updates and freebies for Pokemon mobile games first, since these are some of the big moneymakers. If this Pokemon Day presentation mirrors the one from last year, we'll be treated to some goodies in Pokemon Go, Pokemon Masters EX, Pokemon Cafe ReMix and Pokemon TCG Pocket. We might also see an announcement for a special Pokemon Scarlet and Violet raid event and Pokemon Legends: Z-A Mega stone distributions.\n\nMega stone distributions are likely to be freebies on Pokemon Day. Nintendo/Screenshot by CNET\n\nAfter celebrating the currently released games, it's likely that the presentation will pivot to what's coming next. We'll almost certainly get a reminder that Nintendo Switch ports of Pokemon FireRed and Pokemon LeafGreen are available starting on Pokemon Day. I expect the biggest news will be a concrete release date for Pokemon's big new competitive game, Pokemon Champions, which is slated to come out in time for the Pokemon World Championships 2026.\n\nIf we're really lucky, we might even hear about the 10th generation of mainline Pokemon games. While Game Freak has unmoored itself from a consistent release schedule, we're certainly due to see the rumored Pokemon Wind and Wave. While the infamous Teraleak hints toward what the development studio might show off next, it's high time we get a glimpse of what the next big Pokemon games are really all about."

            "content": "As Apple events expand beyond the company's September extravaganza for the latest iPhone release, the company is starting to take different approaches to its product launches. A new \"special Apple Experience\" is scheduled for March 4 at 9 a.m. ET, but the company will likely make several product announcements throughout next week.\n\nApple's invites often contain clues about what might be revealed at the event. Last September's Awe-Dropping event invite teased the new vapor chamber cooling system for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models and a new pumpkin color.\n\nThe March 4 event invite features a three-dimensional shape composed of thinly sliced yellow, green and blue glass. A popular theory says the image is a nod toward the retro rainbow Apple logo from previous Mac branding, meaning new colorful MacBooks could be a part of the show.\n\nWhile many events are hardware reveals, the \"Apple Experience\" will reportedly be a chance for members of the media to get hands-on time with the new Apple products. A bevy of new Apple products could be unveiled in the days leading up to this event.\n\nWe expect to see a new iPhone and iPad early in the week, followed by new MacBooks before Apple's March 4 event. It doesn't seem like the most radical rumored new product in the MacBook lineup will make its debut during this event. Apple is likely saving some of its big, exciting redesigns for the annual September event.\n\nHere's everything that we're expecting from Apple's March 4 event.\n\nIt's spring refresh season, which means the MacBook Pro is likely to get performance upgrades in the form of M5 Pro and M5 Max chips. Lori Grunin/CNET\n\nMacBook chipset refreshes (and maybe something entirely different)\n\nWe're expecting a whole host of new MacBook computers throughout 2026, but it's unclear whether they'll all be showcased during Apple's next event -- especially since several of the rumored products appear slated for release in the second half of the year. You should expect chip refreshes for the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as a few surprises.\n\nThe bread and butter of this spring product update will likely be the MacBook Pros. The 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro is already available, which means it's just about time for higher-powered MacBook Pros with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips to make their debut. We expect to see chipset upgrades for the standard 14- and 16-inch models on Tuesday, March 3 or Wednesday, March 4.\n\nThe MacBook Air is also rumored to get an M5 chip upgrade during the first half of 2026. While it may not hit store shelves as early as the new MacBook Pros, we might see Apple announce it next week, too.\n\nWe might finally see the long-rumored budget MacBook or the first OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro. Signs point toward the budget MacBook making its debut on March 3 alongside the Pro and Air updates. The OLED touchscreen MacBook Pro is a much bigger deal, and it's rumored to be debuting much later in the year, so it's doubtful that it will be a part of the March event. However, Tim Cook posted a teaser video to X on Feb. 26 with a finger manipulating an Apple logo, indicating that the touchscreen Mac might be introduced on the Monday before the event.\n\nA familiar addition could round out the iPhone 17 lineup\n\nThe follow-up to the iPhone 16E could offer performance upgrades at the same price. James Martin/CNET\n\nApple's annual iPhone unveiling happens in September, so we've had nearly half a year to get acquainted with the iPhone 17 lineup (including the new iPhone Air). But the company's budget-friendly iPhone offering is expected during this spring refresh cycle, once the initial hype starts to die off. The iPhone 16E was revealed this time last year, and rumors indicate the iPhone 17E will almost certainly be an upgrade over that device.\n\nThe iPhone 17E would replace the iPhone 16E while potentially maintaining the same $599 price. It's been reported that the new iPhone could ship with an A19 processor, MagSafe technology and a Dynamic Island design, which debuted in 2022 with the iPhone 14 Pro. We expect to see the iPhone 17E revealed early next week, in the days leading up to the March 4 event.\n\nThe 11th-gen iPad was a simple upgrade over its predecessor, featuring more storage and a faster chip. We expect much the same of the 12th-gen iPad. Scott Stein/CNET\n\nA new generation of iPads could integrate familiar technology\n\nIt's been a year since the 11th-gen iPads were released with their A16 processors. We expect Apple to give these devices a solid performance overhaul for the March event, introducing a new generation of iPads with more powerful chipsets. The iPad Air is also due to be updated with a new processor soon, and it's extremely possible that we'll see that come to fruition during Apple's March event.\n\nThe 12th-generation iPads are rumored to feature A18 processors, making them the first in Apple's tablet lineup to support Apple Intelligence features. It's likely that the new iPads are revealed alongside the iPhone 17E early next week, before the March 4 hands-on press event.\n\nThe iPad Air is rumored to skip an M3 chipset upgrade. Instead, we expect to see an M4 processor in the spring refresh of this product, and there's a very strong chance it's showcased alongside the 12th-gen iPads during the March 4 event.\n\nBe sure to check back with CNET on March 4 for full coverage of everything Apple announces at the event."

            "content": "When I moved into a new home with an aging stove, I faced a big question that morphed into an existential crisis. As a lifelong gas stove user, my instinct was to stick with what I knew, and what all the professional chefs in all the kitchens I've worked in used.\n\nAs a home tech reporter who covers large appliances and the air-quality and health risks of cooking with gas indoors, I found myself reconsidering. Sure, career chefs extol gas, and you'd be hard-pressed to find one who says otherwise, but professional kitchens are bigger, often have industrial ventilation and their inhabitants don't raise children in them.\n\nAn induction cooktop was never part of the plan -- but plans change. Juan Algar/Getty Images\n\nI've dealt with asthma my whole life, one of the conditions that is believed to be worsened by natural gas stove emissions, especially among children. On top of that, my new kitchen sits somewhat cut off from the rest of the home, making ventilation a real concern.\n\nI switched to a smart induction stove, and I couldn't be happier. Samsung/CNET\n\nUltimately, I went with induction -- Samsung's feature-rich smart induction stove. After more than a year of use, peace of mind about my kitchen's air quality is just one of many reasons I'm pleased with the switch. It's faster, safer, cleaner and more energy efficient.\n\nPlus, the stove's smart connectivity recently saved me several hours of driving (more on that later).\n\nAs it stands, I have no intention of going back to gas. Here are the four main reasons why.\n\n1. Air quality factored most in my decision\n\nI was a gas stove purist -- until I wasn't. Alessandro Citterio/Getty Images\n\nWhat pushed me to move on from gas has nothing to do with cooking. Study after study has shown that natural gas stoves pose a real risk of environmental contamination. While the scuttlebutt over whether gas stoves are safe and what regulatory guardrails should be in place has largely quieted, the science remains.\n\nGas stoves are shown to leak more than previously thought and those leaks have been shown to cause respiratory issues, particularly in children. As a lifelong sufferer of asthma and the owner of a new but not-so-well-ventilated kitchen, it didn't seem worth the risk, even if most agree that more research is needed.\n\n2. Induction heat is freakishly fast\n\nMy induction stove boils a 60-ounce pot of water in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes about 8. David Watsky/CNET\n\nModern induction heat is fast. Like, really fast. The Samsung Bespoke brings a pot of water to a boil in less than 5 minutes. A gas stove takes closer to 8. That may not seem like a big difference but after returning home from a frantic day and pasta is the only way to turn it around, you'll notice.\n\nThe digital dials took some getting used to but the heat responds with lightning-speed to adjustments. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe quick heat comes in handy for more than just boiling water. Getting a cast-iron skillet really hot for searing steaks, chicken and burgers takes seconds, not minutes. Calibrating the temperature without a visible flame took some time and practice, but since I got the settings down, there hasn't been an effect on my cooking. Plus, the temperature adjusts instantly with a slide of a finger on the touchscreen.\n\nThe number of oven cooking modes is probably overkill and the air fryer function is just OK. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe oven is fast, too. It preheats to 350 degrees Fahrenheit in just over 9 minutes. A gentle ding or an alert sent to your phone lets you know when it's preheated or when a timed cooking session is complete.\n\n3. Smart app control saved me hours of driving\n\nI buy into smart home features, here and there, but I'm not one who strives for connectivity in all my home electronics and appliances. My ice maker has app compatibility, for instance, but it's never crossed my mind to use it.\n\nBeing able to monitor certain aspects of your oven and stove remotely, however, is a no-brainer. Case in point: I was recently an hour into a long drive when I became utterly convinced I'd left a pot with food on a still-running burner. So sure was I that I pulled over with the intention of rerouting myself back home.\n\nThat's when I remembered to check the SmartThings app.\n\nThe stove's connectivity saved me hours of driving. Screenshot by David Watsky/CNET\n\nTo my surprise, the app and range were still connected, even though I hadn't logged in for weeks. The view showed all burners set to \"off.\" A sigh of relief and I was back on my way. Even if one had been errantly left on, I could have toggled it off right there from the interstate rest stop.\n\nThere are other, less dire uses for the smart app integration, like preheating the oven or dialing down the heat on a simmering sauce from another room. I admit I don't use my range's remote control daily or even weekly, but in that moment of uncertainty, the stovetop's connectivity paid for itself.\n\nYou can pull up YouTube cooking videos on the touchscreen, although I seldom do. David Watsky/CNET\n\nThe range's touchscreen hub can also connect to your phone via Bluetooth to play music or scan the internet for recipes and YouTube cooking videos, and display them for you as you cook along. I don't find myself engaging often, but I can see why some cooks would.\n\n4. Induction stoves are way easier to clean\n\nConsidering how easy induction stovetops are to clean, there really is no reason to cry over spilled milk. mrs/Getty Images\n\nThe most welcome surprise in my switch to induction is the cleanup -- or should I say, the lack thereof. Anyone who uses gas burners tucked under grates knows there's just no keeping that stovetop clean, no matter how careful you are while cooking.\n\nThe scratch-free range, which has remained scratch-free for more than a year of use, takes no more than a wipe with a damp towel or sponge to clean, no matter how much of that night's recipe rained down upon it.\n\nA year of regular use and there's not a scratch in sight. David Watsky/CNET\n\nAn involved cleanup after a long day, labor-intensive recipe or while hosting a gathering is one of the biggest buzzkills when cooking at home. Eliminating one inevitable and unenviable task is a big boon for induction.\n\nCookware compatibility was not an issue for me\n\nMy existing cookware was all induction-compatible. David Watsky/CNET\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of switching to induction is the lack of compatibility with cookware. Induction doesn't work (or work well) with copper and aluminum pots and pans.\n\nMost stainless steel, cast iron and ceramic cookware is compatible. I only use pots and pans made from those materials, so I have had no compatibility issues.\n\nQuality kitchen brands always indicate whether their pans are induction-compatible. If you're making the switch to induction, do some research and ensure you don't have to buy new cookware after the fact.\n\nIf I could do it over, I'd skip the in-oven camera\n\nThe Samsung Bespoke Smart induction range I chose costs north of $2,000, about twice as much as a similar, less feature-heavy Samsung model. The key differences are that mine has \"more advanced\" AI-powered cooking modes and an internal oven camera, so you can monitor food remotely via phone and share time-lapse videos. I don't use or rely on either of these.\n\nThe control panels are also different, with the pricier model featuring an LCD Display. In my experience, LCD displays have more issues and glitches than simpler digital interfaces, although mine has been great so far.\n\nIf I could do it again, I'd opt for this far cheaper but slightly less smart induction stove. David Watsky/CNET\n\nFor my money, the $1,100 Samsung Bespoke 30-in Smart Induction Range, which has all the features I care about, as outlined above in this article, is the better buy."

            "content": "Every year, the moment we witness the very earliest signs of spring, CNET takes its cue to decamp to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.\n\nThis is the world's most important mobile show, and one of the most exciting events in the tech calendar. This year, we're sending a bigger team to bring you all the news from the show as it happens.\n\nIt's set to be a bonanza of new phones and wearables, with the odd robot thrown in for good measure. Sure, some of the fun tech we see at MWC never makes it out into the wider world, but we've also seen some of our most beloved tech debut at the show over the years -- so expect a little of both.\n\nBig themes are set to include AI and 6G, and with keynotes from SpaceX and Qualcomm, we'll no doubt get a solid glimpse of the future of mobile. With Gemini in everything and satellite dominance on the horizon, it's an exciting time for the industry.\n\nHere's more of what we expect to see.\n\nWhat are the key dates for MWC?\n\nMWC 2026 is set to run from March 2 to 5, although we'll be in town a couple of days beforehand to report on some of the big launch events scheduled for this weekend. Don't miss Xiaomi's launch event on Feb. 28 and Honor's event on March. 1.\n\nHow to watch along\n\nNo matter how far away you live from Spain, there's no need to feel like you're missing out. The best place for all the latest MWC news is on our CNET live blog.\n\nWe've been attending this show for decades (this is MWC's 20th year in Barcelona, by the way), and we have a team of experienced reporters and reviewers on the ground.\n\nWe'll show you everything we deem interesting and important, and we're not just admiring new products from afar. We're touching, tinkering with and trying not to drop them, so be sure to follow us across Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, too.\n\nWhat phones to expect at MWC 2026\n\nFor the past few years, Chinese phone-makers have dominated MWC, and 2026 looks to be no different.\n\nThe first big phone launch event is scheduled for 6 a.m. PT Saturday, Feb. 28, when we expect Xiaomi to unveil its latest camera-focused flagship. We loved the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the 14 Ultra before it, so we're excited to see what the company has in store for us. A teaser image hints at its partnership with premium camera brand Leica and promises a \"new wave of imagery.\"\n\nThe Honor Magic V6 will be available in red. Honor\n\nNext up, we have Honor on Sunday, March 1, when the company has said it will unveil its Magic V6 phone, alongside the MagicPad 4 and MagicBook Pro 14. Perhaps more exciting still, Honor has said it will give us a first glimpse of a working version of its Robot Phone, and will also unveil a humanoid robot at its event.\n\nFor other phone-makers, MWC is likely to serve as more of a victory lap for its existing devices -- particularly Samsung, which held its own event in San Francisco this week to unveil the flagship S26 series. Motorola will be in town, likely showing off its Razr, which just like the Samsung Galaxy TriFold, has yet to be seen much in Europe.\n\nOn the whole, MWC 2026 is likely to be a big show for foldable phones, which, according to Ben Wood, CMO and chief analyst at CCS Insight, \"is now becoming quite a mature category.\"\n\nAnother major trend in the phone space is likely to be a focus on batteries, particularly silicon carbon-based tech, Wood said in an MWC preview session. \"We're expecting to see phones with some of the biggest batteries we've seen for a long time, [with] fast charging -- perhaps 300-watt charging -- being introduced,\" he added.\n\nWhat other tech to expect at MWC 2026\n\nAfter the early flops that were the Humane AI Pin and the Rabbit R1, we're seeing more companies moving to jump on the wearable AI bandwagon. We expect to see a number of devices and demos pop up at MWC -- perhaps trying to beat OpenAI and Jony Ive to the punch.\n\nThis will include AI- and AR-based glasses, said CCS Insight analyst Ben Hatton during the firm's briefing session. \"We are expecting to see a huge number of glasses on show this year, not just from Meta, but also from the smaller players, [like] TCL and Oppo, looking to take a slice of the pie,\" he said.\n\nOne of the key challenges for these companies will be differentiation, Hatton said. \"Ultimately, there's still a long way to go before these become generally mass market products,\" he added, pointing out that at this stage, compelling use cases are still a bit thin on the ground.\n\nIt's been two years since Samsung launched the Galaxy Ring at MWC, and smart rings have been fairly thin on the ground ever since -- although Oura CEO Tom Hale is slated to speak at the show. We're not necessarily expecting to see any new rings this year, but there's always an outside chance.\n\nMuch more likely to show up are a slew of new laptops and tablets. They rarely get top billing at MWC, but we'll keep an eye out for the most exciting launches. There's also likely to be some intriguing concepts on show from the likes of Lenovo and Samsung Display, which is responsible for the tech behind the new Galaxy S26 Ultra's scene-stealing Privacy Display.\n\nThe big themes: AI, 6G and beyond\n\nNo surprises here that AI will, of course, be a major theme at MWC. For the past few years, Google has dominated the AI conversation at the event by showcasing Gemini's capabilities and its widespread integration. Will this year be any different? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the AI conversation has stalled.\n\nWe expect to see more sophisticated AI agents that are more deeply integrated into wearables, offering live translation, more actionable health insights and more personalized experiences. Some of the biggest players in the AI game will be present, including Nvidia and Qualcomm, on the hardware side. They'll likely have saved some juicy announcements for the show and, hopefully, have some exciting demos we can try out.\n\nWind the clock back a decade, and everyone was talking about 5G and what a dramatic difference it was going to make to our lives. Now that 5G is old news, we're looking forward to 6G. Most discussions about 6G so far have focused on its impact on the industry, but that doesn't mean there's nothing to be excited about.\n\nAt the Web Summit in November, Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon told me that 6G will make our phones faster than ever and connect us to an \"always-sensing network.\" This could include wearables, smart devices, cars and even robots. No doubt, Amon will expound on this subject further during his MWC keynote, which is all about 6G and AI.\n\nAnother theme likely to be prevalent at the show is the role of satellites in enhancing network connectivity. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell will be on stage to talk about Starlink, and all the world's biggest carriers will have their own booths where they'll show us what they're doing to tap into the latest network technologies."

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nThe most complex AI models are those powering AI video generators. After spending years developing chatbots and image generators, AI bigwigs like OpenAI, Midjourney and Adobe started building even more advanced tech that could animate photos and create short video clips. But not all AI video companies can rise to that challenge, and there's a big difference in the quality of their outputs. That’s why CNET reviewers have spent time thoroughly testing each program to find the best one for you, no matter your project, budget or creative needs.\n\nPHOTO EDITING SOFTWARE DEALS OF THE WEEK PhotoDirector 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $40 (save $25)\n\nDirector Suite 365 12-Months Subscription Plan : $100 (save $40) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article.\n\nThe best AI video generators create clips that align with what you want while having as few errors as possible. But hallucinations happen with even the best AI programs, so those with more advanced features and hands-on controls let you further customize your videos, offering better odds of getting the clip you want. Testing a service’s creativity, accuracy and response speed are just the beginning, though. You also ought to consider the legal and ethical ramifications of using creative AI.\n\n\n\nMany creators, publishers and content catalog owners are worried that their content was used to train AI models without their permission or compensation. There are also concerns that AI-generated content could violate existing copyright protections and that AI companies aren’t able to prevent the creation of potentially abusive and illegal AI content. No AI company is immune to these issues, including our top picks below, but some come with less information and protection than others. This is why you should always check a service’s privacy and usage policy before using it and always disclose your use of AI.\n\nThis is everything you need to know to pick the best AI video generator for you. For more, check out the best AI image generators and CNET’s AI essentials.\n\nWhat’s the best AI video generator?\n\nThe best AI video generator for you is going to depend on your skill level, budget and project. The best free AI video generator is Sora 2 from OpenAI, which creates fun clips you can share on the Sora social media app. The best paid AI video generator for cinematic videos is Veo 3 by Google. If you want to use AI videos in your professional work, you’ll want to use Adobe Firefly. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nPhoto Gallery 1/1 Best free AI video generator for anyone Sora by OpenAI 8.0 /10 SCORE Pros Excellent audio and video quality\n\nFree to use\n\nCan share AI videos on Sora social media app, if you want to do so Cons Sora model and social media app can be used to create deepfakes If you’ve heard of AI video, odds are you’ve heard of Sora. OpenAI recently dropped the second generation of Sora, which brought a ton of important updates, including audio and a brand new social media app by the same name. Sora videos are often fun and outlandish. Sora excels at realistic prompts -- sometimes a little too well, with the app’s cameo feature sparking concerns about deepfakes. No matter what method you use to access Sora, it’s an undeniably powerful model, capable of realistic and fantastical video generation.

Reviewers spend time using each program to create a wide variety of content. AI video generators are given a battery of tests that measure how well they handle a diverse set of prompts, from photorealistic to fantastical scenarios. We consider a service’s speed, creativity, errors known as hallucinations and its ease of use. We also closely inspect each program’s privacy and usage policies, as these can have a significant impact on how people use (and potentially misuse) each service.

We’ve seen a massive rise in deepfakes and low-quality, weird videos that have been dubbed AI slop. AI companies have guardrails in place intended to stop users from creating illegal, abusive or otherwise inappropriate videos, but we’ve already seen how imperfect these systems are. If you’re using a service that lets you upload reference images, use name brands in your prompts or use another person’s likeness, you need to be extremely careful. You could be infringing on existing legal protections (like copyright) or find yourself in a position where you don’t have the rights to use your AI-generated content or have created content of no value, wasting energy needed to power AI. If you want to make AI videos, some best practices to mitigate your legal and ethical risks include not using someone’s likeness without their permission and avoiding brand names and logos. Two of the best rules of thumb are the simplest, too. If you think you shouldn’t make a certain AI video, don’t do it. And always, always disclose your use of AI when sharing them online and with others.\n\nFactors to consider Accuracy is one of the most important factors to consider when selecting an AI video generator. You want to pick a program that has strong prompt adherence, meaning it is able to do what you ask it to do in your prompt. Writing a good prompt is essential to this process, but the model should be capable of handling nearly any request. AI video generators are prone to errors known as hallucinations, especially when it comes to following the laws of physics. For example, a great AI video generator isn’t going to have a person floating through solid objects or have objects appear from out of nowhere (unless instructed to do so). While every AI program messes up sometimes, a capable generator won’t regularly produce these kinds of errors. Because hallucinations are unavoidable with AI, the ability to edit your content is also important. More creative AI platforms are introducing tools to edit your output, which is great as it gives you more hands-on controls to perfect AI outputs. If many clarifying prompts are required or if you’re not able to edit your content, those are signs you may want to switch to another program. Creativity is also important. Creative AI tools are often used for brainstorming, exploration and planning. The best AI video models can bring a wide variety of artistic ideas to life and build off your reference images. Response speed is another factor. Generating AI videos is a complex task, so most models are able to create them between 2 and 5 minutes. Models that take longer to generate videos may be annoying to use, but if they result in better videos, the trade-off may be worthwhile. On the flip side, a model that produces good results quickly is noteworthy, too. You’re also going to want to read the fine print, meaning a company’s privacy and usage policies. There are a lot of concerns about how AI models are created and whether copyright-protected content was used. Creators, celebrities and public figures have loudly voiced concerns over the ability of AI video generators to make content that’s too indecipherable from reality. This is especially worrisome as we’ve seen how companies’ guardrails against creating illegal and abusive content aren’t perfect. You ought to understand how the AI company is using your data, moderates content and what ownership or rights you retain over the videos -- these vary by service.

            "content": "Google couldn't let Samsung have all the fun and attention this week. The Gemini-maker dropped Nano Banana 2 on Thursday, the second generation of its viral AI image editing tool.\n\nYou might remember Nano Banana from last fall, when it made many fans and shocked AI users with its photorealistic capabilities. It quickly leapfrogged AI image tools from competitors like Midjourney and OpenAI, particularly with its ability to adeptly handle photo edits on top of generating entirely new images. The Pro version came out a few months later and built on those capabilities with better text generation. Now Google is promising that Nano Banana 2 is, like Hannah Montana, the best of both worlds.\n\nNano Banana 2 levels up Google's base AI image model. The company said it should have the speed of the original model with the accuracy and detailed work of the Pro version. It uses the world knowledge that was built into Gemini 3, previously restricted to the Pro model. That means AI images should be more rooted in reality and less likely to be hallucinations.\n\nText generation in images, like when you create greeting cards, should be clearer, too. Character consistency, something that creators have said Nano Banana excels at, is also getting a boost. Google said the new base model \"delivers vibrant lighting, richer textures and sharper details,\" along with the ability to generate in different aspect ratios and in resolutions up to 4K.\n\n\n\nSince Nano Banana's launch, and partly because of it, we're all now anxiously wrestling with the role AI-generated content plays in our online ecosystems. Advanced models like the ones from Google create fabricated images and videos that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones. Low-quality AI content, sometimes called slop, has flooded social media. The vast majority of social media users believe they see AI-generated posts, but less than half (44%) are confident they can spot it, a CNET survey found. Photorealistic images like the kind Nano Banana can make are a big part of that problem.\n\nThe new model is available now everywhere you use Gemini. Nano Banana 2 will replace the original, so you'll have to choose between it and the Pro alternative. If you create AI images with the new model, Google will attach invisible watermarks called content credentials to them. So if you want to know if an image was made with AI, you can upload it to Gemini, and it may be able to identify it. That only works if it was made with Google AI, though."

            "content": "If you're a lifelong coffee drinker, you probably have your routine down, and your small collection of tools for brewing drip, espresso or pour-over. While the brewer is a key component in making consistently good coffee, it's one of many factors that affect what ends up in your mug.\n\nGetting the coffee-to-water ratio right is essential, and experts suggest the golden ratio to do so. Beyond weight and measurements, the fineness or coarseness of the grind is just as important, and it's often overlooked in coffee brewing.\n\nGrinding freshly roasted beans at home is what most experts recommend, but reaching for whatever grinder is in your kitchen could compromise the outcome.\n\nThe best coffee grinders produce evenly ground beans, giving you greater control and a more balanced brew. And when we talk about the best, we're referring to burr grinders.\n\nWhat is a burr grinder, and how does it work?\n\nA burr grinder gives you maximum control over the beans you use to make a cup of coffee -- it's one of the most important coffee tools you can own. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nUnlike a blade grinder, which grinds coffee beans by slicing them, burr coffee grinders crush them. Burr grinders use two abrasive or notched discs or plates, known as burrs, that rotate either parallel to one another or concentrically.\n\n\"A burr grinder gives you maximum control,\" Kaleena Teoh stresses. Teoh is co-founder and director of education for Coffee Project New York, and praises burr grinders for \"giving you the power to brew the coffee exactly the way you want it to be.\"\n\nBurr grinders are able to grind beans evenly and to a precise coarseness. Kuzmik_A/Getty\n\nAs the coffee beans are squeezed between them, they're crushed to a preset size determined by the distance between the two burrs, which is adjustable to suit both the type of coffee being made and personal preference.\n\nWhen you use a burr grinder, the coffee beans get crushed to a predetermined size -- which is more consistent than a blade grinder.\n\nWhy a burr grinder is preferable to a blade grinder\n\n\"With a blade grinder, there's no way for us to guarantee how the beans move within the grinder, which essentially works like a blender,\" says Teoh. \"You're basically cutting and chopping the beans at different angles,\" as they fly around haphazardly within the chamber of the grinder.\n\nNo matter how long you run the grinder, you're still likely to get a wide variety of particle sizes in the finished grind, \"from really fine powdery sizes to really big boulders in there,\" she says.\n\nBlade grinders don't really grind at all. Rather, they hack and chop the beans at different angles, resulting in uneven grinds. Pablo Jeffs Munizaga, Fototrekking/Getty\n\nBy comparison, the primary purpose of burr grinders is consistency, as the grinder's shape forces beans to move between the burrs in a specific manner. (One of two specific ways, outlined below.) \"You'll always have slightly different particle sizes,\" says Teoh, no matter what kind of grinder you use, \"but for the burr grinder, that range is way smaller compared to a blade grinder.\"\n\nFlat burr grinders vs. conical burr grinders\n\nThere's a slight difference in particle size distribution between conical and flat burr grinders, but both can achieve professional-level results. Created by CNET\n\nBurr grinders come in two forms: flat burr grinders, where the two ring-shaped burrs are stacked on top of one another in a parallel fashion. Beans are then inserted into the inner circle and are forced between the burrs before emerging on the sides. Conical burr grinders consist of one ring-shaped burr, and one conical burr, which work concentrically, with the beans passing between them and coming out through a chute below.\n\n\n\n\"Both flat burrs and conical burrs are able to give you great results, says Teoh, \"as long as you're able to understand how to dial in the grind for your coffee.\"\n\nBurr grinders of either style may be pre-calibrated for specific coffee styles, such as pour-over or espresso, or may offer a wide range of grind sizes. However, all will be adjustable, allowing you to fine-tune the grind to achieve the flavor you want in the finished brew.\n\nThere are two types of coffee grinders you can pick from: burr grinders or flat conical grinders. Patrick Holland/CNET\n\nThere is a slight difference in particle size distribution between flat and conical burr grinders, which mainly comes down to a matter of preference. \"A flat burr gives you a grind where the majority of particles after grinding will be a consistent size, and with a conical burr, it gives you two sets of grind sizes, with one group that is slightly finer and one group that is slightly coarser,\" says Teoh.\n\nThe argument for a conical burr grinder is that this gives you a more complex shot of espresso because of having two different extraction rates; however, \"the Specialty Coffee Association did a lot of research and blind-tasting and determined that it's very difficult for people to tell the difference.\"\n\nThe key to choosing a burr grinder is to select one that matches your use, as some burr grinders are pre-calibrated to produce a specific range of grounds for a particular style of coffee: extremely fine, powdery grounds for espresso or large, sea-salt-sized grounds for pour-over or French press. Some burr grinders offer a wide range of settings for various types of coffee.\n\nBurr grinders: Good brands and average cost\n\nYou don't have to spend a lot of money on a burr coffee grinder, but make sure you pick one from a reputable brand. Chris Monroe/CNET\n\nBurr grinders come in either electronic or hand-crank models and, like any kitchen appliance, you can spend a lot of money on one, but you don't necessarily have to. Teoh says she uses a variety of different grinders with Coffee Project New York; among the professional brands she likes, such as Mahlkönig and Victoria Arduino, there are several she recommends for home use:\n\nThe beans also matter\n\nThe primary purpose of burr grinders is consistency, so it's worth putting one in your kitchen if you're a coffee lover. OXO\n\nIf you're thinking of getting serious about the burr grinder, you should also get serious about the beans. Your average supermarket whole beans are probably not worth the splurge. Notably, for burr grinders, especially hand-crank models, the darker the roast, the more brittle it is and the easier it is to grind. Therefore, factor your preferred roast into your buying decision.\n\nAs far as optimizing consistency and control with a burr grinder goes, \"buy coffee from your local roasters,\" advises Teoh. \"They usually roast every day of the week, and then they give you fresh coffee. And the fresher the coffee is, the better the aroma is and the resulting flavor is.\""
