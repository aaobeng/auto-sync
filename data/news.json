            "content": "ARSENAL and Manchester City hero Bacary Sagna’s son has joined a club in the United Arab Emirates belonging to City Football Group.\n\nSagna, 43, experienced an impressive seven-year stint with the Gunners where he won the FA Cup in 2014 before leaving the Emirates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former full-back moved to Premier League rivals City where he lifted the League Cup in 2016 during a three-year spell at the Etihad.\n\nThe 65-cap ex-France international’s son Elias is now following in his footsteps.\n\nElias, 17, recently joined Al-Jazira, which belongs in the same group as his father’s former club Man City.\n\nAnd Bacary is adamant that the young winger, currently playing with the likes of Nabil Fekir and former Arsenal ace Mohamed Elneny, will become a massive success while he continues mentoring him.\n\nThe Frenchman also teased that Elias might play for England as he is eligible for the Three Lions as well as France, Senegal and UAE.\n\nBacary told Ladbrokes at the launch of Ladisfaction: “My kids are playing football out here [in Dubai], and my eldest has just started playing professionally for a club, Al-Jazira, which is a club from the Manchester City Group.\n\n\n\n“He’s about to turn 17, but he’s doing really well and I’m trying to give him as much support as I can.\n\n“He’s started playing for the UAE national team – he’s eligible to play for them because he’s been here for five years. But he could also represent England, Senegal and France.\n\n“He’s a winger, and then I have another son who is a bit younger but who is also doing great. He’s left-footed, so I might have one on one wing, and one on the other in a few years.\n\n“The best education I can pass on to my kids is my behaviour towards other people. You know, they are smart, and they’ve been in this world for a long time.\n\n“They are great kids, and they’re in a safe environment out here, which is the most important thing for me. They have a lot of qualities on the pitch though, and you might discover them soon.\n\n\n\n“I’m talking mainly about my eldest, because of the position he’s currently in. He’s very, very good, and fast. Super fast. He might not have the hair I had when I was a player, his is a bit more like [Joshua] Zirkzee.\n\n“Obviously I played in the MLS a few years ago, and at that time, my son stopped playing football and got into hockey for two years. He got back into it when we came to Dubai.\n\n“He likes challenges, and he’s surprised me with how far he’s come already, really. He’s very competitive, he wants to destroy other kids in one-on-ones. When the pressure is released off him, he’s so confident.\n\n“My slight worry was that he was doing very well, but we’re in Dubai. But then he got scouted by Al-Jazira, and now he’s comfortable around the professional players.\n\n“He’s playing with Nabil Fekir, also, so he’s in a great position right now. He’s a real talent, honestly. He needs to keep working, though. He’s been training with a professional team for three months now.\n\n\n\n‘He has all of the ingredients’\n\n“He’s had experience with playing for the national team out here, and there is a youth World Cup where he could play for the UAE, or maybe France or England… I don’t know.\n\n“But he’s so talented. I’m not just saying that because he’s my son, but he’s a real talent. He’s fearless, he’s confident, he’s fast and very athletic. He’s a tall kid, too.\n\n“He has all of the ingredients to become a good player – I just have to make sure he works properly, and this is where I step in as his dad.\n\n“I keep reminding him, he hasn’t done anything yet. There’s still a long way to go in his career.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Like I said, all of the ingredients are there, but I say to him all of the time, you have no idea how good it is, but also how fast you can lose it all if you don’t take care of yourself, and stay disciplined.\n\n\n\n“Every morning, I talk to him about hard work, dedication and work ethic, and I hope he can go on to have a good career in the game.”"

Who is in those positions now, probably Bournemouth, Brighton?\n\n“So I don’t feel the need to just go and do it to say I’ve managed in the Premier League.\n\n“I’ve had one of the biggest jobs in world football so I’ve been spoiled. Huge nights, working with outstanding players. No owner interfering.\n\n“The bit that, externally, people are saying is, ‘well, he didn’t win’. So how do you prove that you can win? You’ve got to one of those big clubs.\n\nBEST FREE BETS AND BETTING SIGN UP OFFERS\n\n“Now we know those big clubs… do I think I could have done the job that some people who have been in those clubs recently have done? Could I do better? I think I could.\n\n\n\n“But we’ve talked about the baggage that comes with me as an appointment if you’re an owner.\n\n“And there’s a reality around (that), I can understand what that noise is. There’s that bit which makes me potentially a complicated appointment for a club.”\n\nSouthgate said he needed a break after eight years as Three Lions chief which “consumed everything” and had a “higher purpose” as it was for his country.\n\nThe ex-Crystal Palace and Aston Villa star added: “I don’t want to go and manage a different national team. Club? It’s honestly not what I’m looking to do.\n\n“Now, two years after leaving England, I’m not actively looking for a role in coaching. If that European final was the bit (in coaching) I wouldn’t worry about that.\n\n\n\n“Because there is another 15-20 years of my life ahead of me and I’m excited about a different video, a different movie, a different part of my life.”"

The UEFA presenter apologised for \"embarrassing\" his counterpart with the well-wishes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe draw was just concluding when Pinto attempted to wish Marchetti a special day. Except he got his numbers mixed up, which made for an awkward few seconds on stage.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"That'll do it for us at the house of football, fantastic to have Ivan [Rakitic] here,\" said Pinto to his guests. \"Well done as always, Giorgio.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"It's a special day because it's the last day of the UEFA Champions League season, also because it's Giorgio's birthday. So, I'm sorry to embarrass you, but I think he deserves a round of applause. I think it's 49, right Giorgio?\"\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\nHowever, Marchetti quickly responded \"less\" as he tried to laugh off the awkwardness. Former Barcelona and Croatia midfielder Rakitic was an unwilling bystander as the exchange drew to a conclusion, and he was likely as relieved as anyone to see the back-and-forth draw to a close.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHaving been made aware of his mistake, Pinto appeared as keen as anyone to move on.

The Old Trafford icon confirmed on Thursday he has bought a 25 per cent stake in Spanish side Almeria.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIt signals the start of a new era for the 41-year-old, whose own playing career is still very much alive at Al-Nassr. However, the building blocks are already being put in place for what lies in store when he leaves the Saudi Pro League.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn fact, one could say Ronaldo has been laying the framework for his segue into club ownership for some years now. At least, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has made little secret of his intentions to invest once his own days on the field are done.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAnd there's a fine chance that road may lead back to United if Ronaldo gets his way. Mirror Football takes a look back through every subtle (and some not-so-subtle) nod and hint Ronaldo has given that suggest he's bound for a United takeover one day.\n\nEnsure our latest sport headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n'Fixing' United comments\n\nIn typical Ronaldo fashion, the forward has already gone on record to say he can be the man to lift United out of the post-Sir Alex Ferguson haze. Of course, he was unable to do so during an ill-fated second spell as a player, which ended in 2022, but he has since made a fairly big claim about taking the Red Devils back to the glory days as investor.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's Man Utd hint and huge net worth revealed after he buys stake in club READ MORE :\n\nCristiano Ronaldo sent transfer request after buying 25 per cent stake in club READ MORE :\n\nSpeaking at the 2024 Dubai Globe Soccer Awards, Ronaldo suggested he would get everything in order if it was him calling the shots as United owner. \"The problem of Manchester United is the same.\n\n\"The problem is not always the coach. It's much more than that. If I will be the owner of the club, I will make things clear and adjust things that are bad there.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's tenure as minority stakeholder does appear to finally be yielding some fruit with Michael Carrick in charge of the squad. Admittedly, however, there's a long way to go before the club is back to the heights it resided at during Ronaldo's first stint under Ferguson.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Many a United fan might love the idea of having Ronaldo making the decisions at Old Trafford (Image: Maja Hitij - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images)\n\nOwnership milestone\n\nThis week's news that Ronaldo was investing in Almeria potentially presents a significant moment for the sport as a whole. Not purely because of the name now attached to the club's board, but because of the clarity it provides for a post-Ronaldo era.\n\nThe more invested someone like Ronaldo is in an idea, the easier he'll find it to bid farewell to his first love of playing football. What's more, it's easy to envision that while this may be his 'toe-dip' moment as an owner, it may not be long before his portfolio expands exponentially.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn a press release via his company, CR7 Sports Investments, he said: \"It has been a long-time ambition of mine to contribute to football beyond the pitch...I look forward to working alongside the leadership team to support the club’s next phase of growth.\"\n\nFOLLOW OUR MAN UTD FB PAGE! Latest United news and more on our dedicated Facebook page\n\nRonaldo is but the latest major sports figure or retired athlete to purchase a stake in a Spanish club. Namesake Ronaldo Nazario is the owner of second-tier side Real Valladolid, while ex-NBA stars Steve Nash and Steve Kerr are shareholders in Mallorca.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe transition may not be instant, but success with one investment will likely only lead to more. And while buying a piece of the United pie might not be realistic right now, it's inevitable that will be considered one of, if not the ultimate end goal.\n\nCriticism of the Glazers\n\n\"Anything you can do, I can do better.\" It wouldn't be Cristiano Ronaldo if there wasn't some part of his brain that felt that way in most areas, and the Glazer family is no different.\n\nThere were issues at United during Ronaldo's first tenure, though Ferguson managed to make hay despite the fact. However, it only became clearer as to just how deep-set some of these problems are, and Ronaldo was only too happy to point them out as his second stay at Old Trafford came to an explosive end.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Ronaldo didn't hold back in his stance on the Glazer family during an explosive 2022 interview (Image: @PiersUncensored/Twitter)\n\n\"The Glazers, they don’t care about the club,\" he said during a 2022 interview with Piers Morgan, which unsurprisingly led to another departure. \"Manchester is a marketing club. They will get money from the marketing—the sport, they don’t really care, in my opinion.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just squad investment where Ronaldo felt funds were lacking. He also criticised the club's failure to upgrade certain facilities since his first stint at the club, which ended more than a decade prior in 2009.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" he said when referring to the club's gym, catering and pool facilities. And United clearly concurred on some level given renovations to those same facilities were some of the chief priorities after Jim Ratcliffe's arrival at the club in 2024 to take charge of football operations.\n\nOwnership ambitions\n\nDespite what some might think concerning his potential to be a manager, Ronaldo has long been clear he wasn't interested in that side of the sport. However, he's been candid regarding a potential avenue in ownership for some time now.\n\nSky Sports discounted Premier League and EFL package This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

No,\" he said at the Globe Soccer Awards in December 2024. \"But maybe I could become a club owner.\"\n\nFor anyone in doubt as to whether he'd be able to afford moving in that direction, Ronaldo's finances are unparalleled among current of former footballers. At least that's according to Bloomberg, which reported in 2025 that the Portuguese sensation had become football's first legitimate billionaire.\n\nIt was back in 2023 that Ronaldo said: \"I don't rule out becoming a club owner. It's something I thought about a few years back. I probably would like to own a [football] club. I'm at the end of my career, two to three years maximum.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIt's now been three years since he made those comments, and the goal has been realised. Knowing Ronaldo's insatiable appetite, however, the objective won't be truly fulfilled until he's in control of a club truly close to his heart."

The forward has been linked with potential switches to both Manchester United and Arsenal.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRecent reports suggest that Arsenal have moved ahead in the race for the former Everton man. Asked about that speculation, Newcastle boss Howe has admitted that he is powerless to stop rumours but believes Gordon will not be affected by talk over his future.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nSpeaking in a press conference ahead of this weekend’s clash vs Gordon’s former club Everton, he said: “I'm not sure there's a lot I can do about that.

In this age there's always rumour and speculation.\n\n\"I don't see probably 90 per cent of it, I'm sure the players probably see more than I do. But I think it comes with the territory of being a top player and playing at this level, that there's going to be speculation.\n\n\"I think you've just got to put it out of your brain and you've got to focus on the football, because as we know with our schedule, there's so many games, there's no time for distractions.

If the players absorb it and it affects them then of course that's a negative. But I think they will become robust enough to ignore it and concentrate on playing.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"And I think these things only come into focus really when windows are open, and that's for me when the player should be, if at all, thinking about their futures.

Make no mistake, the ‘Premflix’ TV channel is coming to you, sooner or later.\n\nIt might be as early as 2029, when the current £6.7billion domestic deal with Sky Sports and TNT Sports comes to an end. But whenever ‘Premflix’ hits our screens, one of the first questions that will be asked is … what took them so long?\n\nThe streaming arrangement with Singapore company StarHub means all 380 games will be shown live on a special channel, Premier League +. The channel will also have magazine content.\n\nPremier League slammed over Man City 115 charges verdict delay as La Liga chief lets rip READ MORE :\n\nMAKE THE MIRROR YOUR FIRST CHOICE! Click here to activate or add us as Preferred Source in your Google search settings\n\n“We have now taken control of our content. It allows us to look differently in the future,” Richard Masters, the Premier League’s chief executive, told the FT Live Business of Football summit.\n\nAnd it does not take a leap of imagination to envisage how ‘differently’ televised Premier League football in the United Kingdom will look in the not-too-distant future. The organisation’s own streaming service might run alongside a TV deal with Sky, or whoever, but you can be almost certain of one thing.\n\nWe will not go into the next decade with an arrangement that means not every Premier League game is available to watch as it happens. The Americans who own Premier League clubs will surely see to that.\n\nView 4 Images The Premier League's current domestic TV deal is up for renewal in 2029 (Image: George Wood/Getty Images)\n\nView 4 Images Sky Sports is the main broadcaster of the Premier League but can only show a limited number of matches live (Image: PA)\n\nFundamentally, it is an insult to the passion and commitment of fans of clubs throughout the entire football pyramid to suggest they would not go and support their team if Bournemouth v Brentford was being shown on the telly at the same time. And with respect to those two teams, it would, generally, be Bournemouth v Brentford, or sides of a similar ilk.\n\nThe big TV guns - Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal - are needed for prime time as it stands right now. You can see a point in the future when they never play at 3pm on a Saturday. It would be another mighty blow to the tradition and history of football on these shores but since when has that been a concern of Premier League club owners?\n\nView 4 Images Richard Masters has given no indication of the 3pm blackout being up for discussion (Image: Sky Sports/NBC Sports)\n\nThey are, as a rule, successful business people and, whether you like it or not, they have a product that is in phenomenal demand at home and abroad. For elements of that product to be unavailable to watch live is a glaring anomaly in 21st century sports broadcasting.\n\nAnd don’t worry about the clubs in the Championship, in Leagues One and Two, in the National League and in all the leagues below. Their loyalty will not even be remotely tested by Bournemouth v Brentford on Premflix at 3pm on a Saturday.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

            "content": "Manchester City will face Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League, as Chelsea were drawn against holders Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nChelsea could have been handed an all-English last-16 tie against Newcastle, but Eddie Howe's side will face Spanish champions Barcelona.\n\nPremier League leaders Arsenal, who topped the Champions League table with a perfect record, face German side Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nSix-time winners Liverpool take on Galatasaray, while Tottenham have been handed a tie against Atletico Madrid.\n\nThis is the fifth consecutive season Man City and 15-time winners Real Madrid have been drawn in the Champions League knockouts.\n\nThe last-16 first legs take place on March 10 and 11, with the second legs scheduled for March 17 and 18. The schedule is expected to be released on Friday night.\n\nMan City, Liverpool and Chelsea have been placed in what appears to be the hardest side of the draw.\n\nWere City to progress past Real Madrid, they will face either Bayern Munich or Atalanta in the quarter-finals, while Chelsea and Liverpool will meet in the last eight if they knock out PSG and Galatasaray respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Arsenal will play either Bodo/Glimt or Sporting if they beat Leverkusen. Were they to reach the semi-finals, Arsenal's opponents will be Newcastle, Barcelona, Atletico or Tottenham.\n\nAnalysis: A favourable draw for Arsenal?\n\nA trip to Germany awaits for Arsenal as they face Bayer Leverkusen for the first time since a 4-1 win in 2002. Win that tie, and it's Bodo Glimt or Sporting next. It's a favourable draw, especially given the alternative was a potential quarter-final against Manchester City.\n\nIt's only two years since Leverkusen won the Bundesliga under Xabi Alonso but they are no longer the same team. Having finished second last season, they now sit sixth, with Kaspur Hjulmand at the helm after Erik ten Hag's brief spell in charge ended in September.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Arne Slot has them in better shape ahead of their next meeting.\n\nThe Reds have avoided a last 16 tie against Atletico Madrid but their route to the final, beyond the meeting with Galatasaray, for which they will be strong favourites, looks daunting, with Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich potentially standing in their way.\n\nBefore that, though, it's a potentially awkward trip to Turkey, and a reminder that any side containing Victor Osimhen has to be taken seriously.\n\nMonterosa Monterosa , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

He kept on nicely when winning at Kempton last time and must have a strong chance despite another 3lb rise.\n\nFerrous was successful in this race last year under same pilot Tom Marquand. That was off a 10lb lower mark however and he will need to be at his best if he is to follow up. An excellent fourth behind subsequent winner Diligent Harry in the Kachy Stakes showed he is in rude health though.\n\nThe best of the rest may be Kevin Philippart de Foy's Lakers. He finished an excellent third from a wide draw in a strong race at Southwell and must be respected if in similar mood.\n\n3.00 Newbury - Miami Magic headlines strong novices' chase\n\nMiami Magic tops a quality line-up for the OLBG 'Chasing Excellence' Novices' Chase at Newbury.\n\nStuart Edmunds' stable star impressed when getting off the mark at the third time of asking at Cheltenham on his penultimate run. He struggled to land a blow in the Scilly Isles Novices' Chase at Sandown but given he did not jump with the same fluency, he should appreciate the drop down in class and is taken to concede the penalty under Charlie Hammond.\n\nWyenot has been a consistent performer for the Henry Daly team and has undergone a wind operation having disappointed at Bangor. Providing that is a success, she could bounce back and rates next best.\n\nThat's Nice, Elysian Knight and Thank You Ma'am complete the quintet.\n\n2.12 Lingfield - In-form Henrythenate and Mr Juggles clash\n\nAn ultra-competitive renewal of the Betmgm Awc 3 Year Old Trial Handicap where in-form pair Henrythenate and Mr Juggles headline.\n\nHenrythenate made it two wins from two for new trainer Stuart Williams when comfortably winning over five furlongs at Wolverhampton 15 days ago and he looks the type to go in again as he steps up in trip to six furlongs.\n\nMick Appleby's Mr Juggles was well-backed when making a winning handicap debut at Southwell earlier this month and he warrants plenty of respect under a 7lb penalty.\n\nOthers with each-way chances are Star Of Albion and Saffron Dandy, while Horace Wallace makes appeal on his first handicap start.\n\nBest of the rest\n\n3.45 Lingfield - AW Marathon Trial - Last year's winner Roaring Legend involved. Enemy another to note.\n\n4.20 Lingfield - AW Middle Distance Trial - Duke's Command fancied for Marquand. Lord Melbourne too.\n\n4.53 Lingfield - AW Mile Trial - Superposition among 10 runners.\n\n2.42 Lingfield - AW Fillies & Mares Trial - Bridget's View tops a field of 11.\n\n3.35 Newbury - Taunton winner Talk To The Man catches the eye for Paul Nicholls.\n\n4.08 Newbury - Fair handicap chase where Carbon Man and Daytime Dreaming feature.\n\n2.30 Newbury - Lady Cecilia is a potential improver for Lucy Wadham.\n\n6.15 Wolverhampton - Charlie Appleby and Conor Planas team up with well-bred Starglow. He is related to Romantic Style.\n\n5.45 Wolverhampton - Benacre and Maximising have claims.\n\n12.25 Chantilly - Vatican will be popular.\n\n1.00 Chantilly - Keep an eye on Turbulante."

I think in general it makes no sense to speak too much about the other side, we have to focus on ourselves. “We want to win this game.

The Egypt international has won the Golden Boot four times since arriving at Anfield in 2017, the latest in last season’s title-winning campaign but has gone nine league matches without finding the net. It’s his worst run in the English top flight but Slot said while the criticism was to be expected because of the 33-year-old’s high standards it was not a cause for a concern as it was a problem afflicting all his forwards. “He set his own standards and those are so high and the moment he doesn’t score for a few games people are immediately surprised – that is the biggest compliment he can get,” said Slot. “With data you can use it to your advantage or disadvantage but not to use the FA Cup game – if we play a Premier League side - you could argue if that is fair. “Three games ago he had an assist and a goal against a very good Premier League team in Brighton so that is the reality and then you can change data and say he did not score in nine Premier League games. We are used to Mo scoring a lot of goals and at this moment in time that is maybe the biggest difference in his performance and game time. But we also know this has happened before, I don’t know if it happened nine games in a row but I’ve had these questions earlier if he didn’t score for three or five but I know in the end he always starts scoring again. He is not our only attacker at this moment in time that doesn’t score as much as we are used to.” [Press Association] Share\n\n2h ago 05.24 EST Football Association news: Kevin Thelwell has been appointed the FA’s Elite Coach Developer, tasked with supporting the progression of elite homegrown coaches.

Arne Slot has opened his pre-match presser by telling reporters that Florian Wirtz will not be fit for the game and there’s no confirmed time frame on the German’s return. Wirtz missed Liverpool’s somewhat fortuitous win against Nottingham Forest last weekend after being forced to pull out during the warm-up. “I don’t expect Florian to be available,” he says. “It’s a disappointment. Every time a player is not available is a disappointment, it’s something that I didn’t expect after last week. At this moment time, I don’t know [when he will return]. Usually when I say that, I do know and I don’t want to share. But this time, I honestly don’t know. “It’s a big accomplishment for Wirtz to stay fit for such a long time because he had to make a step up from where he played to the Premier League and Liverpool. It tells a lot about his mentality and work rate that he has stayed fit for so long. It is a disappointment for him and for us, because he has played really, really well lately” Slot also reveals that Jeremie Frimpong will be available for tomorrow’s match after being sidelined since the end of January.

            "content": "Liverpool had the highest wage bill in the Premier League when winning their 20th league title last season, the club’s latest set of accounts have revealed.\n\nLiverpool’s wage bill increased by £42m to £428m in the year ending 31 May 2025, when a Premier League title triumph in Arne Slot’s debut season as head coach and a return to the Champions League increased revenue to a record £703m. The club’s wages-to-revenue ratio stood at a healthy 61%. It was the biggest wage bill in the division, ahead of Manchester City on £408m, and included bonuses for the record-equalling title triumph.\n\nCommercial revenue increased by £15m to £323m and matchday revenue by £14m to £116m. The figures contributed to an increase of £89m in revenue for the highest-ranked Premier League club in the Deloitte Football Money League. But the rise in wages, which pushed administrative costs up by £57m to £657m, resulted in a relatively modest post-tax profit of £8m. Liverpool had a £57m loss in 2023-24 after failing to qualify for the Champions League.\n\n“We make no secret of our desire to run and operate a financially sustainable club, to grow revenue streams, and to do all we can off the pitch to help bring more success on it,” said Liverpool’s chief financial officer, Jenny Beacham. “The 2024-25 season is a great example of how this can work, with record revenues alongside the men’s team winning our 20th league title.\n\n“The club does face significant cost challenges, including rises in administrative, staffing and operational costs, alongside the need for us to compete at the highest level of the game, across our men and women’s teams.”\n\nLiverpool’s latest set of published accounts do not include last summer’s record spend of almost £450m on new players, including the British record signing of Alexander Isak for £125m from Newcastle. Slot said recently that failure to qualify for the Champions League would be unacceptable for Liverpool this season and the competition “does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run”.\n\nOn Friday Slot insisted it was not difficult to resist the clamour to start Rio Ngumoha because the level-headed teenager had not been carried away by the hype.\n\nView image in fullscreen Rio Ngumoha made a big impact for Liverpool from the bench against Nottingham Forest. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA\n\nThe 17-year-old made a huge contribution to Liverpool’s late win at Nottingham Forest last weekend after his 77th minute introduction, especially after switching wings to replace Mohamed Salah on the right. That has prompted calls for Ngumoha to start against West Ham on Saturday, when Florian Wirtz will again be absent through injury, but Slot will continue to develop the youngster carefully.\n\n“It’s totally not difficult because of how he is,” Slot said on putting Ngumoha on the bench. “And that is something special for a 17-year-old who has been hyped like he is throughout his whole career.\n\n“There has been a lot of talk about him because we can all see how special he is and his talent. He is handling that situation really well, which is a big compliment to him but also to his parents, who raised him that he is down-to-earth, works really hard, keeps going and doesn’t lose his head because a few pundits have given positive feedback about his game. If you start believing how special you are after a few comments from pundits, that is probably not the way to become the player he wants to become.\n\n“We have to keep his special quality and that is beating players in one-v-one. That is not 10 out of 10 times working, and it doesn’t have to be, but he has to keep trying. There are not many players in modern football that can take on one-v-ones on a regular basis and beat their opponents a lot of times. That is a special quality and that is why we want to take such good care of him because we have a lot of belief in how special he is.”"

            "content": "Nottingham Forest have appointed a new director of performance, Tottenham’s former head of medicine and sports science Geoff Scott, amid concerns that injury problems have exacerbated their struggle to avoid relegation.\n\nScott spent 20 years at Tottenham until leaving two years ago after a clash with the then manager, Ange Postecoglou, who was in charge of Forest for eight matches this season.\n\nVítor Pereira was this month appointed Forest’s fourth manager of a turbulent campaign, and his side are two points above the bottom three before Sunday’s trip to Brighton.\n\nForest’s struggles have not been helped by injuries, with 19 players ruled out at some stage, one of the worst records in the Premier League. Only Tottenham, Chelsea and Arsenal have had more injuries, and those clubs have deeper squads.\n\nScott will take charge of an overhauled medical department, with the existing head of medical, Dr Prithish Narayan, understood to be leaving to return to work for the NHS.\n\nScott left Tottenham at the start of last season as part of a major restructure of Postecoglou’s backroom team, which led to the appointment of Adam Brett from Brighton as Spurs’ director of performance services. It was widely reported at the time that Scott had clashed with Postecoglou over the players’ workload and management of their recovery, with Tottenham declining to comment.\n\nTottenham’s squad has been devastated by injuries for the last two seasons under Postecoglou and Thomas Frank, with the club experiencing 41 injuries last season leading to 1,553 days out, the second-highest total in the Premier League after Brighton."

            "content": "Two months ago, Aston Villa were just three points off top spot in the Premier League. They were on a run of 12 wins in 14 games that included victories against Manchester City and Arsenal. Their run of eight consecutive wins in the league was their best since they won 10 in a row in 1910. You wouldn’t have blamed Villa fans for daring to dream about lifting their first league title since 1981.\n\nBut success breeds expectation, and expectation carries its own cruel weight. Arsenal tore Villa apart in a 4-1 win in late December and victories have been hard to come by in the new year – they have only won three of their last nine league games. Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea are still below them in the table but the gap is narrowing. With games against United and Chelsea coming in March, the top-three spot Villa have occupied since they beat Wolves in late November suddenly looks in jeopardy. So does their place in the Champions League next season.\n\nThey salvaged a point against Leeds on Saturday courtesy of a scrambled 88th-minute finish from Tammy Abraham, but the 1-1 draw at Villa Park did little to disguise the deeper issues. Unai Emery’s side looked anxious and lacked inspiration for long periods of the game. A slow start left them chasing the game and, not for the first time this season, they relied on a set-piece goal to bail them out of trouble. “It’s a good point,” said a clearly relieved Emery. Daniel Farke’s reaction was telling. “It’s crazy that you can come here as a newly promoted side – to one of the title contenders, one of the best teams in this country and in Europe – and you are slightly disappointed with just one point.”\n\nThe tension from the fans in Villa Park mirrored the hesitancy on the pitch – a rarity in what has been one of Europe’s most difficult venues to visit in recent years. Villa lost just one home game in the league last season and were on a run of eight straight wins at Villa Park this season before their current slump. And yet they were just minutes away from their fourth defeat in their last six home games in all competitions. For a side that has thrived on controlled possession, high-quality chance creation and adaptability, they looked one-dimensional and mistake-prone.\n\nVilla are lacking a creative pulse and their strikers are suffering. They have scored just one goal from open play in their last five matches. Injuries have had a large part to play in this. Three of their first-choice midfielders – Boubacar Kamara, Youri Tielemans and John McGinn – are out injured.\n\nTielemans and McGinn have set up 50 chances for teammates this season (only Morgan Rogers has been more creative) so it’s no surprise to see Villa struggle for goals. Without the physicality and control of their absent midfielders, Villa’s buildup play has been fractured and mistakes have crept in. Their replacements, Douglas Luiz and Amadou Onana, were injured earlier in the season and lack the match fitness required to complete games.\n\nView image in fullscreen Aston Villa have missed John McGinn, their captain, during his injury layoff. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA\n\nThe good news for Villa fans is that they have battled back from similar setbacks in the recent past. They failed to score a goal or win a point from their first four league matches this season yet were fighting for the title by Christmas.\n\nAnd they had to show plenty of character the last time they qualified for the Champions League, in the 2023–24 season. They were challenging for the title at Christmas, having lost just two of their first 18 games. But they struggled in the second half of the campaign, lost seven matches and found them themselves grinding out results. That team held on and finished fourth, booking their place in Europe’s top competition for the first time since the 1982-83 season.\n\nVilla are showing similar grit this season. After Abraham’s last-gasp equaliser against Leeds, Villa have won 19 points from losing positions – more than any other side in the division. They also have the third best defensive record, having conceded just 28 goals in 27 games. And they have one of the most experienced and shrewdest managers in Europe.\n\nIt’s also worth remembering that the Premier League is unusually competitive this season. The longest current winning streak in the league is just three matches (Manchester City). All of the top teams – even leaders Arsenal – have gone through periods when they have dug in. Villa’s resilience could prove decisive. Their recent draws against Crystal Palace, Bournemouth and Leeds might feel like missed opportunities, but those points may prove crucial come May.\n\nMarch will be a season-defining month for Villa. Their recent form is patchy and their performances have been far from eye-catching. Fluidity in possession has given way to forced passes, and dominance has often been replaced by moments of desperation. But there remains a steel to this side that cannot be ignored. And, crucially given their upcoming games against their fellow Champions League chasers, they have a nice habit of beating the top sides. They have already beaten Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the league this season. There are plenty of reasons to go into the run-in with optimism.\n\nThis is an article by WhoScored"

            "content": "1 Emery seeks to end Wolves duck\n\nUnai Emery has seen most things in this game but he has never won at Wolves. In three and a half years at Villa, he has lost two and drawn one of his three games at Molineux. Twelve months ago they lost this fixture 2-0 and this week Emery shared his poor record to stress the difficulty of the challenge facing his side, particularly given they have won just one of their past five matches in all competitions. Emery even mentioned his visit to Wolverhampton with Arsenal in 2019, when his team trailed 3-0 at half-time and lost 3-1. For Emery, there is no better time to break his duck, with the schedule dictating that Villa could move nine points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea, who visit Villa on Wednesday, before Liam Rosenior’s side travel to Arsenal on Sunday. Victory would enhance Villa’s chances of returning to the Champions League but also pile pressure on direct rivals. Ben Fisher\n\nWolves v Aston Villa, Friday 8pm (all kick-offs GMT)\n\n2 Xhaka’s return can lift Black Cats\n\nThese teams are heading in opposite directions: Bournemouth are unbeaten in seven, while Sunderland have won twice in the same period and lost their past three games. One key reason for the Black Cats’ slide is that their captain, Granit Xhaka, missed four games through injury, only returning to the bench in the most recent defeat, to Fulham. The central midfielder has been instrumental in helping Régis Le Bris’s side to the verge of safety and they have lacked his experience and influence in recent weeks. He managed half an hour on Sunday and it feels necessary to reinstate him to the starting lineup. Considering how well Bournemouth are playing, Sunderland will need a disruptor to not let them settle and allow his own side to rediscover the rhythm that’s made them a surprise package this season. Will Unwin\n\nBournemouth v Sunderland, Saturday 12.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Back in business: Granit Xhaka looks set to give Sunderland a timely boost. Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA\n\n3 A first Burnley start for Ward-Prowse?\n\nIf there was one thing James Ward-Prowse can do even when not 100% match fit, it is deliver a superb set piece. The former England midfielder is yet to start in the Premier League since joining from West Ham in January but showed his worth in the draw at Chelsea, where it was his corner that landed perfectly on Zian Flemming’s head to earn a late point. The Clarets have not looked particularly dangerous from set pieces this season and having Ward-Prowse among their limited weaponry will be advantageous in the final stages of the season, even if the club are heading for relegation. It feels vital that Scott Parker should start him at the weekend, a reward for his cameo at Stamford Bridge, where he was also the man fouled for Wesley Fofana’s second booking, having beaten the Chelsea man to the ball. Ward-Prowse may have drifted into the shadows in recent years but he has plenty to offer still. WU\n\nBurnley v Brentford, Saturday 3pm\n\n4 Liverpool launch sign language initiative\n\nA welcome initiative is taking place before Liverpool’s game against West Ham, designated the club’s “Red Together” match. According to research conducted by Liverpool’s commercial partner Carlsberg, 81% of deaf and hard-of-hearing fans feel unable to participate in matchday chants with 74% of those affected feeling disconnected from the stadium atmosphere. In response, and in conjunction with the British Deaf Association, Liverpool fans are being asked to perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” in British Sign Language (BSL) as they sing the club’s anthem before kick-off. BSL interpreters will be in operation at every subsequent home match and bar staff at Anfield are being trained in basic sign language to help combat the exclusion that deaf and hard-of-hearing fans experience on a matchday. Anyone wishing to join in can find a useful video guide here. Andy Hunter\n\nLiverpool v West Ham, Saturday 3pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Liverpool fans sing You’ll Never Walk Alone before kick-off at Anfield. Photograph: Lewis Storey/Getty Images\n\n5 Centre stage for Gordon against old club\n\nNewcastle may be in the last 16 of the Champions League but they are also 11th in the Premier League, two places and one point behind Saturday’s visitors to St James’ Park, Everton. “We’ve raised our game at times in the Champions League, there’s no denying that,” says Eddie Howe. “But we want to get into Europe every season and we’re desperate to get our Premier League form back on track. We’ve been inconsistent and we need to find a remedy.” With Manchester United (fourth and 12 points ahead of Howe’s team) visiting Tyneside on Wednesday night these two impending home league fixtures offer Newcastle an ideal opportunity to revive their latterly receding top-six ambitions. On Saturday much may depend on Anthony Gordon’s performance against his former club. Can Howe’s left-winger turned centre-forward outwit his old teammate Jordan Pickford in the visiting goal? As a former Sunderland goalkeeper, Pickford always relishes clean sheets kept at St James’ and will be anxious to avenge Everton’s 4-1 league defeat on Merseyside in November. Louise Taylor\n\nNewcastle v Everton, Saturday 3pm\n\n6 Farke and Guardiola’s pals act\n\nBack in November, Leeds were 2-0 down at Manchester City at half-time in a Premier League match many pundits predicted might be Daniel Farke’s last in charge. By full time the score was 3-2 to City. An interval switch to a back three and the introduction of Dominic Calvert-Lewin had prompted a Leeds revival. The Elland Road board offered Farke the benefit of the doubt and his team continue to be much improved. “We’re growing into the Premier League,” said the German, who welcomes his good friend Pep Guardiola to West Yorkshire on Saturday. “Behind the scenes we have a pretty close relationship,” explained Farke. “Pep’s the best manager in the world; he always evolves and develops ahead of the wave. He played false 9s and inverted full-backs before anyone had heard of them.” With relegation a lingering worry, Farke will temporarily forget his bond with Guardiola as he aims to collect at least four points from home games against title-chasing City and Tuesday’s visitors, Sunderland. Louise Taylor\n\nLeeds v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm\n\nView image in fullscreen Daniel Farke will be hoping for more celebration as Manchester City come to Elland Road. Photograph: Bruce Rollinson/PA\n\n7 Hürzeler seeks home approval from fans\n\nGiven supporters were calling for his head after their insipid defeat by Crystal Palace the last time Brighton played at home, Fabian Hürzeler will be relieved that last week’s victory at Brentford has eased some concerns over relegation. Struggling Nottingham Forest’s visit to the south coast on Sunday still promises to be another anxious afternoon given another defeat would certainly not go down well with supporters. Hürzeler’s position is set to be reviewed at the end of the season and he is convinced they are back on the right track after a run of six games without a win. Brighton will need their fans to get behind them. “If we keep doing the performance we’ve shown in recent weeks, we are 100% convinced that we will get the results we deserve,” he said. “So it’s really about focusing on the performances, focusing on the principles, focusing on bringing good energy on the pitch, focusing on getting the crowd involved, the crowd behind us.” Ed Aarons\n\nBrighton v Nottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm\n\n8 Tudor should ditch three at the back\n\nWhat we found out on Igor Tudor’s debut as Tottenham head coach is that he really wants to play three at the back despite not possessing the personnel to do so. João Palhinha was the unfortunate victim of the Croat’s in-box thinking, based on what has worked for him previously at the various clubs who have employed and – quite quickly – sacked him. Things need to change for Spurs and, considering Tudor’s only senior outfield players in the north London derby debacle were Richarlison, Dominic Solanke and Mathys Tel, it would make more sense to reconfigure the formation to avoid having a central midfielder in defence and to incorporate some of his experienced Premier League forwards. Tudor is, in theory, only in England for a short time and he needs to show future employers that he is capable of working with what he is given and he cannot face another desperate capital derby performance. WU\n\nFulham v Tottenham, Sunday 2pm\n\nView image in fullscreen João Palhinha (left) battles with Leandro Trossard during an uncomfortable afternoon in the north London derby. Photograph: Ian Walton/AP\n\n9 Amad to make way for Sesko?\n\nFor Michael Carrick to find a fall guy for Benjamin Sesko, who is seeking a first start under him, the interim manager need look no further than Amad Diallo. The Ivorian has hardly been poor in Manchester United’s strong run in which they have acquired 16 points from Carrick’s six games but he last scored for United against Bournemouth in mid-December and was taken off after 58 minutes of Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton. Sesko replaced the 23-year-old and netted the 71st-minute winner, for a third goal in four games after coming off the bench. So do not be surprised if Sesko is chosen at No 9, Bryan Mbeumo shifts from there to the right wing, and Matheus Cunha continues on the left. Jamie Jackson\n\nManchester United v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm\n\n10 Chelsea need to keep their heads\n\nThomas Tuchel was still in charge the last time Chelsea managed to overcome Arsenal. Since recording a 2-0 away win in August 2021, the west London side have lost seven of their last 10 meetings in all competitions as the balance of power in the capital has swung towards Mikel Arteta’s side. Despite winning both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final – the only defeats Liam Rosenior has suffered since taking over from Enzo Maresca in January – Arsenal will be wary of opponents who held them to a draw at Stamford Bridge in November with 10 men for more than 50 minutes after the dismissal of Moisés Caicedo. Wesley Fofana’s red card cost them against Burnley last week and Chelsea will need to maintain their discipline if they are to stand a chance of winning at the Emirates. EA"

            "content": "For 67 minutes, Nottingham Forest were at risk of matching an unwanted record. At that point Fenerbahce were 2-0 up and full of belief that they could achieve the miracle their head coach, Domenico Tedesco, had been manifesting since their 3-0 first-leg defeat in Istanbul.\n\nOnly one team in the history of European club competitions have lost the first leg of a tie by a three-goal margin at home and advanced in the second. Up in the directors’ box, Evangelos Marinakis, more than an interested party on that occasion, presumably had flashbacks of Olympiakos suffering a 4-1 home defeat by Maccabi Tel Aviv in the Conference League two years ago, only to triumph 6-1 in Serbia in the second leg.\n\nKerem Akturkoglu scored twice to fuel Fenerbahce’s hopes, his second from the penalty spot almost immediately after the half-time restart, but the Forest substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi struck midway through the second half to extinguish the visitors’ dreams. Forest will learn on Friday whether they will face Midtjylland or Real Betis, both of whom they played in the league phase and could not beat, in the last 16. Fenerbahce’s hopes of reaching the Europa League showpiece in May, across town in Besiktas Stadium, are over.\n\nThe way this game was set up, an early Fenerbahce goal was always going to shift the dynamic of the tie and the Turkish side got one when Akturkoglu applied the finishing touch to a counterattack. Vítor Pereira acknowledged the worst mistake Forest could make was to assume their place in the last 16 was secure and his much-changed side were disjointed and sloppy. “It was a thriller – with suspense,” Pereira said. “We had to suffer.”\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate. Agencies Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nIt was a long first half from a Forest perspective. The flares thrown on to the pitch by the Fenerbahce supporters within 30 seconds of kick-off paused the game for a couple of minutes. Murillo, who opened the scoring in style in Turkey, was uncomfortable and erratic after being shunted across to left-back, with fellow Brazilians Morato and Jair Cunha doing little to inspire confidence at centre-back. Luckily, Stefan Ortega, one of five Forest players to keep their spots, was alert in goal.\n\nView image in fullscreen Elliot Anderson shoots narrowly wide against Fenerbahce in the first half. Photograph: Jacob King/PA\n\nForest were in an awkward spot from the moment Dorgeles Nene released Sidiki Cherif down the right channel in the 22nd minute and suddenly it was two v two. Cherif squared the ball for Akturkoglu and, while Neco Williams got a touch after sliding in desperation, the Forest full-back then lost his footing and now the Fenerbahce forward just had Ortega to beat. Pereira scratched his head as the away end went ballistic.\n\nPereira attempted to stem the bleeding with a quadruple half-time substitution, introducing Hudson-Odoi, Ola Aina, Igor Jesus and Ibrahim Sangaré. Yet just 25 seconds after the restart, the Italian referee, Maurizio Mariani, pointed to the penalty spot after Akturkoglu collapsed in the box. Jair Cunha appeared to make little contact with the Fenerbahce striker but was deemed to have tripped Akturkoglu, who made the most of a clumsy challenge and stepped up from 12 yards to beat Ortega.\n\nThe changes lifted Forest but Pereira was always going to rest players with Sunday’s trip to Brighton their fourth game in 11 days. “We need to go there with fuel,” said the Forest head coach. “When you change half of the team it is not easy to keep the level. I didn’t expect a fantastic game after changing so many players. After we conceded the first goal, we lost the confidence to play. It was difficult for me to do four subs at the same time but we needed to do it because the game came into a dangerous situation for us.”\n\nView image in fullscreen Fenerbahce fans threw flares on to the pitch and delayed the first half. Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPA\n\nAfter the penalty, Fenerbahce raced the ball back to the centre circle. Game on? Forest were faced with exactly the kind of scenario they must have dreaded, though the fear seemed to galvanise them. Jair Cunha and Nicolás Domínguez both fired shots at goal and Williams sent a swerving effort wide.\n\nForest commanded greater control and Pereira cut a relieved figure as his side re-established a two-goal aggregate buffer, a pair of substitutes combining to devastating effect. Aina chipped the ball towards the back post where Hudson-Odoi controlled brilliantly, twisted past Nelson Semedo, a half-time arrival himself, and prodded his shot into the far corner.\n\nPereira punched the air with both fists and the underlying tensions evaporated. Forest, for so long fraught with nerves, could finally rejoice. “We lost the chance to qualify at home in Kadikoy,” Tedesco said. “They most probably over-performed in our stadium and we underperformed. We leave the competition with our heads held high.”"

            "content": "Martin O’Neill delivered a little piece of history in what will surely be his final European fixture as a manager. He created such wonderful memories for Celtic’s support in this domain during his first tenure that departing with a smile felt appropriate. In Stuttgart, Celtic won their first competitive game in Germany. It took them 17 attempts. “The evening is nothing to do with me,” said O’Neill with needless self-deprecation.\n\nLuke McCowan’s goal inside 30 seconds was irrelevant in the broader context of this tie. Stuttgart’s 4-1 canter in Glasgow a week earlier ensured that. Still, a game that had the whiff of irrelevance for Celtic delivered unexpected cheer. The statistics will show Stuttgart spent much of the evening camped in Celtic’s half – the hosts had 24 attempts at goal – but the Scottish champions played with a diligence and discipline that is worthy of huge credit. Sebastian Tounekti should even have delivered a second Celtic goal in the closing minutes. By then, Stuttgart were going through the motions.\n\nThere had appeared little to excite either set of players. Not only were Stuttgart essentially sure of progression but their current position of fourth in the Bundesliga invited a sense of bigger fish to fry. Celtic head to Ibrox on Sunday at the start of a spell that will define their domestic season. O’Neill unsurprisingly changed eight players from the weekend loss to Hibernian.\n\nDuring the first half there was cause to ponder how on earth Stuttgart had managed to score four in Glasgow. The hosts were ragged and wasteful, a matter due in part to changes in attack but hardly a scenario that will spread fear through the other teams left in this competition. Viljami Sinisalo, preferred to Kasper Schmeichel in the Celtic goal, was not forced into significant action.\n\nThe only goal involved swift, effective Celtic play. Callum McGregor fed Yang Hyun-jun, who found Junior Adamu. McCowan strode forward to meet Adamu’s pinpoint cross with his left foot, with Alexander Nübel given no chance. “I got carried away with myself,” O’Neill said later. “I thought ‘we are going to do this here’.”\n\nIf that goal was unlikely to rattle Stuttgart, Daizen Maeda should have altered the atmosphere. Instead, the Japanese forward fluffed his lines from Adamu’s cross. Stuttgart’s reply involved a complete loss of focus or imagination when within 30 yards of goal. Against a makeshift Celtic defence, this constituted strange stuff.\n\nQuick Guide European football: Celta Vigo to face Villa or Lyon, Lille bounce back Show Williot Swedberg scored the only goal as Celta Vigo beat PAOK 3-1 on aggregate in their Europa League playoff second leg to set up a last-16 tie against either Aston Villa or Lyon. Lille bounced back from losing the first leg to win 2-0 at Red Star Belgrade thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud and, in extra time, Nathan Ngoy, and will provide the other potential opposition for Villa or Lyon in Friday's draw. Robbie Keane's Ferencvaros side also overturned a one-goal first-leg deficit to win 2-0 at home and knock out Ludogorets Razgrad. First-half goals from Gabi Kanichowsky and Kristoffer Zachariassen put the Hungarian side into the next round, where they will face Porto or Braga, one of which Stuttgart will also face despite losing 1-0 at home to Celtic. Luke McCowan's goal after 28 seconds was the Europa League's fastest in 10 years but the hosts prevailed 4-2 on aggregate. Panathinaikos, who played the second half of extra time with 10 men after Javi Hernández was sent off, beat Viktoria Plzen 4-3 on penalties after a 1-1 draw in the second leg made it 3-3 on aggregate. Andreas Tetteh put the visitors ahead early but Karel Spacil equalised for Plzen and in the shootout Milos Pantovic scored the decisive spot-kick with Midtjylland or Real Betis awaiting in the last 16. Nottingham Forest, who beat Fenerbahce on aggregate, are also potential opponents for Midtjylland or Betis. Bologna beat 10-man Brann 1-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate to set up last-16 tie with either Roma or Freiburg, who could also face Genk. The Belgians survived a fightback from Dinamo Zagreb who, having scored three times to make it 3-1 on the night and 4-4 on aggregate then had Luka Stojkovic sent off in extra time either side of the home side scoring twice. In the Conference League, Fiorentina needed extra time to prevail after throwing away a 3-0 lead from the first leg at Poland's Jagiellonia Bialystok. Bartosz Mazurek had led the comeback with a hat-trick, but substitutes Nicolò Fagioli and an own goal in extra time proved enough for the Italian team despite Jagiellonia winning 4-2 on the night – Fiorentina won 5-4 on aggregate.

The switch almost paid instant dividends as Führich raced past Colby Donovan. From the resultant cross, Badredine Bouanani panicked instead of levelling the score. The next act of profligacy belonged to Tiago Tomás, who slashed a half volley wide.\n\nView image in fullscreen Martin O’Neill watching what is likely to be his final game in Europe as a manager. Photograph: Ronald Wittek/EPA\n\nThere was brief concern for O’Neill when McGregor, his captain, fell in a heap after feeling the full force of Tomás’s boot on his thigh. The midfielder was fine to play on after a brief stoppage, easing any fears he could miss the Old Firm clash. O’Neill would have been left to rue his selection of McGregor here had the incident been as serious as first appeared. It would also have left McGregor to curse this venue; he was part of the Scotland team who meekly exited Euro 2024 in Stuttgart.\n\nSinisalo saved smartly, low and to his left, from Bouanani. Celtic were only 25 minutes from that maiden win on German soil. Führich, who had beefed up the Stuttgart attack, had the ball in the Celtic net only for the strike to be correctly cancelled for offside. The officials denied Stuttgart again – and again rightly – as the substitute Ermedin Demirovic screamed for a penalty when challenged by Auston Trusty.\n\nMoments of wonderful chaos followed. Stuttgart believed Deniz Undav had equalised with an 18-yard shot which Sinisalo should probably have done better with. Celtic were furious as Demirovic had returned from treatment to immediately play a key role in the attack. The goal was disallowed, apparently for Demirovic’s illegal involvement albeit the officials had ushered him back on to the pitch. To add to the hilarity, television footage apparently meant to prove Demirovic was offside showed the 27-year-old was on. Had this incident materially mattered, it would have provoked quite the debate.\n\nBy now, 3,000 Celtic supporters were in party mode. Will this prove a high point of their season’s denouement or a springboard for greater things? Time, fascinating time, shall tell."

            "content": "Former Liverpool defender Djimi Traore waxed lyrical about Monaco star Magnes Akliouche on talkSPORT Breakfast on Thursday morning.\n\nAkliouche has been a revelation for the French giants this season, and marked his 24th birthday with a goal in Wednesday's Champions League playoff second leg stalemate with PSG.\n\n2 Akliouche is one of the most promising creative players in France Credit: AFP\n\nWhile Sebastien Pocognoli's side crashed out of the competition 5-4 on aggregate, a result that saw the defending champions progress to the round-of-16, the France international has caught the attention of a number of heavy hitters following his assist last week and goal in midweek.\n\nTottenham were credited with an interest in Akliouche over the summer, and again in the January transfer window, but opted against making a move for the creative star.\n\nAnd Traore, who is now the manager of Les Monegasques' academy side, has revealed that he is fielding calls from heavy hitters that enquire about the club's academy product.\n\nThe main Mon\n\n\"He's a fantastic player, you know,\" Traore said on talkSPORT Breakfast with Alan Brazil and Gabby Agbonlahor.\n\n\"Some people call me about him, you know, even last year, you know, from the top club. And I always recommend the club to pick him because he's a top talent. He's only like 24.\n\n\"And he's not hit the ceiling yet. So he's very good on the ball, very technical. He can create chances, he can score goals. He has good pace.\n\n\"Now, what we need from him, because he's a young player, is to be more consistent. But if you play on the team, you know, that keep the ball more and stay more in position, you can see like all his best attributes.\"\n\nAkliouche isn't the only promising star to recently come through the Monaco ranks to make the first team.\n\nEliesse Ben Seghir, Chrislain Matsima and Soungoutou Magassa all featured for the senior side before respective moves to Bayer Leverkusen, Augsburg and West Ham.\n\nMonaco's famed academy\n\nThe academy also produced the likes of Thierry Henry, David Trezeguet and current Real Madrid star Kylian Mbappe.\n\n2 Mbappe is one of a number of global superstars to have come through the Monaco ranks Credit: Getty\n\nTraore went on to discuss the club's youth system with Brazil and Agbonlahor, adding: \"Yes, we have a very, very good pathway, you know, just like the way we recruit players, you know, and the way we develop players.\n\n\"That's one of the reasons why I'm in Monaco. My second year there, I can tell you I coached some very, very talented players.\n\n\"But now the hard part for them is to be patient, because most of them, they want to go and play in the third team very, very early.\n\nAnd they don't understand like it's a step by step.\n\n\"So that's what's the hard part for me as a coach with the B team, is to keep the guys motivated and keep the guy working every single day to go through in the first team.\n\n\"Because at the end of the day, when you go through in the first team, you've been there before, you want to play straight away. Sometimes you need patience.\n\n\"And that's why like the young generation, some of them are not very patient. And some of them, you know, it makes the wrong choice.\"\n\nMonaco were unfortunate across both Champions League legs against PSG having been reduced to 10 men at a key point at the Stade Louis II and the Parc des Princes, losing Aleksandr Golovin and Mamadou Coulibaly, respectively.\n\nThey'll hope to quickly bounce back from their European disappointment and extend their Ligue 1 unbeaten run to six games with a third successive victory when they take on Angers this weekend."

            "content": "SERVED dismal meal trays in his cell and carted to tearful visitations with his parents on a golf buggy for protection, Ian Huntley’s life behind bars has long been a exercise in survival.\n\nNow, as the monstrous murderer lies in a hospital bed fighting for his life following a vicious attack yesterday, one of his former guards has lifted the lid on the extraordinary measures prisons have been forced to take over the years to fend off bloodthirsty lags desperate for a ‘trophy kill’.\n\n\n\n\n\nJournalist David McGee, who found himself guarding Huntley in a Category A jail during a daring undercover operation, said every possible precaution was taken to keep him safe from other inmates who wanted him dead.\n\nBut with prison overcrowding and staff shortages reaching a critical crisis, standards have slipped, leading to a huge surge in violence.\n\nAs part of a shocking investigation into the lax security of Britain’s jails in 2003, McGee landed a guard job and within days was placed on a rota of officers monitoring Huntley as he languished in a cell awaiting his trial at the Old Bailey for the brutal murders of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.\n\nEx school caretaker Huntley, then known behind bars as Prisoner JG5778 at Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes, was on suicide watch and needed to be closely monitored by guards around the clock.\n\nDavid recalled: “The police and prison management quite rightly feared Huntley would be killed from the very start of his stint in prison.\n\n“From day one they were terrified he would be subject to some sort of trophy attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n“They had good reason to think that – he was the most hated man in Britain at the time.\n\n“And he was surrounded by some of the country’s most depraved and dangerous criminals who knew they were never getting out of prison anyway.\n\n“Attacking Huntley would have been seen as a badge of honour.\n\n“Whoever pulled it off would have been rewarded not just with treats like tobacco from the other inmates, but more importantly, the prestige.”\n\nGuarding Huntley at Woodhill was a popular duty as warders would earn overtime, called Extra Gratuity Payments.\n\nBut it was gruelling work as the killer was locked in solitary confinement in his own individual cell block, far from any other lags.\n\nDavid explained: “None of the other inmates could get anywhere near Huntley at that time, we had to make sure everyone else was kept well away.\n\n“He was considered the very highest level of risk, the most vulnerable of all the prisoners.\n\n“Huntley was given a level of protection that was not even afforded to police officers or paedophiles, who are generally considered extremely vulnerable because they tend to be the people who are most despised by other prisoners.”\n\n\n\nPart of McGee’s job was escorting Huntley to and from his cell in a special golf buggy, because he would have been exposed for too long if he had walked.\n\nHe was given his own individual room for meetings – even though he did not get many visitors, apart from his parents and lawyers.\n\n“Huntley was certainly never allowed near the canteen – all his meals had to be delivered to him on a tray,” David added.\n\n“He was not allowed to mix and mingle at all.”\n\nSpeaking to The Sun’s Meeting The Monster series, David said the cocky killer’s mask slipped during one emotional visitation from his parents.\n\nHe explained: “I was in the room while he spoke with his parents, and although I was not close enough to hear what they were saying, it was clear his parents were very upset too.\n\n“By the time they left they were absolutely wrecked. I put my hand on Huntley’s shoulder to steer him back to the buggy.\n\n“It was only a distance of about 100 yards back to his cell but I was told he had to be driven both ways.\n\n\n\n“He was bawling his eyes out, the meeting had clearly been deeply traumatising for him.\n\n“Afterwards it took him quite a while to settle down. It was an astonishing day.”\n\nWith jails now operating at more than 99 per cent capacity, standards in prisons across the country have inevitably plummeted.\n\nMcGee tells us: “I’m not remotely surprised by this latest attack.\n\n“Complacency has set in and I know that staff have had no choice but to become more relaxed.\n\n“Huntley is one of the country’s most famous prisoners, it would still be considered a badge of honour to attack him – or worse.\n\n“Anyone who managed it would be hailed a hero by the other inmates.”\n\nI found him quite slimy and I’m sure he believed he would get away with his vile crimes\n\nOn Thursday it emerged that Huntley had been rushed to hospital after being found in a pool of blood following an attack allegedly by triple killer Anthony Russell, 43, at HMP Frankland in County Durham where he is serving a life sentence with a minimum of 40 years.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, a prisoner who slashed Huntley’s throat with a makeshift knife was jailed for life.\n\nDamien Fowkes was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years for the attempted murder of Huntley after inflicting a wound seven inches long on the Soham murderer’s neck. The court was told it was only “good fortune” that the weapon missed anything vital.\n\nHuntley had been convicted along with his girlfriend Maxine Carr, who knowingly provided him with an alibi during the search in August 2002.\n\nEfforts to locate the missing girls in the 13 days after they disappeared have been described as the most extensive in British history as 400 cops were assigned full time to the case.\n\nHuntley was arrested when cops discovered charred pieces of the red Manchester United football shirts both girls had been wearing when they disappeared."

            "content": "A MONSTER has been jailed for beating his girlfriend to death after starving her to just seven stone in a horrific abuse campaign.\n\nStephanie Blundell, 46, compared Tony Devenport’s rages to The Shining following a doomed holiday to Slovakia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former company executive was discovered lifeless on a blood-soaked mattress by her dad Phil Blundell just 11 days after returning to the UK.\n\nDevenport, 57, had been found wandering around the flat in ”an intoxicated daze”, saying : “I think she’s dead, I think she’s dead.”\n\nStephanie had more than 100 injuries and weighed just 48kg after Devenport kept her confined to their home in Chester for ten days.\n\n\n\nDevenport has now been jailed for life with a minimum of 22 years after he was found guilty of murder following a trial at Chester Crown Court.\n\nJurors heard Stephanie was ”talented young woman” who had worked as a jet-setting marketing executive for luxury watch brand Tag Heuer.\n\nBut after she met Devenport in 2024, her life began to implode and the pair began to drink heavily.\n\nProsecutor Owen Edwards KC said: “When sober he was described in messages from Stephanie as a kind man.\n\n\n\n“But when in the middle of a binge his behaviour scared Stephanie. The defendant was described as possessive angry and paranoid, and she wanted him to receive help.”\n\nDevenport went to Priory clinic and eventually quit drinking but in May 2025 fell off the wagon during the couple’s trip to Slovakia.\n\nAfter returning to the UK, Stephanie chillingly told a taxi driver: “He’ll batter me when we go in – if I go in there now, he’ll just punch me.”\n\nThe driver phoned police who arrested Devenport for assault but Stephanie asked that no action be taken against him.\n\nShe told officers: “He’s like full on serious like gunna murder me….but I mither him and I shouldn’t do that I am so sorry.”\n\n\n\nIn the days before her death, the couple booked into the Pied Bull Hotel in Chester for two nights in a bid to save their relationship but staff were called to a bust up and Devenport was thrown out in the early hours.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, Stephanie’s dad Phil went to the home after becoming concerned he had not seen her in ten days.\n\nRecalling the horror, he told police: ”I hammered on the door and Tony came to the door quite quickly.\n\n“He was in a right state, physically and mentally and he said, ‘I think she’s dead, I think she’s dead’.\n\n“I said, ‘What do you mean, you think she’s dead?’ but he was weeping and emotional and just psychotic.\n\n\n\n“He said, ‘She’s in there” and I go into the back bedroom, and it’s, it’s just a terrible, terrible sight. I knew straight away she was dead.\n\n“She had been a beautiful girl but when I saw her, she looked like a zombie. Tony was behind me and I said to him, ‘I know she’s dead, you’ve killed her’.\n\n”The apartment was covered in filth, beer cans everywhere. It was absolutely disgusting. I regret not breaking that door down earlier.”\n\nJurors heard Stephanie had 102 injuries to her body including to her brain, which contributed directly to her death and was consistent with blunt force trauma.\n\nShe had just been fed the vodka lollies and sugary treats, which left her emaciated at 48kg and in pain from alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\nDevenport claimed he “just slapped her about a few times the night before” and blamed her injuries on pushing her on a mattress.\n\nDomestic abuse - how to get help DOMESTIC abuse can affect anyone - including men - and does not always involve physical violence. Here are some signs that you could be in an abusive relationship: Emotional abuse – Including being belittled, blamed for the abuse – gaslighting – being isolated from family and friends, having no control over your finances, what you where and who you speak to\n\n– Including being belittled, blamed for the abuse – gaslighting – being isolated from family and friends, having no control over your finances, what you where and who you speak to Threats and intimidation – Some partners might threaten to kill or hurt you, destroy your belongings, stalk or harass you\n\n– Some partners might threaten to kill or hurt you, destroy your belongings, stalk or harass you Physical abuse – This can range from slapping or hitting to being shoved over, choked or bitten.\n\n– This can range from slapping or hitting to being shoved over, choked or bitten. Sexual abuse – Being touched in a way you do not want to be touched, hurt during sex, pressured into sex or forced to have sex when you do not consent. If any of the above apply to you or a friend, you can call these numbers: The Freephone National Domestic Abuse Helpline, run by Refuge on 0808 2000 247 for free at any time, day or night\n\n0808 2000 247 Men who are being abused can call Respect Men’s Advice Line on 0808 8010 327 or ManKind on 0182 3334 244\n\n0182 3334 244 Those who identify as LGBT+ can ring Galop on 0800 999 5428\n\n0800 999 5428 If you are in immediate danger or fear for your life, always ring 999 Remember, you are not alone. 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men will experience domestic abuse over the course of their lifetime. Every 30 seconds the police receive a call for help relating to domestic abuse.\n\nAndrew Madden, of the CPS, said it was “an extremely sad case and a tragic end for a young, talented woman who had a successful life ahead of her”.\n\nHe said: “At trial, Tony Devenport admitted he slapped Stephanie Blundell two or three times excessively but could provide no explanation for the 102 injuries found on her.\n\n“These included traumatic, recently inflicted brain injuries, fractures to both thyroid horns, often associated with strangulation or mechanical asphyxiation, and severe facial bruising.”\n\nHe said he repeatedly maintained Stephanie died “peacefully” due to her struggles with alcohol.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“The prosecution adduced photographs of her injuries to demonstrate to the jury his account was entirely fictitious,” he continued.\n\n“Despite Stephanie’s condition, he did nothing to obtain help and pretended that moments before her father arrived, he was attempting to resuscitate her, even though she was clearly dead.”"

            "content": "A DAD-of-three was moments from death when a huge landslide smashed through his home – thought to be caused by a Grand Designs-style development next door.\n\nAccountant Tom Baker had just left his house on the banks of the River Wye in Herefordshire when hundreds of tonnes of earth struck the property.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis wife Suzanne, who was away with their three kids, aged 14, four and 18 months, at the time, said: “If we’d been in, as would have been normal any other Friday evening, we could have been killed.\n\n“It smashed down the entire wall at one end of the house, which is where our living room is and that’s where we’d normally all be hanging out in the evenings.\n\n“Luckily I was away with the children for a couple of nights on holiday and my husband had nipped out briefly.\n\n”It is thought demolition work on a neighbouring property to create a new riverside superhome had undermined a 100ft-high bank behind the houses.\n\nMrs Baker believes it had weakened the strength of the towering bank above, triggering the landslide.\n\nShe said: “The developer and his team pulled up a number of trees both in the bank and at its footings, so a lot of its strength and stability would have been weakened as a result of that.\n\n“I believe the demolition work they carried out must have made the whole structure unsafe and now we have paid the price for that.”\n\n\n\nThe gaping hole left by the landslide has left the living room and an upstairs office bedroom of their six-bedroom in Hoarwithy completely exposed.\n\nWorkmen have spent several days trying to shore up the property and protect the exposed end of the house from rain.\n\nThe devastated family have had to remove valuables and furniture from the building and seek temporary accommodation elsewhere.\n\nMrs Baker said: “It is very fortunate that none of us were at home when this happened, but it is heartbreaking to see our beautiful home where we’ve lived for 15 years reduced to this.\n\n“It is going to take a long long time to fix it and even then we cannot be sure how stable the bank behind us is going to be. What if it collapses again?\n\n\n\n“We’re now having to live in makeshift accommodation while we speak to our insurance company and work out where we go from here.\n\n“This is all new for us and we have no idea what the future holds now. It’s incredibly stressful.”\n\nThe remains of the neighbouring detached house, which has not been occupied for more than two years, was bought by a private owner who was in the process of completing its demolition when the landslide happened.\n\nThe owner’s application to replace it with a modern four bedroom wooden home on stilts had been refused by Herefordshire Council.\n\nLast night the architect behind this new development told The Sun that they did not know the reason for the landslide but said it was indicative of climate change across the UK.\n\n\n\nHe added: “No one can know why it happened.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\n“Climate change has dropped a vast amount of water on the UK and around the world.\n\n“There had been a landslide at that site before that had damaged the house which was vulnerable and needed replacing.”"

            "content": "A MUM-of-three who disappeared without a trace in 2001 has been arrested just days after she was found alive and living a secret new life.\n\nMichelle Hundley Smith, now 62, was taken into custody in North Carolina on an outstanding warrant dating back to the year she vanished.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decades-old warrant stems from a drunk driving charge filed on November 11, 2001 – just weeks before she disappeared.\n\nAuthorities say she failed to appear in court in December 2001, and the warrant remained active for nearly 25 years.\n\nShe was arrested on Wednesday, posted a $2,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court there on March 26.\n\nSmith’s arrest comes days after detectives tracked her down last Thursday at rural North Carolina community following a tip.\n\n\n\nDeputies said she was found “alive and well” and at her request, her exact whereabouts were not released.\n\nNeighbors said she had “been here for years and years” and mostly kept to herself.\n\nAuthorities say she left her husband and three children just before Christmas in 2001 and never contacted them again.\n\nSmith was 38 when she left her home in Eden, NC, on December 9, 2001.\n\n\n\nShe had told her family she was heading to a Kmart in Martinsville, Virginia, for Christmas shopping, but never returned.\n\nHer forest green 1995 Pontiac Trans Sport van was never recovered.\n\nFor nearly a quarter century, her disappearance haunted her family and baffled investigators.\n\nAuthorities said Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page told investigators Smith left of her own accord, citing “domestic issues.”\n\nBut Sheriff Page later told Fox News the sheriff’s office had no prior domestic violence reports on file.\n\n\n\nDistrict Attorney Katy Gregg, who serves Caswell and Rockingham counties, said her office will not pursue charges related to Smith’s disappearance.\n\n“I support their decision,” Gregg said after meeting with investigators.\n\nIn interviews after resurfacing, Smith claimed she had no idea her family had spent decades searching for her.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail: “I know that I made the news, but I honestly 100% never knew that I was loved or wanted.\n\n“When I left, the mental state I was in, I thought it was my only choice.\n\n\n\n“I was just not in the mental state to stay. My children were not abandoned, they were left with their father to care for them.”\n\nSmith added that she has reconnected with her middle daughter, Amanda.\n\n“She has forgiven me and she has said I’m human like anybody else is,” Smith said.\n\n\n\nThe mum said learning of the years-long search left her devastated.\n\n“I honestly believed I didn’t matter,” she said.\n\n“When I found out, it broke me. That’s why I’m trying to rebuild something with her, because what she did, shows how much I really was loved.”\n\nShe insisted she never saw missing person flyers, billboards or news reports, adding: “If I’d had any idea, I would have already called them and let them know I was ok.\n\n“I didn’t have to go back if I didn’t want to. I could have just let my kids know I was ok.\n\n\n\n“I would have never put them through that, I thought leaving them was better for them.”\n\nNew details have also emerged about the troubled months before she vanished.\n\nSmith had reportedly struggled with alcohol abuse and had been fired from a veterinary practice for “drinking on the job,” according to her daughter Amanda in a 2018 interview on The Vanished Podcast.\n\n“My dad didn’t like the fact that my mom hid her drinking,” Amanda said.\n\n“I knew about it, and I was the only one and I felt, you know, I was young and I felt obligated not to say anything to betray my mom.”\n\n\n\nCourt records show Smith had been arrested for driving under the influence just one month before she vanished.\n\nAuthorities say her failure to appear in court triggered the warrant that remained active for decades.\n\nSheriff Page has said it was not unusual for Smith to leave home for periods of time, which reportedly explains why she was not officially reported missing until New Year’s Eve 2001 – more than three weeks after she disappeared.\n\nIn a separate 2024 post before her mother was located, Amanda wrote: “All I do know is that you left a hole in people’s hearts!”\n\nSmith’s sister, brothers and extended family have also expressed relief she is alive.\n\n\n\nHer brothers told the Daily Mail: “We want Michele to know that we are so glad she is alive, we love her, we are not mad at her, all is forgiven.”\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nSmith’s mother died in November after spending nearly 25 years searching for answers.\n\nThe district attorney’s office has said it is conducting a full review of the case."

But just 10 minutes later, the man was captured on CCTV running down the corridor completely nude.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe alerted a receptionist and said two women attacked him and stole 10,000 baht (£238.66) as well as an iPhone 15 Pro Max from his room. Police later traced one of the suspects named as Atikhun Mueangmungkhun. The 20-year-old was found in a room share, alongside four other women.

She was charged with 'robbery at night with a weapon, or by two or more persons acting together to facilitate the theft or escape with the property'.\n\nPolice Captain Assada Jarusombat of Tourist Police Division 1 said: \"We presented evidence from security cameras and the phone taken from the Chinese tourist, which served as incriminating evidence that led to the issuance of the arrest warrant.The suspect surrendered due to the evidence against her, and was handed over to the inquiry officer along with the seized items for further legal proceedings.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 4 Images Police arrested her following the incident (Image: Asia Pacific Press via ViralPress)\n\nThe arrest comes amid a spate of violent attacks on tourists in the resort town known as Sin City. On February 24, a cross dresser named Fuengfah allegedly stole 20,000 baht before attacking Korean holidaymaker Kim Sangyul, 46, when she was confronted.\n\nThe sex worker was also implicated in a street attack on German tourist Markus Santl, 55, just a day earlier. On February 17, a Chinese tourist was allegedly beaten and robbed by three sex workers when he refused to pay the extra fees they demanded.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn February 11, a group of transgender women had a mass street brawl with British tourists over alleged missing money in the same city. Locals said violent incidents were common in the city, especially around the town's Beach Road, the two-and-a-half-mile strip packed every night with street sex workers waiting for customers.\n\nView 4 Images Atikhun Mueangmungkhun was arrested over the alleged robbery (Image: Asia Pacific Press via ViralPress)\n\nDespite regular crackdowns by police, sex workers flee upon seeing approaching officers, only to later regroup when patrol units leave.

However, the region is now often seen as tarnishing the wider image of Thailand as a family-friendly holiday destination with stunning beaches, food and a rich history."

In light of its standing in the polls, Labour is keen that it doesn’t become yet another stick for opponents to beat it with.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nUnlike a Budget, the spring statement is supposed to be a much more muted affair, And Tuesday’s occasion could be very much that, with signs in advance it will be a “low key” moment.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

But expect Chancellor Rachel Reeves to use the statement to highlight Labour’s many achievements in government so far, and to impress upon voters - and financial markets - that stability is the watch word, and there are plenty of reasons for optimism.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned there could be “indications of potential risks looming on the horizon – risks which, if crystallised, could raise the spectre of another tough Autumn Budget.”\n\nWhen is the spring statement, and how long will it last?\n\nIt will be delivered on Tuesday March 3. While the timing hasn’t been confirmed, it is likely to be shortly after midday. Whereas a Budget can last for an hour, reports suggest Ms Reeves could be done and dusted in 20 minutes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWill the spring statement mean tax rises, or any changes?\n\nMs Reeves has made clear she only wants to make major fiscal announcements on tax and spending once a year, at the autumn Budget. That doesn’t mean there won’t be tweaks or updates that will impact very many people. For example, at last year’s spring statement on March 26 Ms Reeves confirmed details of changes to benefits, although some were reversed later in the year. The Chancellor will be conscious not to announce anything that could be seen as a ‘stealth’ tax on working people.\n\nWhat about changes to things like alcohol and cigarette taxes?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWe’re not expecting any new changes, beyond those confirmed in the last Budget.\n\nView 3 Images Falling inflation could deliver a borrower boosting Bank of England rare cut as soon as March (Image: PA Archive)\n\nWhat might the focus be on?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMuch attention will be updated forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility.\n\nThe OBR’s role was thrown into the spotlight at the last Budget when, in a major blunder, it accidently released its assessment in advance of Ms Reeves delivering her speech. Following a review, the OBR’s forecasts are expected to be published on the gov.uk website, rather than the OBR’s own. The watchdog won’t be updating where it thinks the government stands on its borrowing and debt targets.\n\nMuch attention will be what the OBR’s estimates for growth and living costs. The UK economy grew just 1.3% last year, and experts think it won’t do much better - if at all - in 2026, as it stands.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut things are looking up when it comes to living costs, or at least not as bad as they were. Inflation has eased a lot, and rose at 3% in the year to January. Expect the OBR to predict a further slowdown in the months ahead, helped by the £150 off energy costs announced by Ms Reeves in the Budget.\n\nOther updates to look out for are the jobless total, which has been rising slowly and hit a near five year high of 5.2% in the three months to December. There could also be revisions to the OBR’s forecasts for net UK migration. The IFS said, however: “We do not expect a major revision.”\n\nWhat it mean if I’m a borrower?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nCooling inflation paves the way for another interest rate cut from the Bank of England, which is tasked with getting it back to 2%.\n\nThe Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee next votes on March 19, with growing expectations it will cut its base rate from 3.75% to 3.5%. That’s good news if you’re a mortgage or other borrower on a variable rate. Forecasts of slowing inflation and lower government borrowing costs could also feed through to cheaper mortgages for those taking out fixed rate mortgages. Ben Thompson, director of home moving strategy at Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: “For homeowners currently on a fixed rate mortgage, the statement itself is unlikely to trigger immediate changes to monthly repayments. “However, the broader economic outlook it presents can influence where mortgage rates move in the months ahead.”\n\nWhat does it mean if I’m a saver?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThe flip side of lower costs for borrowers is lower returns for savers. If the direction of travel for borrowings costs is downwards, savers should expect deposit rates to also keep falling. That said, all lenders have different priorities so will hunt around for the best rates on offer. The difference between leaving your nest-egg in a paltry paying easy access account or a best buy savings account could be stark.\n\nWhat might Ms Reeves announce?\n\nSome experts have suggested she might look at targeted help in some areas.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nGrant Slade, economist at Morningstar, said: “One issue that the Chancellor may choose to focus on is youth unemployment. If the government’s implied fiscal headroom improves, the government could increase funding of initiatives such as its “Youth Guarantee” scheme – a £820 million existing funding package aiming to create 350,000 new training and work experience opportunities for young people.”"

He was convicted of four counts of raping a girl aged under 16, six counts of gross indecency with a girl aged under 14, and eight counts of indecent assault of a girl aged under 16 following an eight-day trial.\n\nThe judge said that Withnell had been left with \"little choice\" but to admit to making indecent photos of a child after police uncovered 132 photos of his victim. Hywel Davies, representing Withnell, said his client had no previous convictions and suffered with poor health.\n\nSentencing Withnell to 21 years in prison, Judge Eugene Egan told him: \"You caused unspeakable hardship, misery and upset and decades of emotional pain.\" Two thirds of which was to be served in custody.\n\nCoroner Andrew Morse said the date of inquest would be fixed pending investigations."

            "content": "People across the UK are being reminded of a weekend 'rule' ahead of spring, as many homeowners are set to start house improvements and DIY garden renovations. Typically, the peak time homeowners begin working on their properties is between March and May, according to Zoopla.\n\nWhen the weather gets warmer, people usually become more interested in home improvement projects, making it the most active time to start renovations. After a cold and wet winter, spring is often seen as the ideal time to breathe life back into your home and garden. However, anyone planning any major construction work in a built-up residential area should be mindful of a 'noise rule'.\n\nAcross the UK, the standard time for noisy construction work to begin is between 8am and 6pm on Mondays through to Fridays, and between 8am and 1pm on Saturdays. Noisy work outside of these times could put you at risk of getting in trouble with not only your neighbours but also your local council. Noisy work is also generally expected to be avoided completely on Sundays and Bank Holidays.\n\nAlthough there is no single nationwide rule, most areas across the UK operate under expectations set by local councils via the Control of Pollution Act 1974. Local councils have the power to impose significant penalties for violations of noise restrictions, including issuing a Noise Abatement Notice.\n\nA Noise Abatement Notice is an official document issued by a local council when it considers a noise to be a \"statutory nuisance\" under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This can include things like really loud music, parties, or barking dogs. The notice tells the person to stop or reduce the noise, usually right away.\n\nFailing to comply with a Noise Abatement Notice for loud building work could result in a hefty fine. For commercial construction projects that fail to comply with a noise restriction notice, fines may reach up to £20,000. Domestic or DIY noise complaints may result in fines of up to £5,000.\n\nCouncils often first issue a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN), which allows the offender to pay a fine rather than face prosecution. FPNs can be up to £110 for dwellings or £500 for licensed premises. However, in extreme cases of non-compliance with a notice, fines can be unlimited.\n\nThe 8am start time is a standard across much of the UK, but local councils have the freedom to set their own permitted hours and enforcement measures, meaning the rule is not legally binding in exactly the same way everywhere. For instance, Westminster City Council in London allows noisy construction from 8am to 6pm on weekdays but strictly prohibits it on Sundays and Bank Holidays.\n\nElsewhere, Birmingham City Council imposes similar times, including keeping 'noisy construction work' to 8am and 1pm on Saturdays. Spelthorne Borough Council says: \"Contractors may work outside these hours if they are not causing any noise, i.e. painting and decorating.\" A large majority of councils follow the same protocols, but it is wise to check your local authorities' rules.\n\nOn Gov.uk, it says: \"Councils can serve a notice on people carrying out construction or demolition works and tell them how the work should be carried out to avoid a potential statutory noise nuisance. The notice can specify any of the following: a noise level, the plant or machinery that can be used, the hours when work can be done and steps that need to be taken to minimise noise. Those failing to comply with the notice can be prosecuted and fined an unlimited amount, with further fines for each day that they fail to comply.\"\n\nSome councils may permit 7.30am starts for certain commercial projects or in industrial zones. It is best to check your local council's website first before planning any major DIY projects for your home or garden.\n\nIt's important to note that 'quiet' work, which doesn't involve loud tools or machinery, may be tolerated outside the standard hours. However, this is often at the discretion of your local council or neighbours.\n\nMany councils typically define 'noisy work' as any activity producing sound at a level likely to disturb nearby residents. This includes not just heavy equipment like jackhammers and angle grinders, but also hammering, drilling, sawing, heavy lifting using metal scaffolding, operating cement mixers, and even construction material deliveries that use lorries with reversing beepers or cranes.\n\nBuilders and DIYers are urged to check directly with their local authority for the precise working hours permitted. It is also key to check your council's latest guidance on applying for any necessary permissions or extensions."

But it is the shadowy nature of Epstein's dealings that has compounded a chilling sense of conspiracy and intrigue - where did his money come from, who really knew about and participated in his sex trafficking ring, and why are so many of those who accused or associated with him now dead?\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEven Epstein's own death is shrouded in mystery after a document in the files announced his passing the day before it actually happened. Many have claimed that the he did not take his own life in jail, as was officially recorded, but that he was murdered while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. But as the apparent mastermind of the hideous operation, why would anyone want to kill him?\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source. Click here to activate or add us as your Preferred Source in your Google search settings.\n\nView 9 Images Ghislaine Maxwell recently appeared before the House Oversight Comittee (Image: PA)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEpstein and co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell have long been accused of keeping a list or black book of associates to levy as blackmail - claims Maxwell denied during an interview with the US Department of Justice last July. Hidden cameras were found in Epstein's Palm Beach house - one in a carriage clock - adding to suspicions that he made his millions by blackmailing his wealthy friends.\n\nThe impact of the files has been far-reaching. In the UK, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson have both been arrested and quizzed by police on suspicion of passing on sensitive documents to Epstein while in public roles as Trade Envoy and Business Secretary respectively. An email appearing to be sent by Maxwell confirms that a picture of Andrew taken with Epstein victim Virgina Guiffre was real - something the former duke has always denied.\n\nThe list of names is seemingly endless - Donald Trump, Richard Branson, Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Sarah Ferguson and Elon Musk all feature. Even Steven Hawkins makes an appearance in a photo showing him reclining on a sun-lounger flanked by two bikini-clad women, who his family insist were his carers. Inclusion in the Epstein files is not an indication of guilt, nor of knowledge of his crimes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nBut many believe the files are merely the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the lurid workings of Epstein's operations. His victims have long claimed they were groomed while underage by Maxwell and recruited to give massages and sexual favours to Epstein and his friends. In the files, the youngest victim appears to be aged just nine.\n\nOne accuser told the FBI Andrew watched her being tortured as a schoolgirl at Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. The accuser claimed she was strapped to a table and \"tortured with electrical shocks\" by Maxwell, while a group of men watched. The former prince has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn separate claims, the alleged victim said she was between six and eight years old when she was \"drugged at night and driven by my father, [redacted], to pedophile ring 'parties'.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThere are yet darker claims about cannibalism and satanic rituals - something that does not feature explicitly in the files. And for now, Maxwell is keeping her council, citing her fifth amendment right unless she is granted clemency. She is currently serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.\n\nBut her silence could be all the more understandable given the fate of Epstein and the mysterious string of deaths.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland was reportedly hospitalised on Tuesday, February 24, just a few days after he was charged with serious corruption offences, linked to his association with the paedophile. Jagland was charged with \"gross corruption\" after newly released documents appeared to reveal a transactional relationship between the ex-PM and Epstein, between 2011 and 2018. Some Norwegian newspaper outlets have reported that he was hospitalised because of a suicide attempt, but his spokesperson denied this, citing instead stress.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHere, The Mirror takes a look at the suicides and unexpecting passings that have plagued those associated with the scandal, many of whom tried to bring Epstein to justice...\n\nEpstein death riddle\n\nView 9 Images The scene of Epstein's death (Image: 60 Minutes/CBS)\n\nJeffrey Epstein's death inside a New York prison cell in 2019 ignited explosive theories that only spread further amid the mystery behind missing CCTV footage. On July 23, he was found in his cell with injuries to his neck and in a semi-conscious state.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOfficials quizzed his cellmate Nicholas Tartagilone, though an investigation cleared him of wrongdoing. Epstein had been returned to the security housing unit in the prison, where he was supposed to have a cellmate and be checked on every 30 minutes. But his cellmate was moved on August 9; the day before he died. Both guards who were assigned to check on Epstein fell asleep while on shift and falsified their records. And cameras in the holding area were said to be malfunctioned or were broken.\n\nThe Epstein Files included a draft of a formal statement announcing his death, which was dated a day before he was actually found hanged.\n\nMaxwell herself said in an interview last August \"I do not believe he died by suicide,\" but she called the idea that he had been killed to protect rich and powerful people \"ludicrous,\" instead stating she believes that it was in her view \"an internal situation\" within the prison, saying: \"In prison, where I am, they will kill you or they will pay - somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary. That's about the going rate for a hit with a lock today\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nA pathologist present at Epstein's post-mortem - and hired by Epstein's estate - has called for reinvestigation into the financier's death. \"My opinion is that his death was most likely caused by strangulation pressure rather than hanging. Given all the information now available, further investigation into the cause and manner of death is warranted.\"\n\nVirginia Giuffre\n\nOne Epstein's most high profile accusers, Virginia Giuffre died last April in Western Australia by suicide. At age 41, she left behind three children, who had been removed from her care. She was estranged from her husband, Robert Giuffre, and an intense legal battle has been launched over the fortune she left behind, with her sons arguing that an unsigned will is not valid.\n\nView 9 Images Virginia pictured in hospital after the mysterious crash (Image: INSTAGRAM)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHer relationship with her husband had been rocky. She met and fell in love with Australian martial arts trainer Robert when she was just 19, while training at a massage school in Thailand. Epstein had instructed her to bring a Thai girl back to the US with her, but instead, Virginia married Robert just 10 days after their first meeting, and made a new life for herself in Australia.\n\nIn 2015 when the family lived in Colorado, US, the police attended a domestic violence incident at their home concerning allegations that Robert had assaulted Virginia. In early 2025, after another incident, Robert was granted a restraining order against Virginia which prohibited her from seeing her children. No charges were filed.\n\nAfter years of seeking justice for survivors, Virgina's powerful autobiography, Nobody's Girl, was slated for an October 2025 release date. Sadly, it was an occasion she never got to see.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nJust six months before, Virginia shared photographs lying bruised and bloodied in a hospital bed following an apparent collision with a school bus near Perth, Western Australia. She told how she had suffered kidney failure and been given just four days to live.\n\nHowever, the Western Australia Police Force (WAPF) described it as \"a minor crash\" between a bus and a car north of Perth, clarifying that there had been no reports of any serious injuries. Meanwhile, John WA ambulance services have also reported that there are no records of any emergency response resulting in hospitalisation.\n\nVirgina made a recovery but was found dead on her farm just a month later in an apparent suicide. Her father, Sky Roberts, told Piers Morgan that 'someone got to her' and there was 'no way' she would have killed herself.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nIn December 2019, Ms Giuffre posted her own message which read: \"I am making it publicly known that in no way, shape or form am I suicidal. I have made this known to my therapist and GP – If something happens to me – in the sake of my family do not let this go away and help me to protect them. Too many evil people want to see me quieted.\"\n\nJean-Luc Brunel\n\nView 9 Images Film director Brett Ratner and Jean-Luc Brunel in a photo included in the Epstein Files (Image: Department of Justice)\n\nEpstein's pal, modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, was found hanged in Paris prison cell in 2022.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe had been detained for more than year, and was under investigation for suspicion of rape and trafficking of minors for sexual exploitation. Brunel was suspected of having been part of a global underage sex ring organised by late paedophile Epstein and had been originally indicted for the \"rape of a minor over 15 years old\". He also allegedly procured women and girls for the convicted sex offender.\n\nEpstein had funded the founding of Brunel's US agency MC2 Model Management and Brunel was a cofounder of the French agency Karin Models.\n\nHe was found hanging in his cell at 1am. An investigating source said: \"A night patrol found his lifeless body. A judicial enquiry has been launched, and early evidence points to suicide. There were no obvious fears for the prisoner's health and he was not on a suicide watch, having already been in prison for many months.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nRuslana Korshunova\n\nView 9 Images Ruslana Korshunova, pictured wearing Betsey Johnson, shot to fame in the mid-2000s before things took a tragic turn (Image: Thomas Concordia/WireImage.com)\n\nRuslana Korshunova was a rising star model who had been dubbed the Russian Rapunzel for her long, knee-length hair. Signed at just 15 in 2003, her career had seen her undertake campaigns for Marc Jacobs, Ghost, Nina Ricci, Christian Dior and Vera Wang.\n\nThree years later she travelled to Epstein's private Caribbean island, Little St. James - one of many teenagers who flew on his private jet, nicknamed the 'Lolita Express' - it has been revealed in the Epstein files.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOn June 26 2006, someone wrote to Epstein saying: \"I still have the white underwear we bought for Ruslana in St. John. Do you want me to give it to her?\" to which he replied with an address and a time.\n\nView 9 Images Ruslana's body was found in the street beneath her Manhattan apartment (Image: NY Daily News via Getty Images)\n\nRuslana died two years later in New York, after jumping from her ninth floor apartment just days before her 21st birthday. She was mentioned in correspondence between Epstein and his associates after her death, with someone writing to Epstein three years later, \"Jeffrey, it is true that the agency failed to pay Ruslana Korshunova?\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEpstein wrote to a redacted email account in 2010, \"i hope you are having fun, two years ago „ ruslana a russian mod=l. died, mainly as a result of her boyfriends' belief in alternative m=dicine. vs real medicne\" [sic].\n\nHer mum, however, insisted that she would never have taken her own life. \"She told me about her work problems about a year ago. She said that she wanted to quit the modelling career. Everything was fine with her recently though. If she had problems at work, she would have told me.\"\n\nSteve Bing\n\nView 9 Images Steve Bing pictured with his ex, Liz Hurley (Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHollywood movie producer Steve fell to his death from a Los Angeles skyscraper at the age of 55 in June 2020. The star, who fathered son Damien with ex Liz Hurley, had been an associate of Epstein's - but not one suspected of wrongdoing.\n\nAnd before his death, his late girlfriend's aunt has claimed her niece had urged him to speak out.\n\nCarrie Mitchum, aunt to Allexanne Mitchum - who died in 2019 - said in a Facebook post: \"Steve also knew Jeffry Epstein. They weren't close and Steve didn't 'hang out' with him but a little over a year ago Allexanne convinced Steve to make a statement via his attorneys telling what he did know.\n\n‌\n\n\n\n\"Allexanne was such a staunch advocate for victims of the sex trade and felt any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, could prove to be useful. That's it. No big mystery or conspiracy here.\"\n\nAllexanne died in 2019 of an accidental drug overdose, at the age of 28. Steve took his own life as the first anniversary of Allexanne's death drew near. Carrie claimed Steve and Allexanne had had a spat on June 26 2019, and she had gone to stay at a pal's house. They had made up, but before returning to their shared home she took what she believed to be a Xanax pill. It was laced with fentanyl, and caused her to overdose. She later died in hospital.\n\nSteven Hoffenberg\n\nEpstein associate Steven Hoffenberg was found dead at 77 in Connecticut in 2022. He had laid dead for a week with natural causes given as the reason. Hoffenberg was sentenced to 20 years in prison for a massive fraud scheme that saw thousands of people lose money to the tune of $460million in 1997. He alleged Epstein had designed the scheme and that they worked together closely on it. Before his death he alleged that Maxwell and Epstein \"were 'taping' honey-trap videos of sleazy VIPs with underage girls for a cabal of deep-state blackmailing power brokers.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nVirginia Giuffre repeatedly claimed that Epstein videotaped his high-powered friends using hidden cameras in an attempt to get leverage on them - something backed up by the Mirror's historic investigation into hidden spy cameras in Epstein's mansions.\n\nCarolyn Andriano\n\nCarolyn, one of Epstein and Maxwell's victims, was just 14 when she met the pair in Florida. She died of an accidental overdose in 2023 at age 36, and had acted a key witness in securing the conviction of Maxwell.\n\nShe began working for Epstein as a teenager taking on the role of a cleaner and was abused by the sex traffickers for three years, leaving her with lifelong mental health issues, including drug dependency.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAccording to ITV, her mother Dorothy said that her daughter would regularly come home with bite marks and bruises on her body - making up excuses about where they had come from.\n\nLeigh Skye Patrick\n\nAnother victim, Leigh Skye Patrick, died at 29 in a West Palm Beach hotel room in 2017 in what was ruled an accidental overdose. Kathryn Smerling, a psychologist, told Fox News about her death that the \"objectification\" that Epstein's victims went through is \"very traumatic\", and that without proper therapeutic and family support, victims of trafficking will sadly often misuse substances as a way to cope.\n\nLeigh had a twin sister called Selby Patrick, who told the Daily Mail two years after her sister's death that the root of Leigh's suffering had been Epstein, \"[She suffered tremendously and it started with Epstein\" Selby was quoted as saying, adding that her sister had \"struggled with addiction since the time she met that guy\".\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAlfredo Rodriguez\n\nEpstein's former butler, Alfredo Rodriguez, died in 2014. Rodriguez had stolen Epstein's \"Black Book\" and tried to sell it in 2009 to an undercover FBI agent for $50,000. Instead of pocketing any cash for the address book filled with big names, he was slapped with an obstruction of justice charge for not handing it over as evidence.\n\nHe was sentenced to 18 months in 2012 and died on 28 December 2014 from mesothelioma.\n\nPolice, lawyers, and more\n\nAn officer who investigated Epstein, Joe Recarey, in his original conviction for child sex crimes died in 2018, five years after he retired. He died at the age of 50 and had been the lead investigator in the case, reportedly meticulously putting together evidence on Epstein's crimes. Epstein's cellmate - the last he had before his death in 2019 - died a year later of COVID-19. Efrain 'Stone' Reyes, is reported to have spoken to the federal investigation into Epstein's death not long before he died, and had been transferred out of the cell the night before Epstein's death.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nThreatened journalists\n\nJournalist Vicky Ward has claimed that when she was profiling Epstein back in 2003 for Vanity Fair he threatened her whilst she was pregnant with twins. She told the Netflix documentary Filthy Rich, that he told her \"it's going to be bad for you and your family\" if he didn't \"like\" the piece. She also alleged that he threatened to \"have a witch doctor place a curse on [her] unborn children\".\n\nView 9 Images Former Prime Minister of Norway, Thorbjørn Jagland, was rushed to hospital (Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nShe further claimed that her editor was \"pretty spooked because he'd found a severed cat head in his garden [and] he also found a bullet on his doorstep\". However, Vanity Fair editor Grayson Carter does not agree with this version of events, saying that the legal threshold for publication was not met at the time, and that he did not \"trust\" Ward.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAnother contributing editor for Vanity Fair, John Connelly, who died in 2019, has said that Carter told him about the cat's head and the bullet. He said in 2003 Epstein was \"torturing\" Carter in an attempt to ensure there were no reports on the young women or girls. Connelly claimed that he pursued his own reporting into Epstein in 2006, but after Carter told him that he was afraid for the safety of his children, the journalist dropped the story.\n\nFor emotional support you can call the Samaritans 24-hour helpline on 116 123, email jo@samaritans.org, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website."

Next Thursday, the maps show the mercury could rise to 16C at around midday in southern and eastern regions.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHighs of 14C and 15C are possible quite widely across England around this time. However, conditions are expected to be notably cooler in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the far north of England.\n\nView 3 Images Temperatures could rise to 16C at midday on Thursday (Image: metdesk)\n\nEngland and Wales will be hotter than Zante as weather maps show heat blast date READ MORE :\n\nUK weather maps show 18C heat spike as England hotter than Greece on Wednesday READ MORE :\n\nEnsure our latest headlines always appear at the top of your Google Search by making us a Preferred Source.

Yorkshire, the Midlands and southern areas - including London - could rise to 16C.\n\nIn contrast, temperatures are only expected to rise as high as 15C in sunny Benidorm. The same is true for Ibiza.\n\nAnd temperature anomaly maps for next Thursday have turned deep red over England. This indicates that temperatures will be well above the seasonal average.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 3 Images Highs of 17C are on the cards in the evening (Image: metdesk)\n\nThe Met Office says “plenty of dry weather” and “some sunshine” is to come. Its forecast for March 3 to 12 states: “Much of this period looks like being largely dominated by high pressure, especially towards the south or southeast of the UK.\n\n“This will mean many places seeing plenty of dry weather with variable cloud amounts and some sunshine, the best of this towards the south or southeast, but perhaps with some fog overnight.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n“However, frontal systems are still likely to affect the north and west of the UK at times though, maybe also briefly affecting other parts, bringing some rain and strong winds, and perhaps a little snow to the high ground in the north. Temperatures will be near or above normal, although patchy overnight frost is still likely at times.”"

Truman: 'If you want loyalty, get a dog'.\n\n'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex,' Warren said bluntly of Benn. 'He's been protected.\n\n'Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nDaily Mail Sport reported that Hearn is thought to have lent Benn £500,000 following the collapse of his 2022 match-up with Eubank Jr, which came about due to his positive tests.\n\nHearn also repeatedly defended Benn in public during the lengthy legal battle which followed - only to learn of the end of his relationship with the boxer via email.\n\n'It is very disappointing considering everything I have done for him,' Hearn said. 'Maybe I misjudged his character.'\n\n'I just think the way it was done was very very wrong. But everyone is different. Some people, loyalty really matters, other people maybe not so.\n\n'The way it played out to receive an email from the lawyer and then to ask for a call and not the willingness to have it, you just lose a bit of your soul to it.'"

'I won't tell you exactly what was in it.'\n\nFrank Warren responds to a potential LEGAL BATTLE in boxing 🥊😧 pic.twitter.com/93ohmI9Zkk — Daily Mail Sport (@MailSport) February 25, 2026\n\nFrank Warren (right) has given his verdict on Conor Benn splitting from Eddie Hearn (left)\n\nBenn (pictured) ditched Hearn following his victory over Chris Eubank Jr in November\n\nBut he did offer a huge clue when he added: 'As former American President Harry S. Truman said, if you want loyalty, get a dog.'\n\nHis opinion of Benn was blunt in the extreme: 'Conor's not even the best welterweight in Essex. He's been protected. Never fought a contender, never fought for a world title, let alone won one. Forget the two fights with Chris Eubank because I've never rated Junior either.\n\n'So lucky Conor, with all he's been paid so far for such little talent. Even more so with the millions of dollars he's supposed to be getting from UFC boss Dana White as he tries to make it in boxing.'\n\nWarren was speaking at the London media launch for Wardley versus Dubois in Manchester on April 11. Those two were in good voice.\n\nWardley astonished the boxing world by coming out of white collar events to become a world champion. To such an extent that when the WBO belt arrived in the post two weeks ago, the inscription of his name on the silver was accompanied by Dave Allen's nickname 'The White Rhino.'\n\nThis eloquent pugilist said: 'They sent a replacement without a nickname because I don't have a nickname and don't want one. Fabio Wardley is good enough for me when I'm knocking people out.'\n\nHe made it clear, also, that he hand picked another Dynamite puncher in Dubois as his first title challenger 'because I love wars with big hitters which are exciting for the public and for me.'\n\nDubois expressed thus his hunger to become a two-time world champion: 'Losing my belt to Oleksandr Usyk was like losing a girlfriend, even though it was to the greatest fighter of his generation. Now I'm going to renew that relationship.'\n\nEach believes it will be him adding yet another mighty KO to his record. And they agree this slugfest will not go anywhere near the 12 round distance.\n\nSo does Warren. Which is why his promotional title for this fight is 'Don't Blink.'"

The cameras were forced to cut away before medics attended to the fighter.\n\nReplays show that late in the first round, the two boxers clashed heads, with George coming away dazed and shaken. It appears this was the reason for his sudden fall to the canvas.\n\nThe 36-year-old made it back to his feet following medical attention and was taken to a Detroit hospital to be monitored. Oberlton was then awarded the victory by technical knockout, extending his unbeaten record to 15 wins.\n\nFrightening scenes in Detroit.

'I'm a true champion, true warrior. We can do whatever you want to do it, but I'm just happy that he's OK.\n\n'I just wanted to make sure he was safe. At the end of the day, we're warriors, but we want to leave here the same way we come out.'\n\nLater in the night, Shields defended her undisputed heavyweight championship in dominant fashion, dispatching Crews-Dezurn by unanimous decision.\n\n\n\nThe 30-year-old American won 100-90 on all three judges' scorecards and remains unbeaten in her professional career, with a record of 18 wins."

The bear then follows Makhmudov and lifts onto its haunches before the Russian proceeds to put the animal in a headlock and then an aptly-named bear hug.\n\nThis is not the first time Makhmudov, who is based in Canada, has wrestled a bear to prepare for a fight, having done so in August before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion. He told WorldBoxingNews in September: 'It started with a friend asking me if I wanted to wrestle a bear, and I said, \"Of course.\"\n\n'It was very scary, for sure. It's an animal, so it's literally wild, but I took it as a test because I always like to be challenged.\n\nJust Arslanbek Makhmudov wrestling a bear 𝐀𝐆𝐀𝐈𝐍 as he prepares to face Tyson Fury 😱 pic.twitter.com/efzmEsJMvf — DAZN Boxing (@DAZNBoxing) February 21, 2026\n\nMakhmudov, who will face Tyson Fury at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in April, can be seen wrestling the bear as it attempted to lock its jaw down on his arm in preparation for the bout\n\nMakhmudov last wrestled a bear before his victory over David Allen to become the WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight champion\n\n'I think most of the reaction was positive. Of course, some people didn't understand why I did that. But I like I said, for me, it was like a test. Not just physically, but also mentally.'\n\nHe told the same outlet earlier this month that this will be the last time he will wrestle a bear before a fight, saying: 'I promised my mother not to do wrestling with bears. Because you have to understand this is very dangerous.\n\n'This fight, I'm starting my camp in Russian mountains and then we go back to Montreal, Canada to prepare for war.'\n\nMakhmudov posted the clip of him fighting a bear to his Instagram page on Saturday, though wrote that he is 'not responsible for it anymore' - indicating that he has followed through with his promise to his mother.\n\n'3 meter tall and 400kg weight MONSTR!,' he wrote. 'Many people think he's probably crazy since he's fighting a bear?!\n\n'Yes, it's crazy, I agree! But even madness is justified when you pursue good goals, and the goal was to overcome the threshold of fear and learn to control yourself in critical situations!\n\n'PS if someone thinks it's easy, I can send you the location, let them try it! But I'm not responsible for it anymore.'\n\nMeanwhile Fury's return signals the end of a fifth spell of retirement, the latest in which he triggered after losing a second consecutive bout to Oleksandr Uksyk in Dcember 2024.\n\nFury, 37, will come out of retirement after a year-long spell away from boxing to take on the heavy-handed Russian\n\nFury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer\n\n'The biggest turning point in this comeback for me was the tragedy that happened with Anthony Joshua,' he said earlier this month. 'I was on holiday in Thailand with my family for Christmas, just to get away from the rain.\n\n'I hear all that bad news that's gone on and I thought, you know what, life is very short, very precious and very fragile. Tomorrow is a mystery, we have to live for today.\n\n'And me living for that day, I made my mind up there and then that I'm going to come back to boxing - because it's something that I love, I'm passionate about and that I've always been in love with.'\n\n'The Gypsy King' has been trained since 2019 by American coach SugarHill Steward, who helped him reclaim the WBC world title before the pair of defeats by Usyk. Fury has also confirmed that he will go into this comeback fight without a trainer.\n\n'I don't need a trainer, I don't need a nutritionist, I don't need a mind coach, I don't need a sleep coach and I definitely don't need a strength coach,' he told BBC 5 Live.\n\n'Here's what I need in boxing - someone to wash my gumshield out and give me some water between rounds, and give me a smear of Vaseline across the eyes, and leave the rest to me.\n\n'(I've got a) PhD in boxing.'\n\n\n\nFury, who has 34 wins in 37 fights including one draw, dismissed claims his fight with the unheralded Makhmudov might struggle to sell 60,000 tickets at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with the 36-year-old saying that his inactivity in the last 16 months 'is a massive factor'."

It won't be Tottenham.\n\nArsenal could be lifting the Champions League at the end of the season after their dream draw\n\nBodo/Glimt have beaten Manchester City on their own patch and knocked out last season's finalists Inter Milan over two legs. But excitement should be through the roof in London Colney this morning.\n\nThe snap reaction to the draw made for fascinating viewing across the continent.\n\nThere was a sense of devilment in France after PSG drew Chelsea, who they lost to in the Club World Cup final over the summer, with daily sports newspaper L'Equipe running the headline: 'The time for revenge'.\n\nAcross in Spain, with three teams all drawn against English opposition, the reaction was markedly mixed.\n\nFrustration in one half of Madrid as Real Madrid, for the 10th and 11th time in five seasons, take on Manchester City in a 'scalding' draw. On the other side of the City, Atletico Madrid supporters rejoiced at getting a visit from 'Dr Tottenham'.\n\nFor Barcelona, who drew Newcastle United, it was little more than a shrug of the shoulders for what they see as the 'least tough' draw.\n\nIvan Rakitic pulls out Arsenal's name on the ideal side of the draw for Mikel Arteta's men\n\nWhat this draw did do was pave a path for the Ballon d'Or contenders and in a season where Champions League and the World Cup will hold the most weight - domestic records never seem to interest voters in these cycles - the stars are aligning for the likes of Declan Rice and Harry Kane.\n\nFor Kane, he has the difficult path, needing to go through Atalanta, then either Real Madrid or Manchester City, just to book a semi-final with potentially defending champions PSG.\n\nFor Rice, this may be his greatest ever opportunity with a Premier League title, Champions League title, and a World Cup all still in his sights.\n\nFor both to meet in the final in Budapest, with all the marbles pushed to the middle of the table as they both chase their first ever Champions League title, may have seemed a somewhat remote prospect. Not any more.

            "content": "As they climbed the metal staircase behind the Main Stand at Kenilworth Road, a Luton supporter’s spectacles slipped from the top of her head and clanged against the steel.\n\n‘Excuse me, you dropped your glasses,’ said the gentleman behind her, who stooped to collect and return them. ‘Could have done you a favour,’ he added with a grin. ‘You don’t want to watch this, clearly.’\n\nI shuffled up the steps beside them to join 3,500 Luton fans for their EFL Trophy quarter-final against Plymouth on Tuesday to get a feeling for the fan frustration that, just three days earlier, led to manager Jack Wilshere being restrained by his own players amid a furious confrontation with a supporter.\n\nOn Saturday, two years to the day since Luton led at Anfield in the Premier League, they conceded a stoppage-time equaliser to struggling Burton Albion that left the Hatters six points adrift of the League One play-offs and a toxic divide between the club and its fans reached boiling point.\n\nAs the team made their way towards the tunnel, with boos and foul language ringing in their ears, Wilshere first held back his own captain Kal Naismith before turning towards a fan at the front of the stand. Videos later plastered over social media showed Wilshere appearing to say ‘shut your f***ing mouth’ before being led away down the tunnel.\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’ while another called it ‘something you would never say in the street’. At least one member of club staff took it upon themselves to call Wilshere early the next morning to check in on him.\n\nLuton Town manager Jack Wilshere had to be restrained by his own players amid a furious confrontation with a supporter\n\nMultiple witnesses have told Daily Mail Sport that the fan directed personal abuse at Wilshere. One source described it as ‘unrepeatable, vicious and obscene’\n\nYou know things have gone wrong somewhere when a fan is throwing abuse at a young coach who started his playing career at Luton aged eight, grew up a few miles down the road, and returned to train with the club before hanging up his boots.\n\nSo, why such anger? Luton are unbeaten in 11 home league games and, if they win their game in hand on Huddersfield, would be three points off the play-offs. Their victory over Plymouth, having been reinstated into the competition after Swindon Town fielded two ineligible players against them, has them a home win against Northampton Town next week from Wembley.\n\nFor a start, supporters are struggling to embrace Wilshere’s style of play. The Arsene Wenger disciple wants his team to get it down and pass it, as his Arsenal Under 18s did to great effect, but this is a club that reached its heights on fast-paced blood and thunder under Rob Edwards.\n\nJust 97 seconds had passed against Burton when midfielder George Saville passed back to centre half Mads Andersen and the first boos sounded. And on Tuesday as Luton fumbled at the back under pressure from Plymouth’s front line, a furious cry of ‘Get it out! It’s tippy-tappy AGAIN!’ echoed from the back of the Main Stand.\n\nWilshere has talked about forging an identity, and a desire not to 'pass the ball around the back just to pass it around the back’, but six away defeats on the spin and unsuccessfully sitting on their narrow lead against Burton pushed them to tipping point.\n\n‘My message to them is point their anger towards me,’ said Wilshere after a loss to Wigan in the previous game. ‘I'm their manager, I make the decisions.’ So, they did.\n\nClub sources insist Saturday’s incident was a one-off. Wilshere has been happy to speak with fans after games about their frustrations, as he did after a draw at Leyton Orient, but on this occasion felt he had no choice but to react to personal abuse.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere. He’s the third manager in less than a year for a club that has suffered back-to-back relegations, the second of which came on the final day of last season when they shipped five to West Brom and went down on goal difference.\n\nLuton’s issues lie much deeper than Wilshere.

But Jack isn’t the root of the problem.\n\n‘We’ve gone from the Premier League to 10th in League One in 18 months and there is an awful lack of communication from those above as to why this happened.\n\n'We don’t get relegated twice without making errors, certainly not with the financial windfalls from the Premier League. The fans just feel like they’re being taken a little for granted.’\n\nChief executive Gary Sweet insisted in September after a poor start under Matt Bloomfield that reaching the play-offs was the ‘absolute minimum’ and automatic promotion still the target... yet hired a young, inexperienced coach a month later in Wilshere.\n\nThey considered Leyton Orient boss Richie Wellens, a more experienced manager, but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews.\n\nSo, while Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath. And when you’re at a club that has gone from non-League to the very top and back down again so quickly, it can be hard to readjust your expectations when faced with the reality.\n\nClub insiders talk of a much-needed culture change. One source described Luton as an ‘oil tanker’ that needs turning around. There’s been a huge overhaul of players, so much so that five of the 12 players on the club’s 2026 calendar are now out on loan, but too many of the arrivals failed to hit the ground running.\n\nLuton considered more experienced managers but plumped for Wilshere after being impressed with his ‘energy’, ‘ambition’ and ‘passion’ across four interviews\n\nWhile Wilshere’s project clearly needs time, the club is telling fans to demand instant results in another breath\n\nAnother source remarked that the squad was previously full of players who thought they were ‘too good for the Championship after a half-decent Premier League season’.\n\nLuton are set to move into a new 25,000 stadium at Power Court for the 2028-29 season yet there’s feeling among the fans that the club have prioritised that much-needed development over the football (despite having the biggest budget in League One).\n\nBehind the scenes, Wilshere has made a start on turning the tanker around. Insiders say the atmosphere at the training ground has improved greatly since his arrival, with players sticking around to play pool and darts after sessions when in recent years they couldn’t wait to get out the door.\n\nWhen staff called Wilshere the morning after his confrontation, he was already at the training ground. He slept some nights on a bed in his office. His players’ phones ping late into the night with his WhatsApp messages. Staff have asked Wilshere, half-jokingly, if he was seeing his family enough.\n\nHe's ordered striker Elijah Adebayo, out with a long-term knee injury, to report to his office once a week as Wilshere knows only too well the importance of being kept involved when you’re on the sidelines. The night after the Plymouth game, he gave a lecture at the University of Bedfordshire.\n\nAll of this means little to fans, of course, if that work ethic still leads to performances like Burton.\n\n‘Luton see the football team very much as part of the town,’ adds Harper. ‘We’re a hard-working town and all we expect on a Saturday afternoon is that our team works really hard. In the last three league games, that wasn’t the case.’\n\nWilshere’s tenure has already shown how quickly things can change. He lost his first game to Mansfield Town but then won four on the spin, including a victory at then-leaders Stockport County when the fans sang his name.\n\nThere’s feeling among the fans that the club have prioritised the new 25,000-seat stadium project at Power Court over the football\n\nWilshere lost his first game to Mansfield Town but then won four on the spin, including victory at leaders Stockport County when the fans sang his name\n\nThey cheered the team off after a brilliant home win against Bradford this month, their best performance of the season, before their recent ugly run.\n\nBy the end of Tuesday night, the mood had lifted a touch again. A more dominant, attacking performance over Plymouth, albeit one requiring a late Jordan Clark penalty to win it after a calamitous error while, you guessed it, playing out from the back gifted the visitors an equaliser.\n\nThe last 18 months have hurt the bond between club and fanbase and now, at the heart of it, is a young coach trying to stitch it back together his way.\n\nWilshere once asked Mikel Arteta when he knew he was ready to take his first job in management. Arteta replied: ‘You just have to jump in and swim as hard as you can.’"

            "content": "The release of the latest season of Netflix's Drive to Survive has revealed the poignant moment former Red Bull team principal Christian Horner broke the news of his sacking to his Spice Girl wife Geri Halliwell.\n\nThe long-serving team boss was deposed midway through the 2025 season amid a suspected power struggle at the Thai-Austrian constructor, one year on from his sex texting scandal which set the Formula One world alight.\n\nHorner eventually left the team in July after receiving an £80million package, but while his departure sent shockwaves through the motorsport community, behind-the-scenes insight has revealed that Halliwell had an ominous inkling that her husband's Red Bull days were numbered.\n\nFootage in the docu-series' Red Bull-centric episode showed Horner opening up to his wife at the table in their kitchen's conservatory, with the 52-year-old starting the conversation with a downbeat 'hey darling'.\n\n'All... all done and dusted,' Horner confirmed as he kissed Halliwell on the forehead, before sitting down at the table and accepting a waiting latte.\n\nHalliwell looked visibly emotional as Horner gave her the scant details of his meeting, before asking: 'How do you feel?'\n\nChristian Horner was consoled by his wife Geri Halliwell after his shock Red Bull sacking\n\nThe former Spice Girl looked visibly emotional as her husband recounted how the team swung the axe after 20 years\n\n'How do I feel?' Horner wondered aloud. 'Um... I never imagined to be in this position.\n\n'Of course your immediate reaction when you get delivered a s*** sandwich like that is, like, f*** them. I've had something taken away from me that wasn't my choice, that was very precious to me.\n\n'But you thought it was going to happen. We came back from that Austria race and I remember you sat on the bed one night and went \"Something really bad's gonna happen\".'\n\nHalliwell confirmed that she had said that they were going to 'fire' her husband.\n\nScenes from the episode later showed Halliwell and Horner watching a race on television - a hitherto unusual way of experiencing raceday for the former team principal, who had held his role since 2005.\n\n'You haven't got any of the data here really!' Horner complained. 'Well, normally I would have a whole bunch of noise in my ears. So it's like you're blind.'\n\nHalliwell admitted that she now felt 'a bit sad watching this' as her eyes filled with tears.\n\nHalliwell, 53, was a semi-regular fixture on race weekend alongside her husband, often appearing in the paddock at the start and end of the season as well as at proximate races such as the British Grand Prix.\n\nLater in the episode the couple took the unusual decision to watch a race from their home\n\nThe moment was captured at Horner's luxurious mansion in Oxfordshire by Netflix's cameras\n\nHalliwell and Horner were frequent fixtures in the paddock throughout their relationship\n\nWhen in February 2024, the paddock was stunned by a leaked cache of suggestive messages purporting to be from Horner, Halliwell flew to Bahrain to take her husband's side.\n\nHorner was later accused of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour by a female member of staff, with an internal investigation led by KCs twice clearing him of wrongdoing. Halliwell supported him throughout.\n\nBack at their Cotswolds home, Halliwell tried to lift the mood by suggesting that Horner might be trying to 'eat his feelings'.\n\nIn improved spirits, the pair later horsed around by their swimming pool, with Horner pretending to be on the brink of throwing Halliwell in, before she admonished him, saying: 'You're such a t**t.'\n\nThe episode also saw Horner explain who he believes is responsible for his sacking, after speculation at the time suggested that star driver Max Verstappen and his father Jos may have played their roles.\n\n'His father has never been my biggest fan,' Horner admitted when asked if it had been the Verstappens who wielded the axe. 'He's been outspoken about me.\n\n'But I don't believe the Verstappens were responsible in any way. I think this was a decision that was made by Oliver Mintzlaff with Helmut (Marko) advising from the sideline.\n\n'Ultimately things changed within the business, the group, the founder died and after Dietrich [Mateschitz's] death I was probably deemed to have too much control.'\n\nIn the months since his sacking, Horner has eyed a return to the sport, sharing last week that he felt he had 'unfinished business in the sport' amid swirling links to rival constructors including Aston Martin.\n\n'But I am not going to come back for just anything,' Horner clarified at the European Motorshow in Dublin. 'I am only going to come back for something that can win.\n\n\n\n'I don't want to go back in the paddock unless I have something to do. I miss the sport, I miss the people, I miss the team that I built.'"

            "content": "Tom Brady mocked for 'embarrassing' fawning over Gianni Infantino as sycophantic sports stars line up to praise FIFA president\n\nFootball legends have been mocked for their 'sycophantic' praise of FIFA president Gianni Infantino 10 years on from his election.\n\nThrough their social media channels, FIFA posted fawning tributes to the controversial figurehead from some big names, including Tom Brady.\n\nThe Birmingham City co-owner and NFL icon said: 'I think Gianni is a man of the people and he's always out there celebrating the great parts of the sport. I think he's made great contributions to the world of football.'\n\nBrady's 'man of the people' line riled up a number of supporters, particularly in light of the exorbitant ticket prices at this year's World Cup.\n\nTickets to group games in next year's tournament hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico are three times more expensive than in the previous World Cup.\n\nThe cheapest seats at the final will cost £3,129 and there has been a huge backlash from fans - with Infantino insisting the prices simply reflect 'absolutely crazy' public demand.\n\nFIFA shared a number of tributes to Gianni Infantino, including one from NFL legend, Tom Brady\n\nBrady's praise led to one fan writing: 'That you had to make this montage of sycophancy then publicly post it, says more about Mr Infantino and the world's view of him than you appear to realise.'\n\nAnother posted: 'Tom Brady will literally shill for anyone at this point. Fanatics. Saudi flag football. FIFA. Doesn't matter.\n\n'Now he's calling Gianni Infantino a \"man of the people\" while World Cup tickets cost a mortgage payment and FIFA is wrapped in controversy.'\n\nThat was a sentiment also echoed by the comment: 'His \"man of the people\" Infantino has overseen a ticket price increase so drastic that most Americans won't be able to afford attending a World Cup in their own back yard. Literally would have been cheaper to go to the Euros, flights included.'\n\nOthers labelled the praise 'embarrassing' and a few claimed the FIFA president is worse than his disgraced predecessor, Sepp Blatter.\n\nThe love-in was not just limited to Brady. Francesco Totti was included in the compilation of praise, writing: 'He's an amazing person, a hard worker, someone who always wants to do his best for football. We're talking about a genuine competitive, well-rounded person, someone who is always available, always there for everyone.'\n\nLegendary Spanish defender Carlos Puyol added: 'I think he's doing a great job. He's trying to get football to grow.'\n\nAnd German World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus said: 'You can tell that he's very, very close to football, not only in his head but above all his heart. He's emotionally involved and it's wonderful, of course, that the president of a world association carries this sport in his heart like that.'\n\nInfantino, pictured this week during a trip to Colombia in a personalised hat, has been at the helm for a decade and FIFA's X account posted praise of their leader\n\nInfantino rarely misses an opportunity for self-promotion and the praise of his leadership was posted out to FIFA's 14.9 million followers on X.\n\nIt wasn't just former players gushing over the FIFA president. PSG head honcho Nasser Al-Khelaïfi wrote: 'Our FIFA Club World Cup, that's a huge success for me. Around $2billion in revenue in less than one year, so it was a big success for the clubs and for FIFA.'\n\nInfantino has been a divisive character during his decade in charge. He has been repeatedly criticised for his cozy relationship with US president Donald Trump, especially during the Club World Cup and World Cup draw, during which he awarded him a peace prize.\n\nThis week, Infantino batted down questions around Mexico's ability to co-host the World Cup this summer with cartel violence ripping through the country.\n\nChaos has engulfed Mexico in recent days after the army killed one of the world's most notorious drug lords, Nemesio 'El Mencho' Oseguera Cervantes.\n\nThat sparked a wave of retaliation across the country and forced the country's football federation to postpone a number of games over recent days.\n\nMexico is slated to host 13 games across three cities - Guadalajara, Mexico City and Monterrey - including the curtain raiser in Mexico City on June 11.\n\nFrancesco Totti was another 'FIFA legend' to share a tribute, calling him an 'amazing person'\n\nBut amid fears for fans' safety, Infantino insisted this week that FIFA is 'convinced everything will turn out for the best.'\n\n'I want to say from the outset that we have complete confidence in Mexico, in president [Claudia] Sheinbaum, in the authorities, and we are convinced that everything will turn out for the best.\n\n'From my side and from FIFA's side, I have absolute confidence in Sheinbaum.\n\n\n\n'We are in regular contact with the authorities, and we are, in any case, monitoring the situation. The World Cup is going to be an incredible celebration.'"

            "content": "Mauricio Pochettino breaks his silence on ongoing links to the Tottenham job - with US men's coach offering faint hope to 'emotional' fans amid his preparations for the World Cup\n\nMauricio Pochettino has played down swirling links to the vacant permanent managerial role at his former club Tottenham Hotspur ahead of taking the United States men's team to their home World Cup this summer.\n\nDespite leaving in 2019 amid a run of disappointing form, the Argentine manager remains a well-loved presence in north London - and in spite of his season-long spell at rivals Chelsea for the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nIn the years since leaving the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium too, Pochettino has variously entertained or ruled out the chance of a second turn in the dugout.\n\nBut for fans currently fearing the drop down to the Championship following the sacking of Thomas Frank and interim appointment of Igor Tudor, the US men's national team coach had a crumb of comfort to offer them when asked about the position on Wednesday.\n\n'There are always rumours, I'm always linked (to clubs),' Pochettino told Spanish radio programme Radiogaceta de los Deportes. 'To Tottenham, just like at one time I was linked to Espanyol, or to other clubs.\n\n'In the end, especially because of my past at those clubs, when things aren't going well, people tend to fall back on emotions and say, \"Well, with Mauricio we played good football,\" or whatever it may be.\n\nMauricio Pochettino has not entirely stamped out speculation that he could one day return to Tottenham as head coach\n\n'But no. We're focused on the World Cup, on the United States. My contract runs until after the World Cup, so after that we'll see what might happen.\n\n'Open to everything, right?'\n\nPochettino was invariably one of the names that sprung to mind following Frank's departure at the start of the month, despite his ongoing preparations with the US national team.\n\nBut while an immediate appointment would have been impossible, the manager is out of contract after the tournament, and believed to be interested in a return to club football in the future.\n\nPochettino also remains based in England, which could further factor into his decision when he plots his next move.\n\nHe has made no secret of his ongoing connection to Tottenham too, where he oversaw a run to the Champions League final in 2018, and a second-place finish in the Premier League one season earlier.\n\nBut Daily Mail Sport revealed earlier this week that as of yet, no formal nor informal contact has taken place between the two parties about a summer appointment.\n\n\n\nSince leaving the club nearly seven years ago, Pochettino has managed Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, before joining up with the US team in September 2024."

            "content": "AARON WAN-BISSAKA INTERVIEW: I was at my lowest point at Manchester United - I was lonely, homesick and went back to London almost every day. Then Erik ten Hag's mixed messages left me totally confused\n\nUnlock more of the best of our journalism with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight and the writers you love every day\n\nInside a private cinema room on the ground floor of a modern apartment block in Canary Wharf, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is enjoying something rarely afforded to professional footballers: a moment of peace and quiet.\n\nIt is his day off. Dressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, he sinks into a plush seat with the same composed demeanour that has defined his game. Afterwards, he says with a smile, the plan is simple: take a nap.\n\nThat understated presence has long shaped Wan-Bissaka’s identity, a player more comfortable letting performances speak for themselves than seeking attention. Now with West Ham after a formative spell at Manchester United, he is in reflective mood, revisiting a journey that has carried him from London estates to Old Trafford and back again.\n\nAs the conversation unfolds, the story is as much about family and sacrifice as it is about football. Long before the bright lights of the Premier League, Wan-Bissaka’s football education began on the patch of grass outside his childhood home.\n\n'I was probably age five when I first fell in love with football,' he says. 'It was just me and my brother in the estate playing around with a ball. We would go out to the green opposite our house to play. We'd call it our Wembley.\n\n'It didn’t really click until around 16, when I realised there was a genuine chance of becoming a professional. That’s when I saw the opportunity to put my foot down and properly chase the dream.'\n\nDressed in a new tracksuit and speaking softly, Aaron Wan-Bissaka is in reflective mood when he meets Daily Mail Sport\n\nThough Wan-Bissaka grew up idolising Thierry Henry, he has grown into a highly dependable, no-nonsense full back\n\nLike many London kids of his generation, his first football idol was Thierry Henry. 'I always wanted to be him,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'Honestly, I used to have this vision on me being him, and growing up to be that sort of player. He was my idol. I think it was because of his composure. He scored lots of goals but he also carried the team. He was a leader. My whole family were Arsenal fans when I was growing up, too.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s boyhood dream contrasts with his reputation as a no-nonsense defender, and the 28-year-old’s career was ultimately forged through family resilience and a demanding relationship with his father.\n\n'I didn't realise how much my parents were sacrificing for my dream to begin with,' he says. 'When I got into secondary school, which is the age when you start to want things like trainers and boots, I was quite demanding. But they would brush it aside and be like, \"You have to wait a couple of months\". That's when I realised that it wasn't easy for my parents to give me the things I was asking for.\n\n'They worked cleaning jobs to afford my boots and my dad would get in trouble for leaving work early to bring me to training.'\n\nHis father Ambrose’s influence came through discipline rather than praise. 'It was difficult because there was a language barrier between us. His English wasn't great and my French wasn't great so there were only a few words exchanged at times,' recalls Wan-Bissaka, who has now played nine times for the country of his father's birth, DR Congo. They will face either New Caledonia or Jamaica next month in FIFA's inter-confederation play-offs in Zapopan, Mexico, for a place at this summer's World Cup.\n\n'We mainly spoke about football. But he was always critiquing me or telling me what I could do better. It was never praise. I have to say, I found it confusing at the time. I always wondered why he wouldn't praise me. I used to question myself: \"Am I not doing enough?\"'\n\n'Even after I scored, I would come off the pitch and he wouldn't be pleased. I used to just think to myself, \"Is one goal not enough?\" But then as I got older I started to understand it. He just wanted me to test myself and become the best version of myself.'\n\nAfter taking to Premier League life with ease at Crystal Palace, where he won player of the year in his first full season in senior football, a £50million move to United soon followed. It was the biggest step of Wan-Bissaka's career - and one of the most challenging periods of his life.\n\nWan-Bissaka felt extremely homesick after making a big-money move to Manchester United. 'Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep,' he admits\n\nThe defender's positive relationship with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was a source of reassurance. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well,' says Wan-Bissaka of his former boss\n\n'When I moved to United, I really missed home, my family and friends especially,' he reveals. 'After training, I used to take the train back to London almost every day. It’s only about two hours, but it’s still a big commitment, and eventually it became exhausting, so I knew I had to stop.\n\n'It was something I wasn’t used to at all. I’d always been comfortable at home in London, surrounded by familiar people and places, so for everything to change overnight was difficult to adapt to. Most days I’d just be at home alone, playing PlayStation until it was time to sleep. I struggled. It was probably the lowest I’d felt.'\n\nWan-Bissaka’s big-money arrival from Palace in 2019 - which coincided with a first England call-up, though he was never capped due to injury - came with a mountain of expectation. But he quickly became a fixture in the United XI, starting more matches than any player across Europe’s top-five leagues in 2020-21.\n\nHis early relationship with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer offered reassurance amid his struggles off the pitch.\n\n'My relationship with Ole was good from the start,' he recalls. 'He’s a great person and we got along really well, and I think the rest of the players felt the same about him. He’s the kind of manager who backs you straight away. Once he gives you a job to do, it’s up to you to trust yourself and go out and deliver it.'\n\nManagerial turnover would later test that security, particularly under Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag.\n\n'Obviously, it’s football, every manager has their preferences,' he says. 'They might like you or they might not, and that’s just part of the game. When he (Rangnick) came in, it wasn’t the best period for me and there was a lot of criticism around…\n\n'It was difficult when Erik ten Hag arrived - as soon as he did, he told me I wasn’t in his plans. But when I tried to leave, he said he didn’t want me to go. I couldn't understand it. That was tough mentally, because it left me wondering what I was supposed to do next.\n\nWan-Bissaka initially struggled to gel as effectively with Solskjaer's successors, Ralf Rangnick and Erik ten Hag\n\nHis relationship with Ten Hag ultimately improved, and the pair lifted the Carabao Cup with United in 2023\n\n'I just kept my head down and told myself to keep training, keep improving, and play my game. Staying motivated was hard though, especially when you’re training without the clear goal of playing.\n\n'But the people around me guided me in the right way and encouraged me to keep going. Eventually things turned around and started to improve. You could say I changed or developed tactically under him, because that was something he wanted.'\n\nClarity, he says, is invaluable. And something the right back received from Michael Carrick. He speaks highly of United's recently-appointed interim boss, praising the simplicity of his messaging during his previous caretaker spell in 2021.\n\nNo wonder, then, that he backs Carrick to be given the permanent job after such an impressive start second time around.\n\n'He's someone you can trust,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'He will also trust you back if you buy into him and what he's looking to do. If you trust him, he will trust you.\n\n'He was quite simple in what he wanted from you. The boys were happy with him and the games he had when he was the manager. With him back at the club now, they are in a good place as a team. I think he should be given the full-time role. I think he deserves it.'\n\nIf Manchester represented pressure and growth, West Ham has provided renewal. The move back to London offered proximity to family and a fresh football environment.\n\nHis impressive form in his debut season saw him named 'Hammer of the Year' in May, beating out fan favourite Jarrod Bowen to the award.\n\nWan-Bissaka opens up to Daily Mail Sport's Charlotte Daly about his career - both the highs and the lows\n\n'At West Ham, I’ve been really happy with how things have been going,' says Wan-Bissaka. 'You can probably tell from the smile on my face'\n\nThough the club have struggled this season - sitting in the relegation zone with 11 games to go, despite an upturn in form under Nuno Espirito Santo - he has no regrets about making the move.\n\n'I was in two minds (about moving initially), to be honest,' he says. 'I had a year left on my contract, but I felt I needed to get back on my feet and start playing regularly - not just every couple of games.\n\n'Looking back on my time at Manchester United, I’m grateful for it. Those experiences made me who I am today and helped me both on and off the pitch, especially mentally.\n\n\n\n'With all the noise and scrutiny at a club like United, a change of environment can make a big difference. At West Ham, it’s not as intense… I’ve been really happy with how things have been going. You can probably tell from the smile on my face every day. I am playing with a smile too.'"

            "content": "How Erling Haaland's game has transformed in the absence of Man City wingers - and why Pep Guardiola is loving his new 'main character'\n\nUnlock more from Jack Gaughan inside the Manchester City camp with a DailyMail+ subscription - brilliant exclusives, in-depth insight, analysis and more\n\nThe look was perfect. Emile Heskey wore it so well, that strange cocktail of exasperated indignation. You’re asking me about Erling Haaland? Ah, come on.\n\nHeskey, sat on upholstered leather to bring an air of authority to proceedings – those proceedings being to goad an ex-professional into saying something inflammatory on video for social media, all in the name of betting advertising – briefly weighed up the question of whether Haaland is 'world class'.\n\nHe answered 'no' and then the edited footage cuts to the former Liverpool striker explaining why, presumably to somebody who raised surprise in an action that now had him all of a fluster. ‘World class? Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals. Tell me what he does apart from scoring goals.’\n\nHeskey knows a thing or two about goals of course, having registered one in five games at club level and one in nine for England during a career that saw him clean up at Birmingham City’s Player of the Year Awards in 2005.\n\nThese days he spends a bit of his time flogging CBD online but here we are instead focusing on his suggestion that Haaland is selling snake oil to anybody who thinks he’s an elite striker.\n\nHeskey’s sons, Jaden and Reigan, are both products of Manchester City’s academy and have regularly trained alongside Haaland, so are perhaps in a better position to determine the 25-year-old record-breaker’s skillset from the perspective of somebody who has seen him close up.\n\nErling Haaland chases down the ball against Newcastle last Saturday during a dynamic display in which he had his most touches yet in a Premier League match, at 43\n\nHaaland set up Nico O'Reilly for City's second goal. The Norwegian has three assists since City's formation switch\n\nTheir old man’s game was predicated on doing the donkey work, allowing others to grab headlines. He did this expertly by bringing midfielders into play, occupying defenders, creating channels for others, generally enjoying the physicality of the Premier League.\n\nThat description does bring a man to mind, actually. Long hair, Scandinavian. Fastest ever to 100 Premier League goals. Second in this year’s assist charts with seven, behind only Bruno Fernandes. Part of a leadership team handpicked by the great Pep Guardiola. Seems like a full package. World class, you might say.\n\nDiscussion around what Haaland does or does not do came back round last weekend, when City squeezed past Newcastle United. The best all-round performance of his career has been the shout from a section of observers and Wayne Rooney gushed over the nature of it. ‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ Guardiola said, having already held Haaland up as an example to his team-mates in the dressing room after the 2-1 victory.\n\nBasically the message was to remember what he put in for the cause, the commitment and desire, the sort of which is non-negotiable if City are to beat Arsenal to this title.\n\nHaaland ran, defended, hustled like a man possessed. He bundled Dan Burn about as if the giant defender was a rookie on the slight side. There he was, heading away a dangerous corner in the dying seconds. He didn’t score but assisted beautifully for Nico O’Reilly’s second, standing up a right-foot cross to the back post. Haaland admired it as O’Reilly headed in before darting off to celebrate with the scorer.\n\n‘You can see his joy when other people succeed,’ Norway head coach Stale Solbakken has told Daily Mail Sport. ‘That is big proof of what a team player he is.’ Some City players have been somewhat surprised by his collegiate attitude over the years; that attribute is partly why Guardiola handed him more responsibility last summer.\n\nHis numbers against Newcastle paint a picture. A career-high 12 duels. His most touches in a Premier League match, at 43. No City player completed more clearances, albeit that is dependent on which source and what they determine a clearance to be.\n\nHis average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush, which is a product of Guardiola going with two up front and a box midfield in recent weeks. ‘We’ll see what we do when the wingers (Jeremy Doku and Savinho) are back,’ the City manager said. ‘I think he adapted perfectly. I’m not telling Erling to play left back.’\n\nIt’s no coincidence that Haaland has three assists since the formation switch and is now only one from his league-best tally.\n\n‘It’s a performance I will never forget,’ City manager Pep Guardiola said of Haaland's efforts against Newcastle\n\nHaaland's average position by the centre circle was about 20 yards deeper than fellow forward Omar Marmoush (Phil Foden, Rayan Cherki and Abdukodir Khusanov were all substitutes)\n\nThese bits are significant indicators of a complete centre forward, more Harry Kane than Cristiano Ronaldo. And it is a trend. The conversations around how Haaland’s game has been transformed, doing more for the team and not ‘just’ scoring an inordinate number of goals, have now surfaced at least four times this season.\n\nThe draw at Arsenal. Beating United in September’s derby – before which Haaland was a central figure in a team meeting about raising standards and when he completed more defensive actions than that Newcastle match. And after a home win against Bournemouth. Each display prompted discourse about his style, the sort of which that has that guy at the end of the bar earnestly offering that Haaland’s not just about goals anymore, you know.\n\nThat this talk about an improvement outside of his recognised zone, between the posts, happens periodically and presented as new begs the question: has he actually always been like this?\n\nThe answer is yes and no, although it certainly looks to the naked eye that he has grown into a main character of City’s build-up play. And often that is more instructive than the raw stats. Heading and City relying upon his size is the main upturn – and a drastic one. This has been an area that Haaland’s worked on for a long while, particularly with Marco Rose at Borussia Dortmund, and one he knew needed elevating.\n\nWhile the number of aerial duels he battles in is only up marginally per 90 minutes, 3.9 now compared to 3.55 last year and 3.2 during his first season, City are seeing far better results. Haaland now wins 64 per cent of those, up from an average of around 50.\n\nHis dribbling statistics are on an upward curve, one deft slalom against Newcastle given the slow-motion treatment by City’s video team this week. He takes on more of those per game and completes 40 per cent.\n\nBut then there are the others. Winning back possession in the final third is better than last year but not as prevalent as in 2023-24. Passes played into the box is half of the Treble year. Expected assists are broadly the same as his other three campaigns, chances created from open play are actually lower than ever - even if through-balls are now far higher than his normal average.\n\nAverage number of touches – the metric that detractors became obsessed by – are lower than his first two seasons, 24 now and 27 in that blistering first term when plenty mocked his lack of general involvement. But this takes into account the whole season, not just the period that City have been wingerless. Anyway, it's a funny old game. He’d not felt the ball once before a 15th-minute opener in Monaco and nobody mentioned it.\n\nHaaland is now winning far more of his aerial duels: 64 per cent up from an average of around 50\n\nHaaland's stats for winning back possession in the final third are better than last year\n\nOften the sheer weight of goals distract from everything else and perhaps the amazement of those feats wearing off has seen pundits look for other things in his game to highlight.\n\nCertainly working for the team is nothing new, Haaland particularly pleased with a decoy run to distract Juan Foyth, allowing Bernardo Silva to score, away at Villarreal in October as a recent example, even if dropping deep is.\n\nRoughing up William Saliba and Gabriel in the 2023 title showdown with Arsenal is a memorable display of force and doing the dirty stuff, while Norway marvelled at the way he pressed, ran channels and held up possession as they secured a vital World Cup qualification win over Italy in June.\n\nTactically, they are seeing him have a greater awareness of what is required, especially against supposedly superior opposition. And that is maybe where this year’s difference comes: the statistics are similar but it’s learning how best to utilise those opportunities to the betterment of players around him.\n\nEven as the league’s top scorer on 22, there have been struggles. A barren spell in front of goal either side of new year is being worked through and he is still not entirely out of that yet. Coming out of the dressing room at Anfield in his sliders, Haaland insisted there was ‘no excuse’ for his form and he has still only scored one from open play in his last 10 league games.\n\nHe has refused to put this down to fatigue, even if Guardiola has labelled him ‘exhausted’ and attempted to give rest where possible, Haaland benched for victory over Wolves last month. Haaland is between houses at the moment, the family temporarily moving down near Crewe, and spent some of his three days off after Newcastle in Paris.\n\nLeeds United next, the city of his birth, as the first half of the run-in starts motoring. City undoubtedly need him to start scoring regularly now and Guardiola has spoken candidly about the pressures the club’s No 9 places upon himself.\n\nHaaland celebrates scoring against Fulham with Phil Foden but he only has one goal from open play in his last 10 league games\n\n'The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola says. ‘We won the Treble because he scored I don’t know how many goals'\n\n‘The problem with Erling is that he has to deal with his own numbers and expectations,’ Guardiola said. ‘That is the challenge for him. When your expectation is five goals a season, you can improve. We won the Treble because he arrived, he scored I don’t know how many goals (52), and the expectations are there.\n\n‘When you go four or five games without scoring, it is like “Oh what happened, what happened?” He puts a lot of responsibility on himself. He is a guy who desperately wants to help the team and the club. I always say to him not to put too much pressure (on himself).\n\n‘He knows how much we need him, he doesn’t want to leave the team disappointed. That is a big attribute. I would prefer that to somebody who doesn’t care. He’s completely the opposite, he suffers when he doesn’t score a goal. Don’t suffer, you do your best.’\n\n\n\nThe best will never be enough for some."

Existing FIA regulations have stated it will only be measured at an ambient temperature.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWolff has previously claimed this breakthrough will make minimal difference, suggesting the advantage may only be as small as two or three horsepower. This comment was rejected by Red Bull star Max Verstappen, who said \"you can definitely put a zero behind\" the numbers Wolff mentioned.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nWith the FIA also conducting an e-vote amongst the power unit manufacturers (PUMs) within F1 on whether to implement a new hot-temperature compression ratio test, Wolff maintained their engine has not justified the intense backlash it's attracted. During the second Bahrain pre-season test, Wolff said: \"We said it all along that this looks like a storm in a teacup.\n\n\"The whole thing, and numbers were coming up that were... if these numbers had been true, absolutely we would understand why somebody would fight it.\n\nF1 driver update after losing control in terrifying crash as marshals rush to help READ MORE :\n\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!

It doesn't change anything for us, whether we stay like this or whether we change to the new regulations, and that's been a process. But we also want to be good citizens in the sport because it doesn't make a big difference.\"\n\nAmong those who may be welcoming this vote is Verstappen, who remains unconvinced by Wolff's assessment. He made his viewpoint abundantly clear when presented with the Mercedes boss's remarks; the difference would only be around two or three horsepower.\n\n\"You can definitely put a zero behind that,\" Verstappen warned. If the figures are 20 to 30 horsepower, as the Dutchman has suggested, it could be worth approximately three tenths of a second per lap, which would represent a substantial advantage for Mercedes.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nView 2 Images Verstappen does not agree with Wolff's assessment (Image: Getty)\n\nHe also urged the F1 world to monitor Mercedes' pace in Australia, where the 2026 F1 season will be kicking off. He said: \"I understand what they're trying to do. They're trying to shift it to us because we did so many runs on Wednesday.\n\n\"I can tell you one thing – just wait until Melbourne and see how much power they have.

The coaches as well. I'm just out there looking to make the right play for my team.\"\n\nIt took Murray 80 games in 2022-23 to establish the record -- and Knueppel just 59 to surpass it. He said he did not realize the magnitude of the shot that set the mark.\n\n\"Honestly, I thought I needed seven,\" Knueppel said.\n\nGolden State's Stephen Curry holds the single-season NBA record with 402 3s.\n\nKnueppel is shooting 44.2% from beyond the arc, making him a contender for NBA Rookie of the Year along with his former college teammate and roommate Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 pick of the Dallas Mavericks. He has also helped propel the long-suffering Hornets into playoff contention; Charlotte has not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season.\n\n\"It's what elevates our whole culture when you have a guy that's that good, but that humble, no ego -- it becomes contagious throughout your whole organization,\" Hornets coach Charles Lee told CGTN Sports Scene after Knueppel eclipsed 200 3s on Tuesday night.\n\nKnueppel has been a perfect fit in second-year coach Lee's offense alongside playmaker LaMelo Ball by finding open spots on the court -- a skill he attributes to playing in his father's men's league against taller competition beginning as an eighth grader growing up in Milwaukee.\n\nKnueppel has thrived as a catch-and-shoot player with 93% of his 3s this season coming off assists entering Thursday night, according to Cleaning the Glass.\n\nHe has turned heads across the league with his high shooting percentage.\n\nCurry, the NBA's career leader in 3s, made 166 on 380 attempts as a rookie with the Warriors in 80 games in 2009-10. Knueppel has now attempted 473 3s.\n\n\"He can obviously shoot the ball at a high level,\" Curry said after a recent game against the Hornets. \"You can't really leave him open at all as he has such a quick release and shoots with confidence. And his playmaking is very underrated. His game just suits the NBA style, whether it's fast-paced or a slowed-down possession game.\"\n\nKnueppel surpassed Donovan Mitchell, who is third on the list of 3s made by a rookie, in a loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 20.\n\nMitchell joked that he heard about it after the game from Cavs teammate Tyrese Proctor, who played with Knueppel at Duke.\n\n\"He's talented,\" Mitchell said of Knueppel. \"For him to be a rookie and be able to go out there and make it look effortless. ... We know he can shoot the ball, right? But I think him getting to the midrange and play-develop in the small pick-and-roll that is something I think is really unique about his game is being able to do that and create advantages for himself.\n\n\"It's going to be interesting with him and Coop for rookie of the year.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."

His Buckeyes teammate Arvell Reese, the No. 3 player on Kiper's big board, also ran a 4.46 in the 40, tying them for the best times among all players who ran Thursday night.\n\nTo put Styles' vertical jump into context, it was better than Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson, who at 6-5, 239 pounds, had a 42½-inch vertical jump at the 2007 combine. Styles' jump was also better than current Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori, whose 43-inch jump was the best at the 2025 combine.\n\nStyles' broad jump was also best among all players who took part Thursday, and he was the only player among the defensive linemen and linebackers to top 11 feet.\n\nReese did not do any of the jumps in the workout, but did do position drills.\n\nStyles, who played almost exclusively at middle linebacker for the Buckeyes this past season, said earlier this week that he felt ready to show the league's personnel evaluators what he could do on the field.\n\n\"I think I would say that -- the great defenses you look at, there's at least two or three guys who can play a multitude of roles,'' Styles said. \"Like for example, this year for the Seahawks, Nick Emmanwori was a versatile player, and when you have guys like that on your defense, you're able to do a lot of different things as a coordinator.''"

Today I scored two goals, and that's what matters,\" Neymar told SporTV. \"That's football. One day you're no good or you're 'retired'; the next, people say you have to go to the World Cup.\n\n\"I'm dedicating myself and working to get in the best possible shape. This was my third game of the year and only my second full 90 minutes. I felt some cramping at the end, but that's just part of the process.\"\n\nNeymar underwent surgery at the beginning of 2026 and only recently returned to the field for Santos. Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti has said repeatedly that Neymar would be considered for selection for the World Cup if he was fit.\n\nAfter scoring the opening goal in the 25th minute, the Santos No. 10 celebrated by heading to the corner flag to perform the same dance Vinícius Júnior did after scoring in both legs of the Real Madrid's Champions League playoff matchup against Benfica.\n\n\"The little dance [I did] was for Vinicius Jr.,\" Neymar said.\n\n\"I told him, when he scored his first goal in Portugal, they insulted him, were racist towards him and everything else, I told him 'you score a goal and do the same celebration, if I score a goal, I'll do the same'. Vini, it's for you.\"\n\nVasco drew level before halftime, but Neymar scored again in the second half to put the game away for Santos.\n\nThe festive atmosphere for Neymar and Santos fans was briefly interrupted following a heated altercation with Vasco midfielder Thiago Mendes. The friction between Neymar and Mendes dates back to 2020 when a challenge from Mendes resulted in a serious injury for Neymar during a PSG match against Lyon.\n\nNeymar didn't hold back when discussing the confrontation.\n\n\"He always wants to cause trouble and act tough. He already broke me once at PSG, and he threatened me again today. It's always the same with him,\" Neymar said.\n\nThis brace marks Neymar's first goals since December 2025, when he closed out the previous year with a two-goal performance against Juventude."

            "content": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Division I football rules makers have proposed a one-year trial rule allowing a player disqualified for targeting for the first time to play in his team's next game regardless of which half the penalty was assessed, the NCAA announced Thursday.\n\nCurrently, players disqualified for targeting must sit out the rest of the game and, if the penalty occurs in the second half, sit out the first half of the next game.\n\nUnder the Division I Football Rules Subcommittee's proposal, a player disqualified for targeting a second time during the season would sit out the first half of the next game. A third targeting ejection in the same season would cause the offending player to sit out the entire next game.\n\nTargeting is forcible contact with an opponent's head or neck area in which the offending player often uses the crown of his helmet to make contact or launches his body into the opposing player above the shoulders.\n\nOversight committees for the Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision must approve proposals before they become official. Those committees meet next month.\n\n\"This continues the evolution of our targeting rule and balances the important safety impact with an appropriate penalty structure,\" said A.J. Edds, rules subcommittee chair and vice president of football administration for the Big Ten. \"We will closely monitor this one-year adjustment, and the committee believes it is important to enhance the progressive penalty to ensure proper coaching and player education.\"\n\nDress code:\n\nThe rules subcommittee proposed that players wear leg coverings from the top of their shoes to the bottom of their pants. Players would have to wear the same covering style and colors for that particular game.\n\nPlayers out of compliance with the rule would have to leave the game for at least one down and correct the issue. A team would receive a warning for the first offense.\n\nIf a team has a second offense under this proposal, the offending team would be given a 5-yard penalty. Any subsequent violations of the rule would result in a 15-yard penalty.\n\n\"The current look of the uniform is clearly not meeting the expectations of the college football community,\" Edds said. \"This will take a collective effort by administrators, coaches and officials to communicate expectations to players and equipment managers. This proposal, we believe, is definitive and gives us a chance for consistent enforcement across Division I football.\"\n\nTexas head coach Steve Sarkisian was amused by the proposal, saying, \"I'm just trying to figure out how we're going to police socks to pants.\"\n\n\"The NFL has that rule and they fine the players when they don't meet their uniform requirements,\" he said. \"Are we hiring uniform police that the NFL does, and they come and they assess every player and they dock them pay and they fine them for when they're suited properly? I would assume instead of worrying about socks to pants, are we going to tuck in our shirts? We've got T-shirts hanging out down to our knees now. There's a lot of things, but for that to come up as being an issue seems kind of odd.\"\n\nFair catch kicks:\n\nUnder a proposal, a team could choose to attempt a fair catch kick after a completed or awarded fair catch. The kick would be a field goal place kick with a holder or a drop kick from the spot where the returner caught the ball. The defense would be at least 10 yards from the spot of the kick.\n\nIf the ensuing kick goes through the uprights, it would be worth three points.\n\nSubcommittee members believe adding the rule would align Division I rules with those in the NFL and high school football. The rarely used play came up in 2024 in the NFL when the Los Angeles Chargers' Cameron Dicker converted from 57 yards against the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

(2:43)\n\nOpen Extended Reactions\n\nFor the third consecutive year, the Miami Dolphins ranked first in the NFL Players Association annual report cards, according to survey results obtained by ESPN. The Minnesota Vikings finished second, followed by the Washington Commanders in third.\n\n\"Players consistently describe the organization as 'the best in the NFL,'\" the NFLPA survey wrote about the Dolphins.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers finished last for the first time in the four-year history of the union's survey. Last year, the Steelers ranked 28th. The Arizona Cardinals finished 31st in the 2026 survey, after a last-place finish in 2025, and the Cleveland Browns finished in 30th, the same as in 2025.\n\nThe NFLPA is not making the report cards public this year after a grievance filed by the NFL, which said the survey violated the collective bargaining agreement. Earlier this month, an arbitrator agreed with the league, saying the report cards violated the CBA by \"disparaging NFL clubs and individuals.\" The NFLPA said it would continue to collect responses for report cards even if it can't publish them.\n\nA spokesperson for the NFLPA declined to comment.\n\nAn NFL spokesperson also declined to comment, saying that, as in previous years, the league had no knowledge of the survey. The league sent a memo to all teams later Thursday, saying that, as the arbitration hearing showed, the survey results are \"neither reliable nor scientifically valid.\"\n\n\"... We continue to recommend that clubs prioritize feedback and information provided directly by their own players rather than relying on the NFLPA's agenda-driven exercise,\" the league said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN. \"We further recommend that Clubs refrain from commenting or engaging publicly on the alleged survey and Report Card results.\"\n\nThe report cards grade franchises from A-plus to F-minus on everything from ownership to treatment of families. Per the survey results obtained by ESPN, this year's report cards are based on responses from 1,759 players. All players who were on a 2025 roster at the time of the survey were eligible to participate, and it was conducted from Nov. 2 to Dec. 11.\n\nThe Steelers received low grades in several categories, according to the results obtained by ESPN.\n\n\"[Steelers owner] Art Rooney ranks last in the league for willingness to invest in facilities, a trend reflected in the Steelers' poor facility ratings across the board,\" according to the survey.\n\nIn a new category added this year, the Steelers had the lowest-rated home field in the league \"by a wide margin.\"\n\n\"Players cite inadequate maintenance and excessive wear from hosting local college and high school games,\" according to the survey. \"Players across the league note the poor condition of the field and emphasize the need for investment to bring it up to standard.\"\n\nThe Steelers' locker room was graded an F. Players reported that it \"has only five bathroom stalls for the entire team.\"\n\nPer the survey, players report that the Steelers' training room lacks updated recovery technology and \"modalities.\" Pittsburgh's strength coaches ranked last in the NFL, though the training staff ranked first.\n\n\"We are not going to comment on a report that we have not seen in its entirety,\" Steelers senior director of communications Burt Lauten told ESPN.\n\nA spokesperson for the Cardinals declined to comment.\n\nMiami ranked fourth in home field because of the natural grass at Hard Rock Stadium, \"with players highlighting their preference for quality grass fields like this one,\" the survey said.\n\nFormer Miami coach Mike McDaniel's grade dropped from an A-plus to a B. \"Players identify scheduling, communication, and leadership as key areas for head coaching improvement, presenting an opportunity for [new head coach Jeff] Hafley next season,\" the survey said.\n\nLast year, 1,695 players leaguewide responded to the survey. The Vikings and Dolphins earned the highest marks for workplace environment, with owners Zygi Wilf of the Vikings, Stephen Ross of the Dolphins and Arthur Blank of the Atlanta Falcons receiving A-plus grades.\n\nBefore filing its grievance in November, the NFL had twice asked the union to suspend the survey, once in 2024 and a second time in June of this year -- and the NFLPA declined.\n\nAt the NFL league meeting in March 2025, New York Jets chairman Woody Johnson -- who along with Art Rooney of the Steelers, Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, Michael Bidwill of the Cardinals and David Tepper of the Carolina Panthers received ownership grades of D or worse in 2025 -- called the survey \"totally bogus\" and hinted that it violated the CBA.\n\nJohnson said he took issue with \"how they collected the information [and] who they collected it from. [It] was supposed to be, according to the agreement we have with the league. It's supposed to be a process [where] we have representatives, and they have representatives, so we know that it's an honest survey.\n\n\"And that was violated, in my opinion. I'm going to leave it at that, but I think there are a lot of owners that looked at that survey and said this is not fair, it's not balanced, it's not every player, it's not even representative of the players.\""

Therefore, England will avoid European champions Spain and world champions Argentina until a potential semi-final.\n\nWhile France, who beat the Three Lions in the World Cup quarter-finals in 2022, are unable to meet Thomas Tuchel's side until the final.\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

That means England and Scotland could be drawn together in the group stage.\n\nHowever, as a maximum of two European teams can be placed in each group, if England draw a European opponent from pot 2, Scotland will not be drawn with England.\n\nPlay-off hopefuls Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales are in pot 4 (see European Play-Off A, B, C below), with Northern Ireland and Wales battling for one spot in play-off path A.\n\nPot 1: Canada, Mexico, USA, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany\n\nPot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, Korea Republic, Ecuador, Austria, Australia\n\nPot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa\n\nPot 4: Jordan, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European Play-Off A, B, C and D, FIFA Play-Off Tournament 1 and 2\n\nWhat does this mean for the World Cup draw?\n\nThe draw for the finals will take place in Washington, DC, on December 5, starting at 5pm UK time.\n\nUS President Donald Trump will join FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the John F Kennedy Center - a performing arts venue where Trump is chairman - to decide the group stage fixtures. The draw will take between 45-50 minutes with a total show time expected of about 1 hour 20 mins.\n\nIt will begin with all the teams from pot 1 being drawn to groups A to L. It will then continue with pots 2, 3 and 4 in that order.\n\nFor pots 2, 3 and 4, each team's group position will be determined according to a predefined allocation pattern. A team's position within the group will then be determined by the pot from which they are drawn and by the group into which they are drawn.\n\nIn principle, no group will have more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it. This applies to all confederations except UEFA, which is represented by 16 teams. Each group must have at least one, but no more than two UEFA teams drawn into it.\n\nFor the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders, in order to comply with FIFA's general principle to ensure that no group has more than one team from the same confederation drawn into it, the confederation constraint will be applied to all three teams within each pathway of the two FIFA Play-Off Tournament placeholders in pot 4.\n\nPathway 1 of the inter-confederation play-off spots, which includes New Caledonia, Jamaica and DR Congo cannot be drawn into a group with Concacaf or African teams. While pathway 2, consisting of Bolivia, Suriname and Iraq, must avoid South America, Concacaf and Asia.\n\nAnnouncing the draw venue at the White House in August, Trump said the World Cup was \"the biggest event in sports\", while Infantino declared the 104 matches would be like \"104 Super Bowls\".\n\nForty-two teams have qualified for the 2026 World Cup so far, with a list below:\n\nDatawrapper Datawrapper , which may be using cookies and other technologies.

Parrott has had a huge say keeping his country's hopes alive of a first appearance at the World Cup since 2022.\n\nFor fans of AZ or the Eredivisie, it is perhaps no surprise. For others, the striker is often thought of as the Tottenham youngster who never quite hit the heights he was earmarked for.\n\nBut his career proves that the prospect of success does not end if you take a chance and leave the big Premier League club. In fact, it might lead one of the best moments of your life.\n\nTroy Parrott became the first hat-trick scorer in a competitive game for the Republic of Ireland since Robbie Keane in October 2014 (three goals vs Gibraltar), while he is the first player in the nation's history to score a hat-trick in an away match.\n\n\n\nParrott became just the fourth Republic of Ireland player to score two-plus goals in consecutive appearances (two vs Portugal and three vs Hungary), after Jimmy Dunne in 1936, Robbie Keane in 2013 and Callum Robinson in 2021.\n\nBeginnings at Spurs\n\nImage: Parrott was given his Tottenham debut by Jose Mourinho\n\nAfter beginning his career with Belvedere in his native Dublin, Parrott joined Spurs' youth ranks in the summer of 2017 at the age of 15.\n\nTwo years later, he signed a professional deal and began training with the first-team squad. He made his senior debut in a Carabao Cup loss to Colchester in September 2019.\n\nSome had compared him to Robbie Keane in his early career, while Parrott trained alongside Harry Kane in the same position. It restricted his opportunities and minutes, despite there being times when he was the only fit striker in the squad.\n\nDespite making his Premier League debut against Burnley in December 2019, he would make just one more substitute appearance in the competition for Tottenham under Jose Mourinho.\n\nThen came the well-trodden EFL loan track.\n\nLive Super Sunday\n\nStuttering EFL loans - but success in the Netherlands\n\nParrott had five loans in his time at Tottenham, four of them in England. His first to Millwall in August 2020 was hampered by injury, and it was curtailed when he was recalled in January with just 14 appearances and no goals.\n\nA few weeks later Parrott joined Ipswich, who were then in League One, scoring twice in 18 appearances.\n\nNext came season-long spells at MK Dons (2021/22) and Preston (2022/23). The former saw Parrott help the Dons to the play-offs, scoring in the semi-final second leg against Wycombe, but the club were beaten 2-1 on aggregate.\n\nImage: Parrott (left) spent time on loan at MK Dons\n\nBut with another underwhelming loan at Preston, the next move had to be a big one. Speaking to Sky Sports in October 2024, Parrott said: \"There have been seasons that I have had before where I have not enjoyed it too much\" - referencing his time on loan in the EFL.\n\nIt was time for Parrott look away from England, landing at Excelsior in the Eredivisie. Moving to the Netherlands proved to be the making of the young striker.\n\n\"The most important thing was to start enjoying football again without any pressure on it,\" the 23-year-old told Sky Sports. \"Not telling myself I need to do this, I need to do that. I know the talent I have so if I am feeling good in myself and happy then that is always going to show itself on the pitch.\n\nTroy Parrott's career record Games in all competitions\n\nTottenham - 4 apps, 0 goals\n\nMillwall (loan) – 14 apps, 0 goals\n\nIpswich (loan) – 18 apps, 2 goals\n\nMK Dons (loan) – 47 apps, 10 goals\n\nPreston (loan) – 34 apps, 4 goals\n\nExcelsior (loan) – 32 apps, 17 goals\n\nAZ Alkmaar – 61 apps, 33 goals\n\n\"But it was a big step because I did not have any idea what to expect when I first came over. Moving from Ireland to England is one thing but to move somewhere where they speak a different language, a different culture, it was always going to be a challenge.\"\n\nHe scored 17 goals for Excelsior in all competitions, with 10 of those coming in the league. Despite hat-tricks in both the semis and final of the two-legged Eredivisie play-offs - each scored at home - Parrott could not stop the club from being relegated.\n\nImage: Parrott scored two hat-tricks for Excelsior in the relegation play-offs, but they ultimately lost in the two-legged final\n\nDespite the disappointing end to the season, Parrott was finally showing the potential many had laid upon his head since he was a teenager at Spurs.\n\nSpeaking on his Excelsior loan, he said: \"The thing that helped me the most was that I realised I was a striker who needed to be in the box. On a couple of the loans that I had, I tried to show my ability to come deep and link play. A lot of the time, I was too far away from the goal to score.\n\n\"I worked a lot with the coach at Excelsior on just being in the box, being there when the ball is getting crossed. I think for me that was the biggest thing, just drilling it into my own head that ultimately you're a striker and you need to be in the box to score goals.\"\n\nFlourishing at AZ Alkmaar\n\nImage: Parrott (left) celebrates with Ruben van Bommel after scoring for AZ Alkmaar against Elfsborg in the Europa League\n\nHaving found a home in the Netherlands, Parrott made a permanent move from Spurs to AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2024 for a reported fee of £6.7m.\n\nReflecting on his time at Tottenham a few months later, he added to Sky Sports: \"No, I don't think I have any regrets. I am grateful for how the club treated me, helping me to grow up as a person and a player.\n\n\"Those expectations are hard for any young player. I'm speaking like I am old, I'm still young now! It is just the experience I had, being out on all the loans and stuff, is more than what I should have at this age. But it is something a lot of young players go through.\n\n\"I believe for me I've learned to just put that to the side. It does more harm than it does good. Just to block all that out. I am happy now, being able to showcase what I can do week in and week out at a big team playing in Europe. It is what I wanted when I moved here.\"\n\nParrott has kept up his standards with AZ. Last season, he scored 14 goals in 30 Eredivisie games - the league's third highest scorer. One of the highlights was four goals against Heerenveen in a 9-1 win in September 2024.\n\nHis form continued into the 2025/26 campaign, with 10 goals in seven games across all competitions, but found himself halted by a knee injury at the end of August. He has scored three more league goals since his return, with AZ four points ahead of Ajax in the Eredivisie table.\n\nSuch is his form, a return to the Premier League has been mooted in some areas, although he is contracted to AZ until 2029. Those transfer links will only have increased after his star turn in November's qualifiers.\n\nMore good times to come for Parrott and Ireland?\n\nImage: Parrott celebrates with his Ireland team-mates after their win against Hungary\n\nIn just two games this month, Parrott has doubled his international goals tally. Before stepping out against Portugal, he had scored five goals in 31 caps and only once since 2022.\n\nWhile he remains a regular call-up for the Republic of Ireland, he has been guilty of squandering chances with some of his good club form not quite translating to his country.\n\nNow, it appears the two have began to merge, and Ireland will need more of the same as they navigate a huge few months at the start of 2026.\n\nParrott rightly said he struggles to see how the night in Hungary can be bettered, but there are still the play-offs to come and maybe even a first World Cup. The good times can roll even further.\n\nGiven the momentum and confidence both Parrott and Ireland have after this international break, it would be hard to deny them more nights like Sunday."

            "content": "President John Mahama has announced that Ghana’s diaspora has become the country’s most reliable development partner, revealing that remittances from citizens abroad hit an unprecedented $7.8 billion in 2025.\n\nDelivering his State of the Nation Address to Parliament on Friday, the President described the figure as the \"largest annual inflow ever recorded in Ghana's history,\" highlighting the crucial role of expatriate Ghanaians in stabilizing the national economy.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, I'm also pleased to report that remittances from our relatives abroad, the Ghanaian diaspora, reached a historic high of $7.8 billion in 2025,\" President Mahama announced to the chamber.\n\nHe attributed the record-breaking inflow to a combination of confidence in the economy's direction and the \"enduring patriotism\" of Ghanaians living overseas. The funds, he explained, are having a tangible impact on the ground, filtering directly into the backbone of society.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, these remittances they bring back home, support households, they finance education, they build homes, they provide seed money for businesses, and best of all, they stabilize our foreign exchange position,\" he stated.\n\nThe President’s remarks underscore the growing importance of remittances as a pillar of the Ghanaian economy, often surpassing traditional foreign direct investment and aid flows. Unlike governmental or institutional financial support, these funds go directly to families and small-scale entrepreneurs.\n\nIn a striking comparison, President Mahama lauded the diaspora for their quiet but powerful contribution, noting that their support comes without the bureaucratic hurdles associated with international partnerships.\n\n\"In many respects, our diaspora has become one of the country's most reliable development partners,\" the President told Parliament.\n\n\"Without contracts, conditionalities, or fanfare, they are easily one of our most reliable development partners.\"\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

Patients facing medical emergencies must be received and given help, even under makeshift conditions.”\n\nTo address chronic shortages in healthcare capacity, the President announced a series of expansion projects, beginning with the Ridge Hospital Phase Two Project, which is set to increase bed numbers at the Greater Accra Regional Hospital.\n\n“In the meantime, government will expand capacity by implementing the Ridge Hospital Phase Two Project,” he added.\n\nHe further outlined ongoing and planned hospital projects across the country:\n\nPolice Hospital – continuation and completion.\n\n– continuation and completion.

They mobilised within three minutes and arrived at the scene by 10:35 pm.\n\nFrom then until approximately 12:50 am, EMT personnel reportedly negotiated with three hospitals to either admit the victim or provide treatment in the ambulance. The efforts were unsuccessful, and the victim died.\n\nHe was later identified as 29-year-old Charles Amissah, an engineer with Promasidor Ghana Limited at the North Industrial Area in Accra, producers of Cowbell milk and other food products.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "President John Mahama has served notice that his administration is shifting its focus from low-level perpetrators to the powerful financiers and orchestrators behind Ghana's devastating illegal mining crisis, known locally as galamsey.\n\nDelivering his State of the Nation Address to Parliament on Friday, President Mahama described illegal mining as a \"grave threat\" to the nation's environment, water bodies, public health, and national security.\n\nHe acknowledged that previous enforcement efforts have often failed to capture those most responsible.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, prosecution of persons engaged in illegal mining has been intense,\" President Mahama told the gathered lawmakers.\n\nHowever, he noted a critical flaw in past approaches, stating that efforts have been \"behind Galamsey operations, rather than targeting only the little fish, low-level offenders.\"\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, in all these Galamsey operations, there are big fish who never get caught,\" the President declared, signaling a significant change in strategy.\n\nTo address this, President Mahama announced the deployment of specialized prosecutorial teams tasked with accelerating the legal process and ensuring that justice reaches the upper echelons of the illicit trade.\n\nHe revealed that there are 140 communities, particularly towns and villages, that are highly prone to these illegal mining activities.\n\nThese new teams, he explained, have a specific mandate.\n\n\"Specialized prosecutorial teams have been deployed to fast-track illegal mining cases, ensure the effective presentation of evidence, and pursue the confiscation and forfeiture of equipment and proceeds used in or derived from illegal mining.\"\n\nThe President's statement signals a renewed crackdown on galamsey, which has for years wreaked havoc on Ghana's forest reserves and polluted river bodies.\n\nBy vowing to target the financiers and beneficiaries, the so-called \"big fish\", the government aims to dismantle the economic networks that sustain the illegal operations.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "Somalia has entered a crossroads marked by fragile security, fractured politics, dwindling external support, and a painful reality in which the terrorist movement Al-Shabaab poses a formidable threat. For 18 years, the group has waged war against the federal government. Yet the federal authorities in Mogadishu remain preoccupied with persistent disputes among Somali politicians, most recently over elections scheduled for May.\n\nA report by the International Crisis Group concludes that “it is unlikely Somalia’s elections will be held on time, and if delays persist, violence could erupt,” particularly as external support for combating Al-Shabaab comes under mounting pressure, with traditional security partners growing increasingly impatient with Mogadishu.\n\nAccording to the report, “under the presidency of Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, Somalia is being drawn into regional rivalries, creating the potential for further destabilizing proxy competition.”\n\nBrutal Incidents\n\nIn an assessment of Somalia’s security landscape between 2020 and 2025, the Hiraal Institute states that “more than 8,000 documented incidents were recorded,” pointing to “a tactical evolution by Al-Shabaab following the government offensive in May 2022—the year Hassan Sheikh Mohamud assumed office—the emergence of ISIS, Puntland’s independent military campaign against the group, and internal security challenges, including misconduct by security forces and clan violence.”\n\nIn its report published last December, the institute notes that “Al-Shabaab’s monthly attacks increased by 70 percent after the launch of security operations in May 2022, shifting from urban terrorism to rural insurgency. Targeting of civilians rose by 306 percent, while attacks on Somali army special forces increased by 1,764 percent.”\n\nNotably, “political disputes between the federal government and regional states—particularly Puntland and Jubaland—diverted military resources away from counterterrorism missions.\n\nAl-Shabaab’s 2025 counteroffensive reversed nearly all territorial gains and recaptured several towns.”\n\nThese political disputes revolve around President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s insistence on holding the anticipated May elections under a direct “one person, one vote” system, while Puntland and Jubaland adhere to the indirect electoral model based on clan representation that has been in place since 2000.\n\nThe institute’s report further observes that “Puntland’s military operation against ISIS demonstrates that effective counterterrorism remains possible when political will exists and resources are directed toward genuine threats.” The campaign reportedly carried out 364 operations against ISIS positions in the Al-Miskaad mountains, supported by Emirati and American airstrikes.\n\nYet a troubling indicator identified by the institute is the sharp escalation in internal security challenges: “incidents of brutality by security forces increased fourteenfold, and clan violence averaged more than 30 incidents per month in 2025.”\n\nThese indicators recall an assessment contained in a United Nations Security Council report published last October, which referenced “clashes between Jubaland forces and Somali federal forces in Beled Hawo, Gedo region, following the arrival of Abdirashid Janan, the newly appointed regional intelligence chief by the federal government and a known opponent of Jubaland President Ahmed Madobe. The clashes, which began on 22 July, continued intermittently until 11 August.”\n\nThe Global Conflict Tracker of the Council on Foreign Relations describes Al-Shabaab as “one of the strongest and most successful affiliates of Al-Qaeda,” noting that the organization continues to exploit the Somali government’s limited capacity and the country’s acute humanitarian crisis to launch indiscriminate attacks against government forces, foreign peacekeepers, and civilians.\n\nIt adds that the group’s objectives are “to destroy the Federal Government of Somalia and establish a Greater Somalia uniting all ethnic Somalis in East Africa under strict Islamist rule.”\n\nPolitical Fragmentation\n\nIn a further indication of the failure of Sheikh Mohamud’s policies, the International Crisis Group affirms that “during 2025, Al-Shabaab launched attacks and recaptured vast areas of central and southern Somalia that the government had controlled since 2023.”\n\nOne of the principal drivers of the current security crisis, the group’s report argues, is “political division—between the center and the periphery, and among Somali politicians themselves—which obstructs any coherent effort to develop the security sector and other effective institutions. At present, Puntland and Jubaland, two of the country’s strongest federal states, have effectively withdrawn from the federal system.”\n\nMeanwhile, President Sheikh Mohamud has sought constitutional amendments, including shifting from indirect elections to universal suffrage—moves many of his opponents regard as attempts to bolster his re-election prospects.\n\n“In the absence of agreement with the opposition, he will most likely be forced to postpone the elections,” the report continues.\n\n“If the government proceeds without broader public support, Somalia’s political fragmentation will deepen. More concerning still is the possibility that, as the government’s term approaches its end in May 2026 without a clear succession plan, opponents may mobilize supporters to pressure Mogadishu, potentially leading to violent clashes between government and opposition forces. Beyond the costs of internal political conflict, support for Somalia’s fight against Al-Shabaab could soon diminish.”\n\nThese circumstances coincide with an announcement by the World Food Programme that life-saving food assistance in Somalia may halt by next April unless new funding is secured, placing millions at risk of worsening hunger.\n\nAn estimated 4.4 million people face acute food insecurity, nearly one million of whom suffer from severe hunger, driven by failed rainy seasons, conflict, and declining humanitarian funding.\n\n“The situation is deteriorating at an alarming pace. Families have lost everything, and many are on the brink,” said Ross Smith, Director of Emergency Preparedness and Response at the programme.\n\nSomalia declared a national state of emergency due to drought in November 2025 following repeated seasons of insufficient rainfall, with other countries in the region likewise affected.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited.\n\nDISCLAIMER: The Views, Comments, Opinions, Contributions and Statements made by Readers and Contributors on this platform do not necessarily represent the views or policy of Multimedia Group Limited."

            "content": "President John Dramani Mahama has credited the Ghana Gold Board (GoldBod) as the key driver behind Ghana's significant boost in international reserves, now standing at US$13.8 billion, covering 5.7 months of imports.\n\nAccording to him, GoldBod's establishment has led to a surge in gold exports, with 103 tonnes exported in 10 months, generating over US$10 billion in forex inflows.\n\n\n\nThis initiative aims to strengthen Ghana's economic stability and assert sovereignty over its natural resources.\n\n\n\nAddressing Parliament in his State of the Nation Address on February 27, 2026, President Mahama said formalising gold exports has reduced smuggling and increased recorded exports in the Artisanal Small-Scale Mining (ASM) sector from 66.3 tonnes at the end of 2024.\n\n\n\n“Mr. Speaker, our reserves currently stand at US$13.8 billion, up from US$8.9 billion at the end of 2024. This covers 5.7 months of import cover. A key driver of this development has been the establishment of the Ghana Gold Board,” he explained.\n\n\n\nThe President stated that, with global gold prices projected to rise over the next three years, the country must build stronger reserve buffers to contribute to currency stabilization, inflation control, investor confidence, and household income support.\n\n\n\n“Mr. Speaker, when the cedi stabilizes, imported inflation falls, businesses can plan better, and household income will increase. As global uncertainties grow, it is necessary for us to reduce our country’s exposure to external shocks, break the cycle of economic downturn, and safeguard our macroeconomic stability,” he said.\n\nPresident Mahama also endorsed the Finance Minister’s introduction of the Ghana Accelerated National Reserve Accumulation, a policy designed to leverage the country’s gold to strengthen foreign exchange reserves and promote economic stability.\n\n\n\nThe initiative is expected to further boost Ghana's foreign exchange reserves, which have already shown significant improvement.\n\n\n\nMinister of Finance Dr Cassiel Ato Forson described the initiative as historic and a strategic shift toward a structured, gold-backed, reform-driven accumulation framework.\n\n\n\n“Gold as a strategic anchor central to the policy is a deliberate gold-backed reserve accumulation strategy, anchored on the Ghana Gold Board Act, 2025 (Act 1140), which mandates the Ghana Gold Board to generate foreign exchange and support gold reserve accumulation by the Bank of Ghana,” he explained.\n\n\n\nTo achieve this, the Finance Minister revealed that the government has set an operational weekly gold purchase target of approximately 3.02 tonnes, comprising at least 2.45 tonnes from the ASM sector and a minimum of 0.57 tonnes from the Large-Scale Mining sector."

On the same day he resigned, Atlas said he executed a Deed of Blind Trust, transferring his shares and completing all documentation ahead of his public appointment.\n\n\n\n“Since his resignation, Boateng has had no involvement in the management, decision-making, or operational activities of the company,” the statement added.\n\nIn a separate response, Ato Boateng said he had fully complied with public sector transparency requirements, declaring his interest in Atlas Commodities and the blind trust arrangement as part of his Assets and Liabilities Declaration submitted to the Auditor-General.\n\n\n\nHe further clarified that his department does not supervise Licensed Buying Companies (LBCs). Regulatory oversight of LBCs falls under the Deputy Chief Executive for Operations, while grading, sealing, and cocoa quality supervision are handled by the Deputy Chief Executive for Agronomy and Quality Control.\n\n\n\n“This means my office has no direct role in regulating buying companies,” he explained.\n\n\n\nAtlas maintained that it does not dispute the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest in public service but insisted that Ato Boateng’s resignation and transfer of shares removed any potential conflict before he entered public office.\n\n\n\nThe company concluded that the said allegations, taken together, do not reflect the facts and expressed confidence that a proper review would vindicate its position."

Trump’s arraignment — like most arraignments in the Manhattan courthouse — is a public proceeding, but news cameras are not usually allowed to broadcast from inside the courtroom.\n\nHowever, the judge is allowing five pool photographers to take still photos at the beginning of the proceedings “until such time as they are directed to vacate the jury box by court personnel.”\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump’s lawyers urged the judge to reject the media’s request for live cameras in the courtroom. The Manhattan District Attorney’s office told the judge they didn’t have a position.\n\nThe media outlets that tried to get cameras into the courtroom argued that “the gravity of this proceeding … and, consequently, the need for the broadest possible public access, cannot be overstated.”\n\nTrump is now in Manhattan ahead of the arraignment. A grand jury indicted the former president last week.\n\nThe arraignment is also expected to bring the unsealing of the criminal charges against Trump, which have not yet been seen by his lawyers or the public.\n\nThe indictment stems from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation into hush-money payments, made during the 2016 presidential campaign, to women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which he denies.\n\nTrump denies all wrongdoing and his lawyers said last week that they’ll fight to get the charges dropped."

(Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)\n\nThe Ukrainian military has reported little change to the front lines but heavy fire from Russian forces at various parts of the front line in the Donetsk region.\n\nThe General Staff said that more than 45 enemy attacks had been repelled over the past day, with the focus on Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Mariinka.\n\nIt said there were 17 air strikes and more than 20 strikes by multiple launch rocket systems.\n\n“In the Bakhmut direction, the enemy is trying to take full control over the city of Bakhmut and continues to storm it,” the General Staff said.\n\nWest of the city, Ukrainian defense forces repelled about 20 enemy attacks, according to the General Staff.\n\nOleksandr Syrskyi, commander of Ukrainian Land Forces, posted on Telegram that in Bakhmut he had met with “soldiers and commanders who destroyed the myth of invincibility of the Wagner fighters and Russian paratroopers.”\n\n“The enemy is weakening and trying to cover up its failures with new fakes about the capture of Bakhmut,” Syrskyi said.\n\nSyrskyi referenced the possibility of a future counter-offensive, saying that “the forward movement of our entire army depends on what every soldier is doing right now on their section of the front.”\n\nSome of the most intense fighting is to the northwest and west of the city of Donetsk – as the Russians continue months-long efforts to dislodge Ukrainian defenses in Avdiivka and Mariinka. The General Staff said that some 20 assaults had been repelled.\n\n“There are also some operational successes of our military in the Donetsk area. Our military have taken some positions. They have taken a more strategic and favourable position,” said Oleksii Dmytrashkivskyi, spokesperson for the military in that zone.\n\nHe also noted that Russian special forces had been introduced in the area.\n\n“The enemy is trying to attack our positions between Avdiivka and Marinka. These attempts do not stop. It should be noted that the enemy has suffered quite significant losses,” Dmytrashkivskyi said.\n\nHe also claimed that the Russians “don’t have the same amount of equipment and, as they themselves say, they are on a ‘diet’ of ammunition for assaults.”\n\nSocial media video showed both sides engaged in heavy fire in the Avdiivka area, which the Russians have surrounded on three sides.\n\nDenis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, claimed that Russian forces were still advancing in the Avdiivka direction.\n\n“It is still premature to speak of encirclement, but the situation is being created, if not critical, then extremely difficult for the enemy… After clearing Kamianka, our units are moving further. There are difficulties both with the terrain, which must also be overcome, and there are also similarities with weather conditions. But these difficulties are mutual — both for the enemy and for us,” Pushilin said."

            "content": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Chinese spy balloon that transited the US earlier this year was able to capture imagery and collect some signals intelligence from US military sites, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN.\n\nThe balloon was able to transmit information back to Beijing in real time, the source said, and the US government still does not know for sure whether the Chinese government could wipe the balloon’s data as it received it. That raises questions about whether there is intelligence the balloon was able to gather that the US still doesn’t know about.\n\nStill, the intelligence community has not been overly concerned about the information the balloon was able to gather, the person said, because it is not much more sophisticated than what Chinese satellites are able to glean as they orbit over similar locations.\n\nA US intelligence official told CNN on Monday that “although analysis of the wreckage of the High Altitude Balloon remains ongoing, thus far, its flight over the United States does not appear to have provided critical new insights to the People’s Republic of China.”\n\nThe US also knew what the balloon’s path would be and was able to protect sensitive sites and censor some signals before the balloon was able to pick them up, officials have said.\n\nAs CNN has reported, the US intelligence community last year developed a method of tracking what it says is a fleet of these Chinese balloons operating across the globe, controlled by the Chinese military.\n\nThe FBI is still examining the balloon, but so far officials have been able to glean additional information about how the device worked, including the algorithms used for the balloon’s software and how it is powered and designed.\n\nCNN has reached out to the National Security Council at the White House and the Pentagon for comment. NBC was first to report on the new intelligence.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33 • Source: CNN Justin Trudeau on what the world needs to do to handle China's threats 01:33\n\nThe balloon first crossed into US airspace over Alaska in late January before passing through Canada and down into Montana, where it hovered for a few days, leading the US to believe it was trying to surveil sensitive military sites, like Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. It was eventually shot down by the US off the East Coast on February 4, and the incident further escalated tensions between Washington and Beijing, including the postponement of a diplomatic visit by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.\n\nA senior State Department official said in February that, as the balloon floated across the US, it “was capable of conducting signals intelligence collection operations.”\n\nGen. Glen VanHerck, the commander of US Northern Command and NORAD, said at the time that the US “did not assess” that the balloon “presented a significant collection hazard beyond what already exists in actionable technical means from the Chinese.”\n\nThe surveillance program, which includes a number of similar balloons, is in part run out of the small Chinese province of Hainan, officials told CNN. The US does not know the precise size of the fleet of Chinese surveillance balloons, but sources tell CNN that the program has conducted at least two dozen missions over at least five continents in recent years.\n\nRoughly half a dozen of those flights have been within US airspace, although not necessarily over US territory, according to one official familiar with the intelligence.\n\nChina has maintained that the balloon was actually just a weather balloon thrown off course, and the US has been assessing the possibility that it was not deliberately maneuvered into the continental US by the Chinese government, CNN has reported.\n\nStill, China did maintain some ability to maneuver the balloon, officials believe. And once the balloon was over Montana, China appeared to take advantage of its position to loiter over sensitive sites and try to collect intelligence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting."

            "content": "The new year is less than two months in, but already more than 560 people have gone missing in the Mediterranean Sea while trying to reach Europe, making it on course to be one of the deadliest years on record. At least 500 of those were lost crossing from Libya, Tunisia and Algeria to a Europe that continues to attempt to force them back.\n\nThe stories of those lost at sea, many of them travelling on boats that offer little protection from the waves, reveal the extent of their suffering.\n\nEarlier in February, 53 people, two of them babies, were reported to be dead or missing after their boat capsized off the coast of the Libyan town of Zuwara. Only two women, both Nigerian, were rescued.\n\nA few weeks earlier, as a freak cyclone tore across the Mediterranean Sea, hundreds, possibly up to a thousand people, desperately trying to reach Europe, were believed to have lost their lives.\n\nQualified risk\n\nThe risks of travelling to and through Libya are well known among migrants and refugees. Nevertheless, they come.\n\nAccording to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration (IOM), between August and October 2025, at least 928,000 migrants were identified in Libya, hoping to either stay in the North African country or, in the case of many, attempt to cross to Europe and the promise of a better life.\n\nBut, as they wait for the funds to pay for their passage, or the right opportunity to travel, they find themselves prey to the militias that have controlled much of Libya since a civil war robbed the country of a stable and unified government.\n\n\n\nA report, issued by the UN Human Rights Office in February, painted a bleak picture of life for refugees and irregular migrants in Libya. In it, researchers described an environment where traffickers and armed groups could conduct widespread and systematic abuse against migrants with impunity. These “grave violations and abuses have evolved into deliberate, profit-driven practices that together form a ruthless and violent business model”.\n\nOla, a 25-year-old from Freetown in Sierra Leone, is one of the thousands to have fallen victim to Libya’s militias. Speaking from Libya’s capital Tripoli, Ola described being beaten and held prisoner by one of the militias in Zuwara, which is in western Libya.\n\nOla said that his hand had still not recovered after he was hit with an iron bar before he was detained in the summer of 2024. Ola remained in detention, enduring forced labour and regular beatings, for three months: the time it took his parents to borrow the $700 his captors demanded to free him.\n\n“Conditions were very bad,” he said of his time in detention, as he rubbed his injured hand. “There was a lot of suffering. We would have bread to eat, and sometimes we had to drink the water they gave us to wash in. It was very bad; it had salt in it.”\n\n“I did not have a [reputation for taking risks] in my country,” Ola said.\n\n“I did not associate with bad people. I never did anything illegal,” he continued. “I know this is dangerous, but it’s better than where I come from”.\n\nMubarak, a 31-year-old from Sudan, is no different. He fled fighting around his village near Nyala in Darfur in 2023, crossing into Libya overland through Chad. Like Ola, Mubarak described being held prisoner, being beaten and forced to work by one of Libya’s militias, before being released.\n\nMubarak also knows the risks of continuing to Europe and is ready to accept them. He laughed bitterly, “I know the crossing [to Europe] is dangerous. [But] It’s just the money that’s stopping me. I know in my soul that Libya is just as dangerous as Sudan, but where will I go?”\n\nNo deterrence for the desperate\n\nFor those willing to stake their lives on surviving what the IOM says is the world’s most dangerous migration route, European deterrence means little.\n\nNevertheless, the European states most exposed to departures from Tunisia and Libya, principally Italy, have adopted increasingly punitive measures. Under a new Italian bill approved earlier this month, the country can indefinitely prohibit boats from entering its waters “in cases of grave threats to public order or national security”.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the bill allows Italy to stop boats and send passengers to third-party countries it has outsourcing deals with, such as Albania, with no indication that authorities would check for protection needs, vulnerabilities, or physical or mental health concerns. The European Parliament has also signed off on changes to EU asylum rules that let member states transfer asylum seekers to “safe third countries”.\n\nHow effective all of that is at reducing migrant numbers remains to be seen. Despite an Italian government elected partly on the back of its anti-migrant platform in 2022, arrival numbers remain stubbornly high, with more than 63,000 people braving the odds in 2025, almost the identical number as those from the previous year.\n\n“Why people take these extreme risks is one of the big questions,” said Ahlam Chemlali, a migration expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, who has conducted extensive field research among irregular migrants along Tunisia’s border with Libya,\n\nChemlali described speaking to the women in the border region, who knew and, in many cases, had experienced the danger inherent to migration firsthand.\n\n“They told me they were already dead there [on the border], and they’re right. It’s a social death, where people have no future,” she said, “Everything is denied to them, so taking these risks is one way they can regain some control over their lives. They understand what they’re doing. The EU has poured millions into information campaigns, but the prospect of being stuck in limbo with no future feels worse. This is especially true for women with children. The presence of children can be a huge motivator, but of course, it also increases the risks.”\n\nIn Ola’s case, the drive to reach Europe is unwavering. He craves the rule of law – anything that would lead to consequences for those committing acts of violence against him.\n\n“Life in Europe would be amazing,” he said, the tone of his voice lightening, “I would be safe. There is no violence there. If there is violence, it is punished by the law.\n\n“I will educate myself and then get a job.”"

By contrast, before the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel in October 2023 and the ensuing genocidal war waged by Israel in Gaza, 54 percent of Americans sympathised more with Israel and 31 percent with Palestine.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the report’s main findings:\n\nDemocrats ’ sympathies haven’t changed significantly over the past year, having already flipped strongly towards the Palestinians in 2025 after first tilting that way in 2023.

Currently, 65 percent of Democrats say their sympathies lie more with the Palestinians, while 17 percent say they sympathise more with the Israelis. Driving the shift this year, the report says, is the substantial movement among independents who have now joined Democrats in supporting Palestinians. By 41 percent to 30 percent, independents say they sympathise more with the Palestinians than the Israelis, whereas in all prior years, they were more sympathetic towards the Israelis, including by 42 percent to 34 percent last year.\n\nwho have now joined Democrats in supporting Palestinians. Seven in 10 Republicans say they sympathise more with the Israelis, while 13 percent go with the Palestinians. Still, the Republican support for Israel has declined by a 10-point record since 2024, to its lowest level since 2004. Support for Israel has become deeply contentious in the conservative party, including driving a wedge within the far-right conservative MAGA movement. Some of its representatives, such as former Fox news host-turned popular podcaster Tucker Carlson, have become critical of what they say is Israel’s excessive influence over US politics.\n\nsay they sympathise more with the Israelis, while 13 percent go with the Palestinians.

Age gap : For the first time in Gallup’s surveys since 2001, a majority of US citizens aged between 18 and 34 are more sympathetic to the Palestinian people. Meanwhile, 23 percent of young adults say they sympathise more with the Israelis, a record low for the age group. Sympathy for Israel has dropped from 45 percent last year to 28 percent. Among adults older than 55, 49 percent sympathise more with the Israelis and 31% with the Palestinians, the first time since 2005 that less than half of older Americans have said they sympathise more with the Israelis.\n\n: For the first time in Gallup’s surveys since 2001, a majority of US citizens aged between 18 and 34 are more sympathetic to the Palestinian people.

Gallup also measured US sentiment over the establishment of a Palestinian state. There are no significant changes compared to recent years, as 6 in 10 adults favour the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank and Gaza – an almost consistent figure since 2020.\n\n\n\nPerceptions’ shifts followed what has been widely regarded as Israel’s disproportionate response to the October 7 attack, where about 1,200 people were killed in Israel and more than 250 were taken captive.\n\nIsrael has killed more than 72,000 people in Gaza, the majority of them women and children, and reduced almost the entire enclave into rubble.\n\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for crimes against humanity and war crimes; and prompted South Africa to file a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which has been joined by several other nations.\n\nStill, while support fell at a faster rate following the war, the trend had started going downwards since 2019 due to the “cumulative effect of gradual changes in US attitudes since then”, read the report."

            "content": "Australia’s Jack Doohan says he received death threats before he was dropped by F1 team Alpine, six races into last season.\n\nJack Doohan says he received death threats and had to call police to resolve an encounter with armed men at about the time of last year’s Miami Grand Prix, just before he lost his Formula One drive with Alpine.\n\nThe Australian driver said in the latest series of Netflix documentary Drive To Survive, released on Friday, that he had been threatened by email, describing the atmosphere around what proved to be his final race as “pretty heavy stuff”.\n\nDoohan made his debut for Alpine in the last race of 2024 and was dropped and replaced by Franco Colapinto after Miami, the sixth race of 2025. He is now a reserve driver for Haas.\n\n“I got serious death threats for this Grand Prix, saying they’re going to kill me here if I’m not out of the car,” Doohan said in the documentary. “I had six or seven emails saying if I’m still in the car by Miami, that I’ll be, you know, all my limbs will be cut off.”\n\nDoohan also described an incident where he saw three “armed men”, adding that “I had to call my police escort to come get it under control”.\n\nHe did not specify how that incident was resolved, and did not identify anyone responsible.\n\nAfter Colapinto replaced him at Alpine in May, Doohan posted on social media that he and his family had been facing online abuse, and indicated at the time that fans from Colapinto’s home country of Argentina were responsible.\n\nThe duo were the only two drivers in F1 last season not to score a point as Alpine finished last in the constructors’ standings."

            "content": "Latest Epstein files released in January reveal the extent of his relations with some prominent African leaders.\n\nThe latest tranche of documents released by the United States Department of Justice on the convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein has caused an uproar and a slew of resignations by senior officials and businesspeople across the US and Europe.\n\nIn Africa, the more than three million emails, photos, and videos released on January 23 are also causing some aftershocks as they reveal the extent of Epstein’s connections with prominent African figures, though appearing in the Epstein files does not automatically indicate a crime or wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to the documents, Epstein had ties with former South African President Jacob Zuma; Karim Wade, a politician and son of Senegal’s ex-president Abdoulaye Wade; and deceased Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.\n\nThe new files also shed more light on Epstein’s connections to a relative of Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, who appeared to connect the two men. This connection reportedly opened the door for a friend of Epstein’s, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, to propose a mass surveillance system to Ouattara that would work in the West African country. It is unclear if such a system is in place now.\n\nEpstein’s possible fixing role culminated in a formal 2014 security deal between the two countries, although the details of it are scant.\n\nThe revelations, in general, underscore the range of Epstein’s influence on powerful figures across continents.\n\nEpstein, who was first convicted in 2008 on charges of sex trafficking, was found dead by suicide in his prison cell in 2019 while awaiting a trial on sex trafficking charges. His ex-girlfriend and co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, was convicted and sentenced in 2021.\n\n\n\nHere’s what we know about the Ivory Coast deal and his ties to Africa’s political elite:\n\nIsrael and Ivory Coast: The context\n\nDiscussions between Ouattara and Barak appeared to start in mid-2012, after the Ivorian president travelled to Jerusalem for talks with Israeli leaders, presumably in hopes of striking a security agreement. Ouattara met Barak, who was then the Israeli defence minister, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFive days before the trip, on June 12, 2012, exiled military officials linked to the Ivory Coast’s former president had attempted to overthrow Ouattara’s government.\n\nOuattara’s predecessor, Laurent Gbagbo, had refused to hand over power to Ouattara, and a civil war that killed at least 3,000 people ensued. The fighting had only ended about a year before when UN and French forces intervened and arrested Gbagbo.\n\nOuattara’s son, Dramane, and niece, Nina Keita, also met Epstein in New York on the same day, according to the Epstein files. It’s unclear what the parties discussed.\n\nKeita, a former model, was friends with Epstein and travelled regularly on his private jet, according to the documents. She appeared to have connected Epstein with her uncle, as well as other highly placed Ivorian politicians, according to the documents.\n\nThe files showed that on September 12, three months after Epstein met Ouattara’s son, he again met Keita in New York.\n\nHe met Barak immediately after in a private meeting at the Regency Hotel in New York, according to a schedule published in the files. It’s not known what was discussed.\n\nIn November, Drop Site News reported that Epstein referred to a trip to the Ivory Coast, Angola and Senegal in a note to his assistant, but that there are no flight records to confirm the travels.\n\nWhat did Israel propose to Ouattara?\n\nA month after Ouattara’s travel to Jerusalem, an Israeli delegation visited Abidjan.\n\nAt the meetings, Ouattara reportedly asked about Israeli defence systems to overhaul security in his country, according to reporting by Calcalist, an Israeli publication that covered the exchanges at the time.\n\nIn late 2012, Ivorian Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko travelled to Tel Aviv for a meeting with Barak, where they discussed a cybersecurity deal, Drop Site News found.\n\nThen, in spring 2013, Barak, who had now left office as defence minister, travelled to Abidjan himself to converse with Ouattara in what would be their second meeting.\n\n\n\nBarak presented an expensive security defence plan to the president, Calcalist reported. The $150m proposal encompassed border security, army training, and strategic military consulting, the publication said.\n\nDrop Site News, in an investigation in November, added that the proposal included a mobile and internet surveillance centre, as well as a video monitoring centre.\n\nThe publication cited two sets of documents: an archive of leaked emails released by the Handala hacking group and hosted by nonprofit whistleblower site, Distributed Denial of Secrets, as well as earlier Epstein-linked documents released by the US House Oversight Committee in October 2025.\n\nBarak’s surveillance centre was to be developed by the French-Israeli private security company, MF-Group, which specialises in surveillance systems, and was to be located in Abidjan, Drop Site News reported.\n\nEmail logs showed Epstein introduced Barak to Ouattara’s chief of staff later in September 2013, and planned a meeting in New York where the two men met.\n\nAlthough Ouattara was pleased with the plan, he ultimately did not sign the deal because of the price tag, Calcalist reported.\n\nBarak, in a response to Calcalist at the time, denied that he offered to build the Ivory Coast an intelligence apparatus. “The claims about establishing an intelligence apparatus and price offers are incorrect. These are private conversations, and the public has no interest in them,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nWhat was the final agreement?\n\nAlthough the plan appeared to be rejected, both countries continued to forge friendly ties.\n\nIn June 2014, then-Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman was welcomed in Abidjan on a state visit.\n\nLiberman had travelled to the country along with 50 Israeli businesspeople who were interested in investing in the Ivory Coast.\n\nIn a news release at the time, the Ivorian government said two agreements were signed: “One concerning regular consultations between the two countries and the other on defence and internal security.”\n\nNo details were provided. It is not known if Abidjan is using Israeli surveillance security systems.\n\nNevertheless, the Israeli-Ivorian security relationship has continued, with the latter buying military vessels, aircraft, and armoured tanks from Israeli weapons companies.\n\nIn 2016, a United Nations report found that Israeli firm Troya Tech Defence had sold weapons and night vision goggles to Ivory Coast in 2015, violating a UN arms embargo that was in place at the time.\n\nIn 2018, an investigation into Israeli spyware Pegasus, developed by the NSO Group, revealed that the malware had targeted journalists’ phones in the Ivory Coast. Pegasus, believed to be used by governments, was found to be operating in 45 countries.\n\nIn March 2023, privately owned Israel Shipyards, which builds naval vessels, delivered two offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) to Abidjan.\n\n\n\nCritics of President Ouattara say the Ivory Coast has slid further from democracy under his rule and point to incidents like the Pegasus scandal, among other issues.\n\nDid Epstein and Barak strategise about other African countries?\n\nBarak also tried to leverage the Boko Haram crisis in Nigeria for a security deal, according to Drop Site News, citing the new documents.\n\nEpstein was aware of Barak’s business deals and advised him on doing business in Nigeria between 2013 and 2020, according to email exchanges.\n\nBoth saw the escalating violence in the West African nation not as a humanitarian crisis, but as a business opportunity, the publication found.\n\nIn June 2013, Barak attended a cybersecurity conference in Abuja, which organisers said privately was a pretext to meet Nigeria’s then-President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nIt came after Nigeria awarded Israeli firm, Elbit Systems, a controversial contract to surveil digital communications in the country. Public outrage caused Jonathan to consider cancelling the project, but the government never announced that it was withdrawn.\n\nBarak continued leveraging his access in Nigeria to promote Israeli products and services. In 2015, he facilitated the sale of Israeli biometric surveillance equipment to a private Christian university in Nigeria, Drop Site News found. The university, in a statement, denied the sale.\n\nIn 2020, the World Bank selected Barak’s intelligence firm, Toka, and the Israeli National Cyber Directorate to advise Nigeria on designing its national cyber-infrastructure.\n\nEpstein, meanwhile, also facilitated high-level access for Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, ex-chairman of the Emirati firm DP World. In 2018, Epstein connected bin Sulayem with Jide Zeitlin, then-chair of Nigeria’s sovereign investment fund, for discussions on securing port ownerships in Lagos and Badagry.\n\nBin Sulayem, last March, visited Nigeria and proposed that DP World establish industrial parks at Nigerian ports. The proposal has not been approved.\n\nJacob Zuma\n\nThe new files revealed that Epstein had some relations with former South African President Jacob Zuma, who led the country from 2009 until 2018.\n\nEpstein appeared to arrange a “small dinner” on behalf of Zuma in March 2010 at the Ritz Hotel in London.\n\nIt’s unclear what the purpose of the dinner was, but emails released as part of the Epstein files seemed to show that a Russian model was invited. The model was told her presence would “add some real glamour to the occasion”, according to emails sent by Epstein’s planner, whose name was redacted in the files.\n\nIn a different email, Epstein appeared to share that information with British politician Peter Mandelson, who is now under investigation for his links to Epstein. A host, whose name was redacted “is having dinner for zuma tomorrow night at the ritz„ i have invited a beautiful russina named (redacted) to attend,” he wrote.\n\nIt’s unclear if Mandelson responded.\n\nAfter the dinner appeared to have taken place, one email sender whose name was redacted wrote to Epstein: “(Redacted name) was a delight last night and enchanted all those she met…By the way, Jacob Zuma was much more impressive and engaging than I thought he would be!”\n\nKarim Wade\n\nPolitician and son of Senegal’s ex-President Abdoulaye Wade, Karim Wade’s name appeared 504 times in the released files.\n\n\n\nWade, under his father, was a minister with an open-ended portfolio, and was so powerful that he was nicknamed “minister of heaven and earth”.\n\nHis relationship with Epstein began in 2010, according to an investigation by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which cited the newly released files.\n\nIn an email to an unnamed contact in November of that year, Epstein wrote: “the President of Senegal is sending his son to see me in paris,” the publication noted. Over the years, they planned trips in Africa along with Emirati businessman, bin Sulayem. They also discussed business ideas, the files showed.\n\nIn 2015, after Wade was convicted on corruption charges by a new administration, records show Epstein approaching Norwegian leader of the Council of Europe, Thorborn Jagland, to ask about possibly filing an appeal at the European Court of Human Rights. Wade’s lawyers regularly updated Epstein on efforts to free him, according to OCCRP.\n\nSenegal pardoned Wade in 2016, after which he went into exile in Qatar. Keita, niece to Ivory Coast’s President Ouattara, who appeared to play some role in the efforts to free Wade, texted Epstein: “Thank you for everything you have done for him!!!!”\n\nRobert Mugabe\n\nThe Epstein documents revealed that the sex trafficker planned to meet then-President Mugabe to propose a new currency for Zimbabwe amid that country’s hyperinflation crisis.\n\nIn email exchanges back in 2015, Japanese financier Joi Ito recommended to Epstein that they both approach Mugabe to discuss the currency after the Zimbabwean dollar lost its value. It’s unclear if the meeting ever took place.\n\nReleased along with the emails were FBI documents from 2017, which appeared to show unverified testimony from a “confidential source” who said Epstein was a wealth manager for Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as Mugabe."

            "content": "A United Nations investigative body has warned that South Sudan risks “a return to full-scale war” unless it can urgently put an end to entrenched impunity and widespread abuses amid escalating violence in the world’s youngest country.\n\nThe report by the UN’s Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS), released on Friday at the Human Rights Council session in Geneva, found that civilians were enduring severe abuses including killings and “systematic” sexual violence, arbitrary detention, forced displacement and deprivation amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in one of the world’s most impoverished countries.\n\nIt said “escalating atrocity risks” and the collapse of political safeguards in the country made “urgent preventive action imperative”, calling on regional and international actors to engage with diplomatic pressure, sanctions and enforcing the UN arms embargo until concrete improvements in human rights and accountability are achieved.\n\n“Preventing further mass atrocity crimes, institutional collapse, and the destruction of South Sudan’s fragile transition requires urgent coordinated national, regional and international re-engagement,” the report said.\n\nThe report, drawing on a year of investigations and testimony, blamed the actions of political and military elites – in detaining opposition leaders, eroding power sharing and attempting to change the terms of a 2018 peace agreement – for placing a peace framework in the country under major strain and increasing instability.\n\n\n\nIt noted that the arrest and removal from office of First Vice President Riek Machar last year, and his prosecution for murder, treason and crimes against humanity, had undermined “the core power-sharing guarantees” of the peace agreement, and triggered “political uncertainty and armed clashes on a scale not witnessed” for a decade.\n\nMachar, an ethnic Nuer, was suspended last year as South Sudan’s number two after opposition Nuer White Army fighters overran a military garrison in the town of Nasir.\n\nCivil war broke out in South Sudan in 2013, two years after gaining independence from Sudan, when President Salva Kiir, a member of the Dinka ethnic group, the country’s largest, first dismissed Machar as vice president, accusing him of plotting a coup.\n\nThe report also noted that intensifying military operations had been marked by a “dangerous shift in tactics”, including air strikes on civilian-populated areas.\n\nIt said that the deployment of forces from neighbouring Uganda, a guarantor of the 2018 peace agreement, had “materially strengthened” government forces militarily and “raised credible concerns” of violations of a UN arms embargo.\n\nThe CHRSS report noted that joint aerial bombardments by the Ugandan and South Sudan armies had targeted civilian areas, “predominantly affecting [ethnic] Nuer communities in opposition-affiliated areas”.\n\nSexual violence ‘widespread, systematic’\n\nConflict-related sexual violence remained a “defining and persistent feature” of the crisis, the report found, with survivor testimonies over the past decade showing “widespread and systematic patterns of rape and other forms of sexual violence perpetrated by all armed forces and groups”.\n\nMost women and girls lived “at constant risk of sexual violence,” it said, adding that last year, the threat of such abuse had again “functioned as a strategic instrument of conflict deployed to terrorise civilian populations, drive displacement, and fracture social cohesion”.\n\nThe report said that impunity was entrenched, with senior commanders and political actors rarely held accountable for serious abuses perpetrated on their behalf.\n\nThe report also noted a sharp deterioration in civic space, with journalists, activists and opposition figures facing harassment, surveillance and arbitrary detention, undermining prospects for inclusive political participation and long-term stability.\n\nThe commission urged the government to immediately halt violations by its forces, release those arbitrarily detained and guarantee freedoms of expression, assembly and association.\n\n\n\nIt also called for the urgent establishment of long-delayed transitional justice mechanisms to investigate and prosecute war crimes committed since 2013.\n\nRenewed conflict\n\nAn estimated 400,000 people were killed in the five years of a war waged largely along ethnic lines, before calm was restored with a peace deal in 2018.\n\nBut escalating fighting in recent months has brought renewed fears of a return to civil war.\n\nBeginning in December, a coalition of opposition forces – some loyal to Machar, leader of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition (SPLM/IO) – seized a string of government outposts in Jonglei state, an opposition stronghold northeast of the capital, Juba that is the homeland of the Nuer ethnic group.\n\nFollowing the territorial losses, South Sudan’s army announced a major military operation against opposition forces in late January, ordering civilians and aid groups to leave areas of Jonglei state, a move that the International Crisis Group said showed the country had “returned to war”.\n\nMillions affected\n\nThe United Nations said earlier this month that an estimated 280,000 people have been displaced by the fighting and air attacks since late December, including more than 235,000 across Jonglei alone, while UNICEF warned last week that more than 450,000 children are at risk of acute malnutrition due to mass displacement and the halting of critical medical services in Jonglei.\n\nNearly 10 million people need life-saving humanitarian assistance across South Sudan, while humanitarian operations have been crippled by attacks and looting, with observers saying both sides in the conflict have prevented assistance from reaching areas where they believe civilians support their opponents.\n\nThe CHRSS report said that civilians had borne the “overwhelming human brunt” of the crisis as conflict, violence, displacement and sexual violence had intensified “an already-dire humanitarian situation”.\n\nLast year, it said, displacement had risen by nearly 40 percent to 3.2 million people, while declining international assistance was disproportionately affecting women and children."

            "content": "Win would provisionally take Barcelona four points ahead of Real Madrid, who host Getafe on Monday night.\n\nWho: Barcelona vs Villarreal\n\nWhat: La Liga\n\nWhere: Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain\n\nWhen: Saturday, February 28 at 4:15pm (15:15 GMT)\n\nHow to follow: We’ll have all the build-up on Al Jazeera Sport from 12:30 GMT in advance of our live text commentary stream.\n\nBarca welcome high-flying Villarreal to Camp Nou, with the hosts looking to tighten their grip on pole position in La Liga.\n\nA win would provisionally take Barcelona four points ahead of second-placed Real Madrid, who host mid-table Getafe on Monday night.\n\nBarcelona had a mini-wobble earlier this month as they were thrashed 4-0 by Atletico Madrid in the first-leg of their Copa del Rey semifinal before losing 2-1 to Girona, allowing Madrid to briefly occupy top spot.\n\nHowever, Barca bounced back with a 3-0 win over Levante last weekend to steady the ship, while Madrid slipped to a surprise defeat at Osasuna.\n\nThird-placed Villarreal trail Barcelona by 10 points, and their hopes of competing for the title could be rekindled with a surprise victory at Camp Nou.\n\nThe visitors come into the game high on confidence after beating Valencia 2-1 in their last outing and winning three of their last four La Liga matches.\n\nVillarreal have also won their last two away games against Barcelona, so they will have little fear heading into this showdown.\n\nBarca strikers firing blanks as Villarreal visit\n\nBarcelona host Villarreal amid concerns about the form of strikers Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres.\n\nFormer Bayern Munich great Lewandowski, 37, has declined rapidly this season as well as enduring some fitness issues, while Torres, 25, is on course for a personal record for goals, but most of them came in a purple patch towards the end of last year.\n\n\n\nThe Catalan giants have obvious problems in defence, as opponents exploit their high line with growing regularity, but last season managed to score enough goals to outweigh their deficiencies in that area as they lifted a domestic treble.\n\nBarca still lead La Liga for goals scored this season, with 67, but they are coming from everywhere – 10 different players have scored two or more, and nobody has more than Torres on 12.\n\nBut Torres has just three goals in his last 15 appearances across all competitions, and his all-round game is lacking, unable to contribute effectively as Barca build up attacks, frequently losing the ball.\n\nLewandowski has five goals in his last 18 games, but seems less mobile than before and a peripheral presence at times.\n\n“With so many matches rotation at striker is natural, and I think Ferran and I can benefit from the current situation,” Lewandowski told Polish magazine Pilka Nozna this week.\n\n“When you play 90 minutes every three days, your whole life is about recovery, now the balance is a little better. I’m tired but I’m not worn out.”\n\nFlick considers deploying Rashford as a striker\n\nBarcelona coach Hansi Flick has not used England international Marcus Rashford much in that position, with the Manchester United loanee more keen on operating from the left.\n\nHowever, with Raphinha fit and firing after an injury absence, Rashford might now view playing as a number nine as his best chance of more minutes.\n\nRashford has been effective for Barca this season, albeit as much in providing assists rather than scoring, laying on 13 goals for his teammates while netting 10 himself in 34 games across all competitions.\n\nWhile other sides took part in the Champions League playoff round, Flick hopes a relatively quiet couple of weeks for his side will have been of huge benefit.\n\n“It’s important that we [had] these two weeks to rest a little bit but also focus on the next match against Villarreal; that will also be a tough match,” said Flick.\n\n“After that, hopefully every three or four days we have a match, so it’s important to have these two weeks.”\n\n‘They’re a brave team that leaves spaces’\n\nVillarreal defender Santiago Mourino said his side were coming to Camp Nou for all three points and highlighted Barcelona’s high line as a weakness they would look to exploit.\n\n“We want to beat Barcelona and close the gap on them. It’s a difficult game. They’ve won all their home games,” Mourino said in a pre-match news conference.\n\n\n\n“Let’s see if we can end their winning streak. We have to play as equals.”\n\nHe added: “They’re a brave team that leaves spaces and we have to take advantage of those chances. We have great strikers and we need to be clinical to win.\n\n“We are one of the best teams in La Liga in open play and on the counterattack. If we are accurate, we can do well.”\n\nHead-to-head\n\nBarcelona and Villarreal have locked horns on 57 occasions. Barcelona won 35 of those games, Villarreal won 12, and 10 matches ended as draws.\n\nVillarreal have won their last two games away at Barca by scoring plenty of goals – recording a 3-2 victory in May 2025 and a 5-3 win in January 2024.\n\nWhat happened the last time these clubs met?\n\nBarcelona wingers Raphinha and Lamine Yamal guided the Catalan giants to a 2-0 win away at 10-man Villarreal in December 2025.\n\nBrazilian international Raphinha won and converted an early penalty before Villarreal’s Renato Veiga was sent off before half-time for a late lunge on Yamal.\n\nLamal slotted home Barca’s second midway through the second half.\n\nBarcelona team news\n\nBarca announced on Thursday that midfielder Frenkie de Jong will be out for up to six weeks with a hamstring issue. Centre-back Andreas Christensen has also been ruled out for a lengthy period with a similar injury.\n\nDefender Gerard Martin will be suspended for accumulating too many yellow cards.\n\nIn some positive news for Barca, midfielder Gavi has resumed training following a serious knee injury that has kept him out of action since August, but he is not expected to feature until sometime in March.\n\nPredicted starting XI:\n\nJoan Garcia (goalkeeper); Kounde, Cubarsi, Eric Garcia, Balde; Bernal, Pedri; Yamal, Fermin, Raphinha; Lewandowski\n\nVillarreal’s team news\n\nPau Cabanes, Logan Costa, Juan Foyth, Willy Kambwala have all been ruled out with injuries, while Gerard Moreno and Pape Gueye face late fitness tests.\n\nPossible starting XI:\n\nLuiz Junior (goalkeeper); Mourino, Navarro, Veiga, Pedraza; Pepe, Comesana, Gueye, Moleiro; Mikautadze, Perez"

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nUltrahuman is expanding its health monitoring ecosystem with the launch of a new flagship smart ring and a “biointelligence AI” platform upgrade. The Ring Pro is Ultrahuman’s third-generation smart ring, and promises up to 15 days of battery life before needing to recharge, alongside 250 days of on-device health history storage.\n\nThose are some significant improvements compared to its predecessor, the 2023 Ring Air, which provides 4-6 days of battery life and several days of offline data storage, according to user estimates. Ultrahuman has also made other upgrades to the Ring Pro, including a redesigned heart-rate sensor that improves signal during sleep and recovery, a faster dual-core processor, and safety improvements that allow the ring to be cut off fingers more easily in an emergency.\n\nThe Ultrahuman Ring Pro will ship with a new Pro Charging case that provides an additional 45 days of battery life and stores up to one year of ring data. The case features an integrated speaker and proximity tracker that allow users to find the device via the Ultrahuman app, wireless charging, and an LED indicator that displays battery level status.\n\nThe Ring Pro Charging Case includes a light bar that indicates how much battery life it has remaining. Image: Ultrahuman\n\nThe Ring Pro comes in gold, silver, black, and titanium color options, and is available in sizes 5-14. Preorders are launching today for $479 with global availability — except in the United States, where Ultrahuman is clashing with patents from rival smart ring provider Oura. Shipments start in March.\n\nThe rollout of Jade, Ultrahuman’s new AI platform upgrade, doesn’t exclude the US, and will be available to all global Ultrahuman users. Ultrahuman says that Jade is “the world’s first real-time biointelligence AI,” capable of pulling health data insights and actioning breathwork and atrial fibrillation (AFib) detection tasks. Future updates will allow Jade to do “much more,” according to Ultrahuman, including proactively flagging health concerns before they occur, controlling smart home functions like adjusting room temperature, and even ordering food.\n\nThe Jade AI-platform upgrade will be available to all Ultrahuman users globally. Image: Ultrahuman\n\nUltrahuman says the goal is to have Jade serve as an “autonomous health agent working 24x7 to improve your life,“ but it hasn’t specified when these additional features will be available."

Use the close button or Escape to return to the comic.\n\nIf you want to get a letter out of a Burmese prison, do not give it to the guards.\n\nPerhaps this is obvious, but when they told me I could write two a month — one to my embassy and one to Juliana — I was naive enough to try.\n\n\"All night,\" I wrote to Juliana.\n\n“A fluorescent flood light illuminates the clouds of mosquitoes feasting on me, which makes it hard to sleep, and when the mosquitoes retreat, the ants crawl in — in pulsing veins along the cell wall and floor, over every inch of skin all day.”\n\nI filled every centimeter of the official letter form they gave me.\n\n“But it’s all fine. I’ve already gotten used to it by now. I just want to see you.”\n\nThree days later…\n\n“Write bigger. And don’t say there are ants here.”\n\nSo I tried again.\n\n“Ju- I love and miss you so much. I am doing well physically and feeling more or less healthy — but mentally things are obviously rough…”\n\n“No.”\n\nAnd again.\n\n“Sorry.”\n\nI first landed in Myanmar in early May 2019, just in time for World Press Freedom Day.\n\nA decade earlier the country's military leaders had begun a partial democratization process that notably included the end of pre-publication press censorship.\n\nAfter elections in 2015, in which the military government had been trounced by the now-fallen democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi, they'd began handing over chunks of government to her quasi-civilian administration.\n\nThough representative, Suu Kyi's administration proved nearly as intolerant of its critics as the military had been, even if it still maintained wide public support.\n\nWhen I arrived, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo had been sitting in the city's Insein Prison for two years.\n\nThe year they were arrested, in 2017, I was earning $12 an hour reporting for a rural Louisiana newspaper…\n\n...while our newly elected president channeled fury toward press pools at the back of his convention halls.\n\nAmerican journalism was facing its gravest threats, pundits were saying, and it wasn't even paying a living wage.\n\nI came to Myanmar because, if our worst fears were coming to pass, I thought its journalists might have something to teach me.\n\nIf I had come to Myanmar looking for lessons, Juliana had come hoping to simply grin and bear a consular posting that was not her first choice.\n\nWe met on the apps.\n\n“Hi Peidão*” (*person who farts a lot)\n\nOn our first date, over a shared bottle of beer, we lamented the rise of a global far right, and pined for the lost optimism of our youth.\n\nShe quoted Gramsci and Marx, and I pretended to have read them. I rushed the bill as soon as the beer finished, nervous about showing my ignorance.\n\nOn our next date, we both confessed we'd wanted to order another bottle that night.\n\nJuliana lived alone in an airy, three-bedroom apartment paid for by her country's foreign service.\n\nI lived downtown with a 6’3\" Brit who taught English three days a week and spent the other four ranking his all-time favorite black metal albums in YouTube videos.\n\nWe stayed mostly at hers.\n\nDespite the deteriorating press situation, it seemed like a time of great hope.\n\nOn May 6th, 2019, after 511 days in the country's infamous Insein Prison, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were released.\n\n“I can't wait to go to my newsroom now. I am a journalist. I am going to continue.”\n\nAnd in 2020, nationwide elections were deemed fair and credible by foreign and domestic observers.\n\nIt felt like a tide was shifting, in Myanmar and the US.\n\nJuliana's lease was coming to an end, and despite the pool and the sleek appliances at her compound, the thrill of downtown still pulled at me.\n\nWe found a secret palace hidden amid the shambles of the historic Muslim quarter...\n\n...where sunsets poured bronze light through the kitchen window and the muezzin call would metronome our days.\n\nWe were giddy...\n\n...and in love.\n\n“Baby there’s room in here… just enough for two in here. Baby there’s…”\n\nBreaking News: Myanmar leader is detained amid coup. Military declares state of emergency.\"\n\nOn February 1st, we were inundated with links. The coup had been unintentionally livestreamed and went viral.\n\n“Have you seen this?” “Wait… what?”\n\n“She was just filming a workout video.” “STOP.” “And there’s THE COUP right behind her!”\n\nTogether we watched the dozens of videos — from all corners of the internet — superimposing the infamous Myanmar Coup Dancer over history.\n\nAfter the coup, at precisely 8pm each night, seemingly everyone in Yangon stepped outside and slammed together pots or pans — any blunt objects close at hand — an ancient means of warding off evil, now a sign of resistance to military rule.\n\nThe protests were joyful at first.\n\nSigns: “My ex is bad but Myanmar military is worse.” “Ah shit here we go again.”\n\nUntil…\n\n\"Weeks of relatively peaceful protests turned deadly on Feb. 20th when two unarmed protesters were killed by security forces in the city of…”\n\nThe military began raiding newsrooms.\n\nIncluding my former employer, the investigative news site Myanmar Now, among the country's most staunchly anti-militarist outlets.\n\nOur Western friends were leaving.\n\n“Can we help Lorcan give away his books?”\n\nWe considered doing the same.\n\n“We can fly to Detroit, stay with my parents for a bit, and then road trip out to California.” “I get to meet the family Peidões?”\n\nOne night in April, just after 8pm.\n\nAn eerie hush settled over our street.\n\n“Danny! Get back!”\n\nA soldier's flashlight flooded our apartment.\n\nI booked a ticket to Detroit.\n\nText to Consular Official: “Hi, my name is Danny Fenster. I'm an American journalist working for Frontier Myanmar. I'm sure I don't have anything to worry about, but I did use to work at Myanmar Now, and I'm going to be flying out of Yangon on May 24th. I just wanted to let you know in case there was any cause for concern.”\n\n“Hi Danny, thanks for letting us know. We don't have any indication that there's reason to worry, You've given them ten days' notice so you should be fine.”\n\nText to Juliana from the airport: “lol these covid outfits got a pic w the ipad will send later can’t send pics with the burner phone”\n\nTexts from Juliana: “can’t wait to see it miss you”\n\n“Ahem… Could DANIEL JACOB FENSTER please report to the…”\n\n“Daniel Jacob? We have a few questions for you, related to…\n\n…an ongoing criminal investigation.”\n\nText to Juliana: “babe not joking call the embassy.”\n\nPEN America Demands Myanmar Release US Journalist Danny Fenster “Managing editor of one of the few independent news outlets was detained while attempting to board a flight out of the country Some 4,000 other people have been detained by the authorities in recent months…”\n\nThe Washington Post Democracy Dies in Darkness Asia & Pacific “American journalist is detained by Myanmar regime while trying to leave country Fenster, 37, is the fourth foreign journalist detained in Myanmar since the military seized power in a coup in February. The military government routinely publishes lists of \"wanted\" journalists, accusing them of affecting \"state stability,\" and has detained more than 70 journalists in total, according to media watchdogs.”\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists “Myanmar arrests US editor Danny Fenster at Yangon airport Myanmar authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Frontier Myanmar managing editor Danny Fenster and allow him to travel freely outside the” [text is cut off]\n\nThe Guardian “US journalist detained in Myanmar while boarding flight home Family of Danny Fenster voice concern for his welfare after he was held by authorities in Yangon international airport”\n\nThey’d taken my electronics and my books.\n\n“Noon. Quiet Hour.” <click, lock>\n\nYet somehow, they'd missed the sepia notebook I'd been keeping since January.\n\nThe hardest thing in those initial days was the boredom. I had no news of the outside world to distract me. Nothing to fix my attention on.\n\nSo l scribbled to myself.\n\n“FRIDAY, 1pm Afternoons are the worst. Right now it's 1pm and I'm locked in my cell for ‘nap time.’ Every day from noon to 1:30pm it's quiet hour. We have to go lie down in bed and be quiet, which is actually quite fine by me. I try not to sleep so l'll be more tired at night. It's hard enough to fall asleep: they make us sleep with the light on, on top of a wooden pallet with a couple of blankets for padding. And then there are the mosquitoes biting and the ants…”\n\nI noted the endless rain…\n\n“Sheets of rain pouring down outside these bars, out into the yard, the pool that was a garden yesterday — filling the stone basin and my drinking water jar”\n\n…and my insect companions,\n\n“Drifting always to the corner, its legs splayed akimbo, forming an X with its limp antennae, legs dangling, at ease, any tensions having fled, it looks like underneath, on its insect face, it must be smiling at its oblivion, although of course it may have died in a drowning suffocating panic, but now it's free.”\n\n…my small victories,\n\n“‘Tidied' after interrogations today. Dirty laundry bag, hung shirts, turned clean clothes into a sweatpant-leg pillow.”\n\n…and my mounting dread.\n\n“2 sachets of coffee left, no toothpaste. Gotta wash some clothes soon.”\n\nAnd then one day…\n\nJuliana's package was my first indication that anyone knew where I was. It had taken several days to pass inspection.\n\nI'd heard there were books too, but the prison translator had to first certify that they contained no political content.\n\nJournal entry: “Just reflecting on how brilliant my wife is. She near telepathically included just about every essential item I’d been wanting. And she included a (new?) air-tight tupperware container, to keep the bugs out. Most of this she must have intuited. I also imagine her asking coworkers etc., ‘What to pack into a prisoners parcel.’”\n\nThe days passed…\n\npunctuated by the same routines,\n\nand occasional gifts.\n\n(And then one day:)\n\nLetter from Juliana: “Yangon, June 2nd, 2021. Danny, babe. You have no idea how much I miss you. I want you to know that everything is fine. Rose and Bud are well and healthy. Bryan is being a true warrior and is doing everything he can from the States. I am also doing the best I can in here. I spent the last nights alone at our apartment, looking around. It hasn't been long that we have moved in, but I feel like we have lived here for years. I LOVE this place. I love the beams on the ceiling, the open kitchen. I absolutely love the office — I have sat there a few times to talk to your family, with the fan on my face, and I understand why you like that spot so much. There was a power cut the other day — 4 hours in the heat — I think this is one of those things about living the full Myanmar experience. I saw a gecko two nights ago in our bedroom. I am 99% sure there is a rat in the kitchen (I know I have said that before, but now the noise is more constant. I have to record it for you). I am also observing the pigeons for you. I think there are less birds on our windowsill though — they might've heard that you were travelling on holidays. I don't go to the balcony in the mornings so often anymore, but I always go there in the afternoon. I have this image of you coming back home in the beginning of the evenings, so I go there every now and then and wait. I see the men going to the mosque for the afternoon prayers, the sandals — dozens of them! — aligned by the entrance. Everything and everyone so alive. Life passing busy as usual while we wait for good news, while I wait for you. Every single thing at this apartment reminds me of you, of this chapter of our lives. I love you so much. Please promise me that you'll be strong. I'm trying my best on my side, and I'm doing alright, I promise. A tiny bit of craziness, but I think it will add to my charm. Love you, peidão! I love you more. Ju.” After the guards rejected my third attempt at official correspondence with Juliana, rumor spread of a pending deal: two members of an armed ethnic insurgency in my ward would soon be released.\n\nI abandoned my written detente with the prison censors and scribbled out a long rambling note to Juliana.\n\n“Also what's going on in int'l news? In the US? Any big stories?\n\nP.S. plz send me some pictures of you! Things: fucking cashews! P.S. — Some additional books, if you can find them! \"What Is History\" and \"Homo Deus.\" The first is at Dom's & the second is either also at Dom's or at your place. Also, \"This Thing of Darkness,\" or something like that, is a book Lorcan gave me before he left. I think it's in that suitcase he gave me. These would be good ones. Do you think the US embassy has \"Grapes of Wrath\"? Being able to listen to podcasts and my own music would make all of this infinitely more bareable too — podcasts especially. Alas, I'm pretty sure headphones & electronics are banned. [frowny face] I love you so much. See you soon. Xoxo, Danny” The insurgent spoke no English. I willed him to understand me.\n\n“Please, take this to my wife.”\n\nIt felt like casting a bottled letter into the ocean.\n\n—\n\nIt wasn't long before the guards found my notebooks. Paper and ink were declared contraband in my ward.\n\n<click, lock>\n\nIf I couldn't record the experience, what did any of it matter?\n\nI was being forced — possibly for the first time since the advent of the iPhone — to sit, for hour after unending hour, from one interminable minute to another, with nothing to occupy my mind.\n\nof all the terror and discomfort l endured in prison, it was this —\n\nboredom\n\n— that nearly broke me.\n\nThere was a TV in our ward, but programming was limited, and all of it in Burmese anyway.\n\nA Buddhist monk, one of the only English speakers there, told me they used to watch BBC and Discovery Channel. But on the morning of the coup, the TV signal was cut completely.\n\nWhen it came back on, only state broadcasts remained.\n\n“That's how we knew the military had taken back control.”\n\nOne day, I noticed a prisoner fiddling with something.\n\nThe monk explained that for just a few thousand kyat or a handful of betel nuts, guards brought prisoners USB sticks full of Chinese action movies and Bollywood musicals, or TikTok reels of people being kicked in the nuts. Some even had small MP3 players they listened to illegal music on.\n\nl began scheming immediately.\n\nWhen I'd packed for Detroit, I'd left on my desk a Zoom H1n recorder with a microSD card inside.\n\nI scavenged the prison ward for paper, and, using a contraband pen, I wrote a note to Juliana describing the recorder's exact location. I made lists of all the podcasts I wanted to hear.\n\nWhen another detainee was paroled, I forced the notes on him with another map of the city.\n\nAnd then I waited.\n\n…\n\n“Monk?”\n\n“Sit.\n\nFocus your attention on the tip of your nose….\n\n…the sensation going in and out of your nostrils.”\n\nFor fifteen minutes, the monk watched me struggle.\n\nIt felt impossible.\n\n“Do this upon waking each morning, and for five minutes at the start of each hour, at least for the first few hours of the day…\n\nThen, when this becomes easy, up these hourly intervals to ten minutes, then fifteen.”\n\nSlowly…\n\n…a tolerance for boredom pervaded my waking moments.\n\nI could watch my thoughts\n\nmove\n\nfrom one to the next.\n\nI thought about the circumstances that had brought me to Myanmar. I'd wanted to learn from journalists standing up to unimaginable repression.\n\nBut I was also questioning the point of journalism altogether. Our problems did not stem from a scarcity of reliable reporting or facts.\n\nMoving abroad was my last-ditch effort to salvage some meaning from the work, so l might stay at it.\n\nBut when I arrived, I mostly felt overwhelmed by Myanmar's politics, home to more than 20 ethnic armies and several times as many militias even before the coup, each plagued by their own internecine power struggles. I’d felt inexpert and ill-placed.\n\nWho was to be telling the story of this place?\n\nSo l'd fallen into the role of editor, helping local writers and reporters tell their own stories to the English-speaking world.\n\nBut on my worst days, I still wondered if any of it mattered.\n\nMeanwhile..\n\nPost: “@amykurzweil\n\nOn Monday 5/24, my cousin Danny Fenster was imprisoned by the military in Myanmar for the \"crime\" of being a journalist.

He was remanded once again to the prison, and there are still no official charges.”\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Buddy Fenster and 2 others Day 92. Another hearing has come and gone, and again we wait. Danny remains in prison..”\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Ethan Kurzweil and 4 others. Day 100. Today we hit a painful milestone, it marks the 100th day since my little brother, Danny Fenster, was wrongly detained in Myanmar, apparently, simply for being a journalist.

He looks dismayed, and then peers inside the empty box to discover a small microSD card taped inside.]\n\nIt took several days of begging and bribing before another prisoner was able to help me set the terms of an hourly lease on an MP3 player from one of the other detainees.\n\nI walked as casually as I could back to my cell.\n\n<slide> [Danny inserts the microSD card into the MP3 player and turns up the volume.] <click> <tap tap tap>\n\n“Baby there’s room in here… Just enough for two in here…”\n\nIt was Juliana’s voice.\n\n“Ain’t nobody but you and me in here…”\n\nI replayed it again. And again.\n\n“...yea, what can we do in here…”\n\n“I love you babe. I miss you so so so much.”\n\nDrawing on paper: “I had no luck with the pictures so I will try again with Amy’s drawing. I love you babe. So so much. Stay strong, for me, for us! LOVE YOU, Ju”\n\nSomehow, Juliana had also downloaded the entire thirty-year archive of my favorite podcast and stuffed it all on that mircoSD card. As soon as I stopped replaying her singing, I heard another familiar voice...\n\n“From WBEZ Chicago… It’s THIS AMERICAN LIFE. I’m Ira Glass… stay with us…”\n\nFor whatever reason (which Juliana would later claim was not intentional), the first episode to play was from 2011, Episode 448: \"Adventure!”\n\nIn Act One, an expat Minnesotan named \"Luke\" gets pulled into a minor street brawl in Shenzhen, China, then flees. A few days later the police come asking questions, and then they lock him up.\n\n“It was, like, a Tuesday I think. I went in, and they're like, ‘We'll be back on Friday to let you know what's going on.’ And honestly, at that time I thought I was going to be released on Friday…\n\n“... I was thinking, OK, three nights, four nights, this is no problem. I'm kind of an adventurous soul. At this point, I'm still fairly calm. Like, well, I'm in a Chinese jail, this is crazy, but what a story.”\n\n“And in the end, how long did you end up staying in this detention center?”\n\n“Eight months…\n\nEight months.”\n\n“The cell was a rectangle, 10 by 15 feet… During storms, you couldn't hide from the rain blowing in, so everyone would get drenched… …up at 7, then breakfast… …thin rice water broth… … nap from 11:30 to 1:30… …The days became all the same — boredom punctuated by the occasional spasm of extreme emotion.” “In classic adventure stories, like The Odyssey, there isn't much fun. There's pain, fear, and death, and occasionally, if you're lucky… …small transformations.”\n\nOn a Friday afternoon that November, in a military court within the prison compound, I was found guilty of a slew of arcane crimes, including causing offense to the military, and sentenced to eleven years with hard labor.\n\nI was marched to the prison office, stripped of my street clothes and dressed in prison blues.\n\nBy the time I made it back to my cell, the others had been locked in for the night. I spent that evening desolate and crying, trying to comprehend the weight of eleven years.\n\nThat proved impossible, and so by the morning I'd convinced myself that, actually, I had to be convicted in order to be pardoned.\n\n“Why else would they give you a Covid test?”\n\nSure enough, on Monday morning, I was awoken earlier than everyone else.\n\n<unlock> “Pack up.”\n\nI never got to say goodbye.\n\nBy that evening, Burmese police were handing me over to a scrum of men, including the late Bill Richardson, former New Mexico governor, who'd made a second career negotiating the release of Americans detained abroad. They said they had a chartered jet taxing outside for me.\n\nIt had been six months.\n\nForeigners not deported directly from prison had to book tickets ten days before their departure so the government could monitor comings and goings.\n\nDanny on phone: “Hey babe... Oh, nothing much… What's new with you?”\n\nNovember 15th, 2021: Juliana booked her ticket that night.\n\nI thought I'd gone to Myanmar to learn how to defeat dictators, but Burmese journalists knew all along that such defeats are never final.\n\n“The New York Times U.S. Journalist Danny Fenster Is Freed From Myanmar Prison The release was a rare positive development in the country, which has been torn by violence since a February coup.”\n\n“The Detroit Jewish News Home Free: After Six Months in a Myanmar Prison, Journalist is with His Family in Huntington Woods”\n\n“Deadline Detroit With Hugs And A Haircut, Danny Fenster Readjusts In A Familiar Home Near Detroit - His Family's”\n\n“MICHIGAN Fenster after being freed from Myanmar: ‘I'm really happy to be on my way home' Detroit News staff and wire reports”\n\n“BBC Danny Fenster: US journalist freed from Myanmar jail”\n\nThe lesson is to keep reporting anyway..\n\n“Bryan Fenster is with Amy Kurzweil and 4 others.

I'm going to spin class.” “OK.” “And the Rubins are downstairs – they want to say hi. The Detroit Jewish News will stop by at 4. They just want a picture, then they'll leave us alone.” “OK, Ma—” “What time does she land?” “Soon.”\n\nBecause to suffer sucks, so you simply tell…\n\n“Danny!” “I can’t believe you’re home!” “You lost the man bun!” “You made it!” “We’re so happy you’re here.” “Mmmmwah! So handsome!” “Phew!”\n\n“Hey Dan… Dad’s waiting for ya in the car.”\n\nAnd sometimes, if you’re lucky…\n\n…you, find, in the telling…\n\n…that suffering transformed.\n\n[Danny and Juliana are reunited at the airport, embracing.]"

            "content": "With rare exceptions, phones are pretty boring these days. The good news is, a boatload of those rare exceptions are about to show up at once, courtesy of Mobile World Congress.\n\nThe tech industry’s biggest mobile show may not quite have the clout it once did, when the likes of Samsung, Sony, LG, and HTC showcased new flagships there each year, but it still attracts more phone launches than CES does two months earlier. It’s especially popular with the Chinese manufacturers who are still fighting for space in the global market, along with niche manufacturers who turn up with extra-durable “rugged” devices, or battery beasts that are more power bank than phone.\n\nThis year’s biggest event is expected to be Xiaomi’s launch on Saturday. Ever eclectic, it’s teased tablets, super-slim power banks, earbuds, and smart trackers among its MWC lineup, but all eyes will be on the Leitzphone. This collaboration between Xiaomi and Leica takes the former’s Xiaomi 17 Ultra — follow-up to one of the absolute best cameras in any phone last year — and slaps a rotating camera ring on the back, allowing you to physically scroll through the continuous optical zoom the phone’s telephoto provides. It’s a double whammy of novel camera hardware that may sit right on the edge of “gimmick” territory, but is at least a variation from the same old stuff.\n\nXiaomi should reveal an updated global version of its collaboration with Leica. Image: Xiaomi\n\nHonor will be up next, with its event set for Sunday. The company has already revealed the MagicPad 4 — apparently the thinnest fully fledged tablet around — and teased its next-generation foldable phone, also expected to be the world’s thinnest. But much more exciting than either is what the company promises will be a proper look at its so-called Robot Phone, first teased late last year in a concept video and shown in static prototype form at CES last month.\n\nFrom what we’ve seen, it’s certainly more phone than robot, but the gimbal-stabilized camera arm that unfolds out of the phone’s back is undeniably novel. It’s like a cross between a smartphone and a DJI Osmo Pocket, with teasers hinting at AI features and a cheery, WALL-E-esque sense of character. With Honor also teasing the reveal of its first foray into full humanoid robotics, expect it to lean hard on its robot credentials.\n\nI have my doubts about how realistic Tecno’s magnetic modular concept phone is, but it does look pretty slick. Image: Tecno\n\nAnd those are just the big two. Expect to see more from Nothing, which is launching its Phone 4A series and a new pair of over-ear headphones at its own event on March 5th, but is almost certain to tease more details on both over the next few days. Tecno has promised a modular, magnetic concept smartphone with attachable lenses and action camera; Vivo has announced some sort of reveal of its camera-centric X300 Ultra flagship; and Lenovo, which simply loves to bring a weird and wacky concept device to the show, is teasing its own announcements.\n\nWill anything be as silly as last year’s Realme concept, which strapped a DSLR telephoto onto the back of a smartphone? Image: Dominic Preston / The Verge\n\nWhen you’re competing with Apple for attention, playing it safe won’t get you very far\n\nAnd you can’t blame them, not least when Apple has waded in to promise its own week of announcements starting… Monday, the same day that MWC officially kicks off. In true Apple fashion, we don’t know for sure what’s coming, but affordable MacBooks and the midrange iPhone 17E have both been heavily tipped. When you’re competing with Apple for attention, playing it safe won’t get you very far.\n\nI’m at least half a cynic when it comes to these outlandish hardware announcements. The ones that you can actually buy are often little more than gimmicks, and the ones you can’t usually feel like no more than marketing stunts. But in the past 10 days, we’ve had the Pixel 10A and Galaxy S26 in quick succession, both minimal upgrades that lean on fractional spec bumps and AI additions to justify their existence. I wouldn’t hold my breath for next week’s iPhone 17E to revolutionize much either. As Allison Johnson put it in her S26 Ultra preview this week, “hardware thrills are hard to get these days.” MWC has them in spades."

Since it’s a global show, that includes all manner of announcements of phones, tablets, and wearables that won’t necessarily release in the US.\n\nXiaomi has already teased a European launch for its 17 and 17 Ultra flagships, Honor is promising not only its Robot Phone but a full pivot to humanoid robotics, and Nothing is almost certain to drop more details on its Phone 4A ahead of a planned London launch on March 5th.\n\nThe likes of Samsung and Google will be there too, but mostly to talk about the already-announced 10A and S26 models, while Apple is launching something during the same week as MWC, but not actually in Barcelona.\n\nWe’ll also be looking out for oddities.

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.\n\nLess than 24 hours before the deadline in an ultimatum issued by the Pentagon, Anthropic has refused the Department of Defense’s demands for unrestricted access to its AI.\n\nIt’s the culmination of a dramatic exchange of public statements, social media posts, and behind-the-scenes negotiations, coming down to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s desire to renegotiate all AI labs’ current contracts with the military. But Anthropic, so far, has refused to back down from its two current red lines: no mass surveillance of Americans, and no lethal autonomous weapons (or weapons with license to kill targets with no human oversight whatsoever). OpenAI and xAI had reportedly already agreed to the new terms, while Anthropic’s refusal had led to CEO Dario Amodei being summoned to the White House this week for a meeting with Hegseth himself, in which the Secretary reportedly issued an ultimatum to the CEO to back down by the end of business day on Friday or else.\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Amodei wrote, “I believe deeply in the existential importance of using AI to defend the United States and other democracies, and to defeat our autocratic adversaries. Anthropic has therefore worked proactively to deploy our models to the Department of War and the intelligence community.”\n\nHe added that the company has “never raised objections to particular military operations nor attempted to limit use of our technology in an ad hoc manner” but that in a “narrow set of cases, we believe AI can undermine, rather than defend, democratic values” — going on to specifically mention mass domestic surveillance and fully autonomous weapons. (Amodei mentioned that “partial autonomous weapons … are vital to the defense of democracy” and that fully autonomous weapons may eventually “prove critical for our national defense,” but that “today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons.” He did not rule out Anthropic acquiescing to the military’s use of fully autonomous weapons in the future but mentioned that they were not ready now.)\n\nThe Pentagon had already reportedly asked major defense contractors to assess their dependence on Anthropic’s Claude, which could be seen as the first step to designating the company a “supply chain risk” — a public threat that the Pentagon had made recently (and a classification usually reserved for threats to national security). The Pentagon was also reportedly considering invoking the Defense Production Act to make Anthropic comply.\n\nAmodei wrote in his statement that the Pentagon’s “threats do not change our position: we cannot in good conscience accede to their request.” He also wrote that “should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.”"

Gross profit continues to grow, we continue to serve more and more customers, and profitability is improving. But something has changed. We’re already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that’s accelerating rapidly.”\n\nDorsey opted to do a big layoff instead of gradual cuts because “I’d rather take a hard, clear action now and build from a position we believe in than manage a slow reduction of people toward the same outcome.”\n\nThe layoffs were announced on Thursday as part of the company’s Q4 2025 earnings.

It will be available for pre-orders globally, excluding the U.S., with shipments beginning in March.\n\nUltrahuman’s U.S. business was disrupted in October 2025 after the U.S. International Trade Commission — a federal agency that handles trade disputes — ruled in Oura’s favor in a patent dispute. The ruling prevented the startup from importing new ring inventory into the country, although existing retail stock continued to be sold. The blow was significant. The U.S. accounted for about 45% of Ultrahuman’s roughly 700,000 daily active users worldwide, according to co-founder and CEO Mohit Kumar.\n\nIn August 2025, Ultrahuman also filed a separate patent infringement case against Oura in the Delhi High Court, where the matter remains pending.\n\nMeanwhile, to work around Oura’s patent, Ultrahuman developed the Ring Pro with a new design, Kumar told TechCrunch, adding that the device has been submitted to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for clearance.

It reported $64 million in operating revenue in the financial year ended March 2025. The startup remains profitable after tax, although margins are expected to narrow due to litigation costs, tariffs, and the redesign effort, he added.\n\nAlongside the new ring, Ultrahuman introduced Jade, a real-time “biointelligence” system that analyzes user health data across its devices and services to generate personalized insights and recommendations.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

The device can store up to 250 days of health data and weighs about 5% to 6% more than the Ring Air, launched in July 2023 at $349.\n\nUltrahuman has also introduced a Pro Charger with up to 45 days of battery life to support on-the-go charging and enable faster updates and diagnostics through direct case connectivity. The charger also supports wireless charging via Qi, the same standard used by most modern smartphones.\n\nUltrahuman’s Pro Charger Image Credits:Ultrahuman\n\nWomen account for about 68% of Ultrahuman’s user base, up from roughly 65% a year earlier, Kumar said, reflecting strong adoption of the startup’s women’s health features.\n\nUltrahuman also offers subscription-based services across its broader health platform, including a coaching and recovery program called PowerPlugs, the Blood Vision metabolic panel, Ultrahuman Home, and a continuous glucose monitoring offering. Subscriptions contribute about 16% of Ultrahuman’s revenue, while Blood Vision accounts for roughly 5% to 6% of the business, Kumar said.\n\nUltrahuman’s key growth markets include the UK, Canada, Australia, and India, Kumar told TechCrunch, with the latter contributing about 8% to 9% of overall revenue after recent investments in local customer support.\n\nGlobal smart ring shipments grew nearly 80% year-over-year in 2025, driven by demand for compact wearables with advanced sleep tracking and longer battery life, said Anshika Jain, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research. Oura continues to lead with more than two-thirds of the market, while Ultrahuman holds the second position.\n\nJain added that future leaders in the category will be defined by sensor accuracy, AI-driven insights, and seamless ecosystem integration.\n\nSeparate IDC data showed global smart ring shipments rising about 30% year over year in Q3 2025 to nearly 1 million units, driven in part by demand for screenless fitness trackers, said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president at IDC India. Ultrahuman captured roughly 25% of the market during the period, per IDC.\n\nFounded in 2019, Ultrahuman has raised about $55 million to date and counts Alpha Wave Incubation, Blume Ventures, Steadview Capital, and Nexus Venture Partners among its investors.\n\nUltrahuman, Kumar said, is building additional production capacity to support demand for the Ring Pro over the coming months."

Recent examples include Stripe, which this week said it would allow employees to sell shares at a $159 billion valuation, as well as Clay, ElevenLabs, and Linear.\n\nBeyond retention and to help staff cover tax bills triggered when RSUs vest, they relieve pressure on management to pursue an IPO before the company is ready."

Discovery.\n\nOn Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount Skydance’s newest offer of $31 a share was a “superior proposal,” giving Netflix four business days to counter. Netflix then said it would not raise its $82.7 billion all-cash bid for the legacy studio, and would walk away from the deal.\n\n“The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,” said Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters in a statement Thursday. “However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.”\n\nPer the terms of the original deal, Warner Bros. Discovery will have to pay a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix to end the existing agreement. Paramount’s renewed offer — backed by the world’s sixth-richest person, Oracle’s executive chair, and David Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison — includes paying that breakup fee.\n\nThe new deal will see Paramount, which was bought just last year by Ellison’s Skydance Media with heavy financial backing from his father, acquiring the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its studios, HBO, its streaming service, its games and entertainment divisions, and linear television networks like CNN, TBS, TNT, Discovery, and HGTV.\n\nEllison, whose Paramount already owns major studios, entertainment, and news businesses, has warned of significant job cuts. His ownership of news network CBS has also attracted controversy and has largely been seen as a sympathetic turn toward the Trump administration, with reporting critical of the administration shelved or facing increased scrutiny by Ellison and CBS’s editor-in-chief, the conservative provocateur Bari Weiss. Larry Ellison is a major donor and supporter of President Trump.\n\nNetflix had announced its intent to acquire WBD in December, offering nearly $83 billion for its studios and streaming service alone. Despite several hostile takeover bids by Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery reaffirmed to shareholders its belief that Netflix’s offer was superior to Paramount’s, which offered $108 billion for the full company including its linear television networks. Paramount’s newest bid, of $31 a share, values WBD at about $111 billion.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Jack Dorsey has long been an open admirer of Elon Musk. Now, it seems, he may have been taking notes.\n\nOn Thursday, Dorsey announced that Block, the payments company he founded that operates Square, Cash App, and Tidal, is cutting more than 4,000 employees, nearly half its global workforce, taking it from over 10,000 workers down to just under 6,000. Investors responded enthusiastically, sending the stock up more than 24% in after-hours trading.\n\nIt isn’t the first time a major tech company has done something of the sort. In November 2022, Musk slashed roughly 50% of Twitter’s staff in a single stroke after taking the company private, a move that rattled many in Silicon Valley and rewrote the unofficial rules for how far a CEO could go in one shot.\n\nDorsey was in an unusual position to watch it unfold. He’d rolled his roughly 2.4% ownership stake in Twitter into Musk’s takeover rather than taking a cash payout, making him one of the largest outside investors in what became X.\n\nThe two men have had one of tech’s stranger relationships, with warm words giving way to public shots, then back again. Dorsey championed Musk’s Twitter acquisition, then said Musk “should have walked away.” He helped launch Bluesky, the decentralized Twitter alternative, then quit its board and called X “freedom technology.” Both are also vocal Bitcoin advocates — Block and Tesla each carry the cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\n\nDorsey framed Thursday’s cuts as a proactive, even empathetic, choice, and not a financial emergency. (The 4,000 people losing their jobs may see it differently.) “Repeated rounds of cuts are destructive to morale, to focus, and to the trust that customers and shareholders place in our ability to lead,” he wrote on X. He predicted that within a year, most companies will arrive at the same place. “I’d rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively,” he said.\n\nThe cuts are being driven, at least officially, by AI. Block CFO Amrita Ahuja said the cuts will position the company to “move faster with smaller, highly talented teams using AI to automate more work.”\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

Some uses are also simply outside the bounds of what today’s technology can safely and reliably do.”\n\nThe two cases are: mass surveillance of Americans and fully autonomous weapons with no human in the loop. The Pentagon believes it should be able to use Anthropic’s model for all lawful purposes, and that its uses shouldn’t be dictated by a private company.\n\nAmodei’s statement comes less than 24 hours ahead of the Friday 5:01 p.m. deadline Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has given Anthropic to either acquiesce to his demands, or face the consequences. The Department of Defense has attempted to force Amodei’s hand by either labeling Anthropic a supply chain risk — a designation reserved for foreign adversaries — or invoke the Defense Production Act and effectively force the firm to do its bidding. The DPA gives the president the authority to force companies to prioritize or expand production for national defense.\n\nAmodei pointed out the contradiction in those two threats. “One labels us a security risk; the other labels Claude as essential to national security.”\n\nHe added that it’s the Department’s right to choose contractors most aligned with its vision, “but given the substantial value that Anthropic’s technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.”\n\nAnthropic is currently the only frontier AI lab that has classified-ready systems for the military, though the DOD is reportedly getting xAI ready for the job.\n\nTechcrunch event Save up to $300 or 30% to TechCrunch Founder Summit 1,000+ founders and investors come together at TechCrunch Founder Summit 2026 for a full day focused on growth, execution, and real-world scaling.

            "content": "Could Meta be preparing to launch a Prada version of its Meta AI glasses? That’s the speculation after Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla, were spotted sitting in the front row of Prada’s Fall/Winter 2026 Fashion Week show in Milan on Thursday. The social media exec was seen chatting with his seatmate, Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada’s chief merchandising officer and son of head designer Miuccia Prada.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg has been working to polish his image in recent years, including with upgraded threads, it’s likely that he wasn’t at Prada for the fashion, but rather because of an upcoming collaboration with the brand.\n\nCNBC reported last summer that Prada AI glasses were in the works, among others. However, Meta has yet to publicly announce such a deal. (The company has not yet responded to a request for comment about Zuckerberg’s presence in Milan.)\n\nSurprise guests at Prada pic.twitter.com/BPHqLo9oaW — Vanessa Friedman (@VVFriedman) February 26, 2026\n\nEssilorLuxottica, the French-Italian eyewear brand and Ray-Ban maker, has been working with Meta on these high-tech devices since their debut, initially under the Ray-Ban Stories brand. This month, the company announced it sold over 7 million AI glasses in 2025, up from 2 million in the prior year. Those sales included both Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta glasses, the latter designed more for the athletic types.\n\nNow, it seems, Prada AI glasses could be next, given that Prada and EssilorLuxottica already renewed their licensing deal for eyewear under the Prada and Miu Miu brands for the next ten years. (The existing agreement, which expired on December 31, 2025, was later extended through December 31, 2030, with the provision for renewal until December 31, 2035.)\n\nPrada AI glasses could give Meta a foothold in the high-fashion market, a niche that its Oakleys and Ray-Bans don’t yet fill. Establishing the glasses as a luxury symbol could also benefit Meta’s brand overall.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns that AI glasses aren’t the right fit for a world that’s seeing an increased consumer backlash against surveillance devices, which have recently led people to rip out their Ring doorbells and smash Flock cameras. This shift could see Meta reconsidering whether it will add facial-recognition features to its glasses, as The New York Times recently reported. The news drew criticism for what had otherwise been a modestly successful tech product and has even prompted one developer to build an app that will warn you if someone is wearing the AI glasses near you."

            "content": "Belt-drive bikes offer some huge upsides. First, they usually require less maintenance, with many belts often lasting twice as long as a typical chain. Second, there’s no grease to speak of, and therefore, no black smudges on your work pants. Third, in the case of the Soltera 3, the belt comes from the Gates brand, whose drivetrain belts are as good as it gets. Belt-drive bikes are silent and often smoother than their chain-driven counterparts.\n\nThat said, the inclusion of a low-maintenance element such as a belt drive paired with hydraulic disc brakes, which require bleeding roughly every year, struck me as an odd choice. If Aventon wanted to make the Soltera 3 as hands-off as possible, cable-actuated brakes would have been a more intuitive choice.\n\nThe other thing that immediately jumps out about the Soltera 3 is its relatively light weight. At 37 pounds, the Soltera 3 is heavy for an analog bike. But it’s certainly not heavy for an ebike, and it’s nearly as stiff, nimble, and navigable as a conventional bicycle. One issue I’ve always had with ebikes is their heft. Given that they’re often made to replace a car, they’re built with load bearing in mind. Also, ebike batteries are heavy.\n\nAdding to that sense of “this is just like my other bikes,” the Soltera 3 simply looks cool, which is often not the case when it comes to ebikes. The matte black my tester bike arrived in looks cool because matte black almost never doesn’t look cool. (Additionally, the Soltera 3 is available in dark matte blue and a sleek silver.) But beyond the finish, the bike’s geometry; its wide, almost perfectly flat handlebars; and its narrow (by ebike standards) 700 x 36 tires make it feel closer in DNA to a road bike than a traditional ebike.\n\nButton Press\n\nPhotograph: Michael Venutolo-Mantovani\n\nI’m 6′4′′, and the extra large Soltera 3 that I tested was at a maximum saddle height. It was suitable for me, but I couldn’t recommend anyone bigger than me riding the Soltera 3. That said, with four sizes ranging from small to extra large, the line covers a wide swath of riders, ranging from my height all the way down to 5′ tall."

            "content": "The new wave of AI-powered technologies have almost entirely taken over the apps and digital services we use every day, from photo editors to fitness trackers. There's even a notable AI app available for podcasts too. It’s called Huxe.\n\nAt the core of Huxe is a daily brief, a sort of personal productivity podcast tailored to your tastes and requirements, generated from the sources you pick. Connect up your calendar and email account, and every morning you get a quick audio summary to get you set for the day. The idea is that a 15-minute audio podcast can replace the much longer amount of time you'd otherwise spend trying to figure out what's happening with your inbox and your schedule.\n\nThe audio emphasis of Huxe is no surprise, as the team behind the app previously worked on Google NotebookLM, a research tool that has its own podcast-style Audio Overviews feature. Huxe is similar, but it draws information from your emails and calendar entries.\n\nThere's more to Huxe as well, including audio deep dives on any topic of your choice, as well as news summaries. The app is completely free to use right now, and you can sign up through the apps for Android or iOS.\n\nGetting Started\n\n***01-interests.jpg\n\nRegistering interests with Huxe.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nTo start taking advantage of Huxe’s personalized audio production powers, you need to tell it a little bit about yourself. As you work through the setup process, which includes supplying an email address and your name, you'll be prompted to connect your email and calendar accounts. (Google and Outlook accounts are both supported.)\n\nYou'll also be asked to choose a few topics that you're interested in from a list, generated by what's in your inbox and on your schedule—click Edit to make changes, and Add to add interests that Huxe hasn't picked up on yet. You can specify pretty much any topic you like, and Huxe will understand what you mean.\n\nWhen you get into the app proper, you are introduced to what are called livecasts, which are like radio stations for AI-generated speech content: For me, these livecasts have titles such as Big Tech Roundup, Today in AI, and Product Drops, which gives you some idea of what to expect. You can also get audio summaries about specific companies, such as Apple and Meta in my case.\n\n***02-deepcast.jpg\n\nDeepCasts can be created with a single text prompt.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nUsing the menu button in the top right corner, you can change your account settings and edit your interests, as well as change the voices used for the hosts of your daily brief. Via the + (plus) button in the lower right corner, you're able to generate a DeepCast (a deep dive) on the topic of your choosing, as well as your own live stations.\n\nI tried to get the app to give me a DeepCast on the history of the band R.E.M., and it produced a relatively insightful and perfectly accurate (if a little generic) 15-minute clip in just a few seconds. As with the Audio Overviews in NotebookLM, you get two AI characters talking to each other about the subject at hand, podcast-style.\n\nAs always with any app that connects to your email and calendar, you're trusting the developer to handle your data responsibly. The full Huxe privacy policy is here, and while there's obviously a lot of data recorded—which is what makes the daily briefing and the other features work—the company says it won't use any personally identifiable email or calendar data to train its AI models. According to the privacy policy, there’s still a possibility some of your data is being shared with third-party LLM and voice synthesis partners—each of which have their privacy policies—that help Huxe make your podcasts. So take a hard look at what sorts of sensitive things are in your email inbox and your calendar before handing over permissions.\n\nYour Daily Briefing\n\n***03-brief.jpg\n\nThe daily brief combines emails, news, and appointments.\n\n(David Nield)\n\nYou can wait for Huxe to deliver a briefing every morning (you'll get a notification when it's ready), or you can generate one right away by tapping the play button in the center of the app's home screen. These briefings typically include a summary of what's in your inbox, the latest news relevant to your interests, and the next events on your calendar."

            "content": "Blood pressure is simultaneously the least exciting yet one of the most important vital signs that a fitness tracker can measure. Unlike a pedometer or sports watch, it’s not going to incentivize you to get active. Unlike a continuous glucose monitor, it’s not going to help you lose weight. A gigantic blood pressure cuff isn’t exactly a gorgeous or enticing accessory to wear. In fact, getting your arm squeezed so tight can be downright claustrophobic.\n\nBut there’s a reason why blood pressure is one of the first tests you get at the doctor’s office. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is one of the top killers in the United States. It can result in conditions like heart attacks or strokes. There are usually no symptoms; hypertension is called “the silent killer” for a reason. Nearly one in three people worldwide has it. And unlike diseases like cancer, we already have simple, readily available tools to treat it, like exercise and reducing the amount of salt that you eat.\n\nLast year, a few fitness trackers debuted hypertension notifications in their suite of features—most notably, the Apple Watch. Unlike the Apple Watch, the Aktiia Hilo band does not merely notify you when you have signs of hypertension. It monitors your blood pressure up to 25 times a day, 24 hours a day. Aktiia reached out to me for testing when it launched; WIRED is the first in the United States to test it. This device could change many lives for the better when it goes on sale in the US later this year. (It's available now in some countries.)\n\nLight and Sound\n\nPhotograph: Adrienne So\n\nThe Aktiia Hilo comes in two parts—the slim, cuffless band you wear every day and a Bluetooth-enabled blood pressure cuff you use to calibrate the device every month or so. Both have to be connected to the Hilo app (iOS, Android). Once both are connected, the app will remind you to abstain from alcohol, caffeine, and exercise for at least 30 minutes beforehand and to sit and relax with your back supported for at least five minutes."

            "content": "When Netflix dropped the first season of Love Is Blind in February 2020, it offered a reprieve from the washboard abs that normally seem like a casting requirement for reality TV shows.\n\nThe premise—that couples get engaged “sight unseen” after talking to each other through pods, then, following a big reveal, decide if they want to get married—featured just the right amount of mess. Who can forget Jessica allowing her dog to sip wine or an insulted Carlton throwing his fiancee's engagement ring into a pool? Meanwhile Lauren and Cameron's unvarnished conversations highlighted the awkwardness that sometimes accompanies interracial dating.\n\nIt was a reality show, but it seemed like a format that could actually allow people to fall in love without getting bogged down in superficial distractions and expectations. Maybe.\n\nNow in its 10th season, Love Is Blind is a cornerstone of Netflix’s reality TV cinematic universe. But while each cycle brings us standout women who earnestly buy into the show’s original conceit, it’s getting tougher to find any men to root for.\n\nWith the latest US season featuring Chris Fusco, who voluntarily compares himself to Andrew Tate and derides a fellow male cast member for being “submissive,” and Alex Henderson, a Trump-loving crypto bro with an ever-shifting backstory, increasingly the men of Love Is Blind seem to have been plucked straight from the manosphere.\n\nSeason after season, the women on the show (and viewers at home) are subjected to men who make shallow, body-shaming comments, struggle with anger and emotional regulation, and sometimes appear uncomfortable with their partner’s success."

            "content": "In late December, the 21st to be exact, my friends Amos and Clara called me 17 times. On December 22 it was eight times. The calls were short—sometimes only 30 to 45 seconds, and they usually arrived when I was doing something important: working, grocery shopping, napping. “Hi Anna,” one or both of them would say. “Hi!” I’d respond. Sometimes I worried that I sounded too eager, or like I was just sitting around waiting for their call. Sometimes I felt a little pathetic.\n\nIf anyone else called me that often I’d block their number. But Amos is 6 years old, and Clara is 9, and what happened is that on December 20, for Hanukkah, the siblings got the gift of a newly released, extremely old-school kids’ phone. And for the next week or so, the two of them couldn’t stop calling. And I, for one, couldn’t stop picking up.\n\nCalled the Tin Can, the phone came out last April and has since sold more than 100,000 units without much paid advertising. It’s basically a “dumb phone” that makes and receives calls over a Wi-Fi network—a landline without the line. It has no screen, not even a tiny one to show who’s calling; its surface has only buttons, a receiver, and a speaker. The product is marketed to parents who want to encourage their children to communicate without giving them access to web browsers and social media. (One user on X suggested, jokingly, that children start writing chain letters next.)\n\nThe standard Tin Can, which comes in four colorways and costs $100, looks like a candy-colored soup can. A “retro” model called The Flashback appears nearly identical to an old-school cradle phone and also retails at $100. Calls between Tin Cans are free, but the company charges $10 a month for users to call outside the Tin Can network. Parents get to set the rules—they add numbers to an approved caller list, and only calls to and from those numbers go through, and only in preset time frames, say, between 8 am and 8 pm. Parents can also monitor call logs. Call it spying with the implied consent of the spied upon; an electronic surveillance state in miniature.\n\nSome parents have tried to solve the problem of intrusive screens by buying their kids smartwatches; others opt for typical dumb phones. But these products are more about letting adults keep tabs on where their kids are at any given moment. The Tin Can is more about getting kids to focus on using their voices to communicate.\n\nAnd that’s about it. Tin Cans don’t show you missed calls or support text messaging. In an era in which most everyone is being nudged toward addictive, screen-based, endless-scroll engagement, giving kids the opportunity to get lost in conversation can seem incredibly appealing to parents."

Each panel on the helmet has 12 red lights (120 total), which are on a spectrum of 620 to 660 nanometers (nm). The 620-nm red light helps improve scalp health by promoting circulation, and the 660-nm red light penetrates deeper, reaching through the epidermis and dermis to the hypodermis, where it stimulates growth and repair at the follicle root. According to CurrentBody, you only need to use the device for 10 minutes a day, and you’ll see results within 12 weeks.\n\nMy hair grows famously slow. I got a pixie cut in the spring of 2011, and my hair did not touch my shoulders until the end of 2013. My hair is also super fine. It tangles easily and often breaks off (my ends are chronically dry and split). After 12 weeks, I didn’t notice a huge difference in length (and I got a haircut halfway through testing), but I did notice that my hair seemed to be sprouting new follicles along my scalp and sideburn area in particular. I started to see small baby hairs along my hairline that I had never seen before. My stylist commented that my hair felt thicker, and I noticed less breakage and hair caught in bristles when brushing. My balding roommate also tested it (although not daily like me) and said that his hair felt thicker and that there was new growth around the scalp.\n\nThe helmet comes in two sizes: medium for a skull circumference of 21.3 to 23.2 inches, or large, for 23.3 to 25 inches. (I opted for medium, and it was too large for my head size.) The device sits on a base and is charged via a USB-C cord. It takes about three hours to fully charge, and it stays on a single charge for about a week. The device is powered on by the press of the single button located under the charging port. The circular earmuffs protect sensitive ears with a cushy, removable faux leather cloth, and they can be adjusted several inches up or down to ensure a comfortable fit. The screen on the right earmuff indicates the time left in the treatment session, and the helmet automatically turns off when the 10 minutes are up. You can also connect the device to Bluetooth and play any type of music or video while wearing it, because God forbid I be left alone with my thoughts for 10 minutes a day. Just make sure your hair is clean and dry before use.\n\nMy only complaints are that the ear covers aren’t the easiest to adjust while wearing and would oftentimes pull out my hair while I removed or adjusted the helmet. Nevertheless, this is the best red light therapy for hair growth. Just you wait, I’ll look like Fabio on the cover of a romance novel by next year. See full review here. —Molly Higgins"

            "content": "Congressional Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee say they’ve identified more than $20.9 billion in consumer losses tied to identity theft connected to four major breaches involving data broker firms. The estimate was released Friday in a minority report stemming from a months-long inquiry into data broker practices launched by United States senator Maggie Hassan.\n\nHassan, a New Hampshire Democrat and the JEC’s ranking member, sent investigative requests to five major data brokers—Comscore, Findem, IQVIA Digital, Telesign, and 6Sense Insights—in August after an investigation by The Markup and CalMatters, copublished by WIRED, found some data brokers were hiding opt-out tools from Google and other search engines using “no index” instructions that tell web crawlers not to list the page.\n\nScammers are shown to use the kind of sensitive data that companies like these hold—including identifiers like dates of birth, addresses, and even Social Security numbers—to target victims with personalized fraud.\n\nFour of the companies took steps after Hassan’s outreach to improve access to opt-out options, including by removing the “no index” code, adding more prominent links, and posting guidance on exercising privacy rights.\n\nFindem, however, did not respond to Hassan or to committee staff follow-up, and staff said the company has not removed the “no index” code from its page. WIRED’s calls to Findem on Thursday went unanswered.\n\nThe report says Findem’s “failure to respond” to the lawmakers’ inquiries raises “serious, broad questions about its responsiveness to opt-out requests and commitment to data privacy,” adding that its own mandatory disclosures from 2024 show the company “did not process 80 percent of privacy requests from consumers and other parties,” citing “insufficient data.”\n\nIQVIA, 6sense, and Comscore did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Telesign routes press inquiries through an online form that requires reporters to consent to receiving marketing communications, which was not used for that reason; instead, a company email address that appeared in previously leaked breach data was tried.\n\nThe Markup/CalMatters investigation found that dozens of California-registered data brokers were using the “no index” code and other so-called dark patterns that make opt-out and deletion pages harder to find. “In doing so,” the JEC minority report says, “the companies made it more difficult for people to protect their information from scammers.”\n\nComscore told the committee it reviewed its website after receiving Hassan’s request and found that its “Data Subject Rights” page—which directs users to separate forms for submitting opt-out requests—contained a “no index” code. The company said it traced the code, which it removed, back to an earlier version of the page created in 2003. The report says the company could not determine why it was added, but suggested it was “not intended to prevent consumer access.”\n\nTelesign confirmed that its opt-out form, hosted on a “Privacy Request” page, was not appearing in search results at the time of the Markup/CalMatters reporting; it attributed the issue to a third-party SEO tool that restricts visibility by default, and says it has now enabled indexing and added a footer link to the form.\n\nJEC staff say Telesign’s approach still forces consumers to look beyond its main site and, even where links exist, they’re often buried on pages users wouldn’t reasonably think to check—including privacy notice pages exceeding 9,000 words.\n\n6sense disputed that its main “Privacy Center” was hidden, but acknowledged that its “Privacy Policy” page—which links to opt-out tools—previously carried “no index” code, adding that it removed the code after the Markup/CalMatters report. 6sense was the only company to report using third-party audits to assess both the visibility of opt-out options and whether the requests are being successfully processed, the report says."

            "content": "Finding an inexpensive, quality inkjet printer isn't a challenge. But getting affordable replacement ink is another matter entirely.\n\nYou might be shocked to learn that replacement ink cartridges can cost as much as the printer itself, if not more. It's because printers are often sold at a loss, with the company expecting to make its profit on the ink.\n\nThis strategy, also known as the \"razor-and-blades model,\" is common in consumer goods, including printers, coffee makers (the ones that use disposable pods) and its namesake, shaving razors.\n\nPrinter manufacturers, however, claim there are several reasons why ink costs so much, beyond revenue. Here are the main reasons why printer ink is so expensive.\n\nThe razor blade business\n\nThe razor-and-blade business model provides a continued revenue stream for printer-makers after a customer buys the hardware. It also locks that customer into an ecosystem. Just as some razor handles are compatible with only a specific blade, printers support only certain inkjet or toner cartridges.\n\nManufacturers typically offer different printer models, but they likely use different cartridges that aren't interchangeable. The cartridges also aren't refillable by design. While it may seem manipulative, this business model is legal and common practice. It also keeps prices high due to a lack of competition.\n\nIt's all proprietary (aka intellectual property)\n\nThanasi/Getty\n\nAnother way consumers are locked into a closed ecosystem is that many ink and toner cartridges contain chipsets that communicate with the printer, such as the amount of ink or toner left, so the printer can estimate how many pages it can print. They also verify whether the cartridge is authentic (i.e., from the printer manufacturer) or has been refilled. In either case, the printer could reject the cartridge.\n\nWhile some third-party suppliers have found ways around this, printer cartridges are proprietary, the intellectual property of the original manufacturer. Customers are usually limited in replacement options other than buying from their printer's original equipment manufacturer.\n\nThis isn't about the cost of research and manufacturing, or at least, not just about that. Printer-makers claim that their technology ensures consumers get the best print quality from their ink or toner, as well as proper performance and accurate color or monochrome prints.\n\nFor example, inkjet printer ink is formulated to flow smoothly through the tiny printhead nozzles, while laser printer toner powder must be heated and applied evenly. That ink or toner also has to dry quickly on paper without smudging, which is another key reason. The official cartridges also include security features that manufacturers claim protect against malware.\n\nSo, although cartridges look simple on the outside, their embedded technology adds to manufacturing costs. Companies say this helps ensure high print quality, but consumer advocacy groups say it is designed to keep out competition while shifting the cost to users.\n\nIf you print often, expect to spend more on consumables\n\nGettyimages/Photoplus magazine\n\nObviously, the more ink or toner used, the sooner replenishment is needed. This is especially the case with inkjet printers, as cartridges often contain a low yield of ink (between 150 to 300 pages). And, if the printer uses multiple cartridges, those costs add up quickly. If you run out of one color, you might not even be able to print black-and-white documents.\n\nWorse, new inkjet printers include \"starter ink cartridges\" that offer even lower yields. Laser printer toner cartridges also require replacing, but they tend to have higher yields than their inkjet counterparts.\n\nAlso, if you don't print often, the ink in the cartridges can dry out, requiring replacement before you can print anything.\n\nHow to reduce printer ink costs\n\nEpson/CNET\n\nThere's no way around it: Inkjet printers need ink, which will eventually run out. But there are a few ways to save some money.\n\nHigh-yield cartridges\n\nSome printers support high-yield ink or toner cartridges, which double the output of standard options. They cost a bit more, but you may be able to reduce the frequency of ink replacements. They also might be cheaper per page printed.\n\nRefillable ink\n\nRefillable inkjet printers, also known as supertank printers, have gained popularity. As the name suggests, a user pours ink into tanks built into the printer, much like refilling a soap bottle. Refillable inks are cheaper than ink cartridges and offer a much higher yield. (They also produce less waste in general.) However, the printers themselves are more expensive to purchase upfront.\n\nHP\n\nSubscription programs\n\nHP offers its Instant Ink program, which automatically ships you a replacement when ink runs low (the printer sends this info to HP when connected to Wi-Fi). Starting at $1.79 a month, HP sends new high-yield cartridges only when needed and recycles your old cartridges to reduce e-waste. HP says Instant Ink offers a savings of up to 50% when compared to buying off the shelf, and most Wi-Fi-enabled HP printers support the program.\n\nEpson launched a new service called ReadyPrint, where, for a monthly fee (starting at $15), you get a printer and unlimited refillable ink. ReadyPrint is available only on select models.\n\nPrint in draft mode and limit color\n\nOftentimes, lower-quality draft mode is more than sufficient for most print jobs. This can help increase page yields. Nearly all inkjet printers can output in color, but that doesn't mean you should. Make sure you disable color in your print settings and enable it only when needed.\n\nConsider a laser printer\n\nLaser toner cartridge. Getty Images/Smith Collection\n\nEvaluate the amount and type of printing you plan to do. If it's mostly black-and-white documents, it may be more economical to invest in a laser printer, since toner offers higher yields and doesn't dry out between infrequent uses.\n\nThen, if you need to occasionally print color or photos, print them professionally at FedEx, pharmacies like CVS and any number of local or online photo print shops. In the long run, this might be cheaper than owning your own color printer if you don't print regularly.\n\nThird-party supplies\n\nThird-party ink supplies can offer significant savings, but printer manufacturers have strongly fought against this option. They've even implemented measures to prevent their use. However, it's not illegal for consumers to use third-party inks. Before you choose this option, know that the savings may come at the cost of print quality, and some third-party inks could damage the hardware.\n\nWhile using third-party ink won't void the warranty, the printer manufacturer may not cover repairs or replacements if third-party supplies are found to be the source of damage. It's best to choose a reputable retailer or service known for high-quality third-party inks, and that will stand behind them."

            "content": "If you thought sponge colors were just for aesthetic appeal, you'd only be partly correct. The bright pink, yellow, blue and green hues they come in signal how and when to use them.\n\nUse the wrong sponge on the wrong surface, and you could end up with some hopelessly scratched appliances or damaged cookware. It took me 40 years to stumble upon this information, and it explains the unsightly scratches dotting my stovetop and fridge.\n\nThis guide is to help you avoid a similar fate.\n\nSponges are color-coded for reason. Robin Mosley/CNET\n\nLearning to decode these colors can also help prevent cross-contamination. Designating certain sponges for cleaning up bacterial messes, such as poultry spills, will keep that dangerous stuff from seeping into something untoward.\n\nHere's how to pick a sponge based on color and protect your fragile home appliances and kitchen surfaces.\n\nGreen\n\nIntended use: An all-purpose workhorse\n\nGreen sponges are tough and versatile -- too tough for stainless-steel appliances. Scotch-Brite\n\nThese scouring pads are the workhorse of the home cleaning world: multipurpose, dependable and ready to tackle just about anything.\n\nOften designated for general cleaning and dishwashing, they offer enough scrubbing power to remove midrange residue but can also handle tougher stains or even outdoor cleaning tasks. Basically, if you're not sure which sponge to grab, green means go.\n\nThey're too rough for glass, stainless steel and other sensitive surfaces, but for caked-on cast iron and a filthy fridge, nothing works quite as well.\n\nYellow:\n\nIntended use: Medium coarseness for sensitive surfaces\n\nYellow sponges are meant for more sensitive surfaces, including nonstick cookware. Mr. Scrub\n\nYellow sponges are right in the middle -- not too rough, not too soft but often overlooked. They represent a step down in abrasiveness from green. They are suitable for cleaning more delicate surfaces, such as glassware, countertops and kitchen sinks, which require careful treatment to avoid scratches but still develop significant stains and buildup.\n\nBlue\n\nIntended use: A softy for glass and stainless steel\n\nA blue sponge will coddle your most delicate wares. Lavex\n\nWhen you're dealing with delicate surfaces, reach for a blue sponge. It's the least abrasive option and is ideal for very delicate surfaces such as glass or stainless steel, where a scratch-free shine is the goal. Blue is basically the spa day of sponges -- gentle, calming and leaves everything looking refreshed.\n\nRed and pink\n\nIntended use: High-risk areas and bacterial messes\n\nReserve red sponges for bacterial mess. The Home Depot\n\nThese colors are typically reserved for the danger zones, such as cleaning tougher, baked-on food or areas that pose a higher bacterial risk, like the sink where you just rinsed raw chicken (you know, your kitchen's version of a crime scene).\n\nTheir color is less an indication of their coarseness than a visual reminder to never, ever use them on clean tableware, unless you enjoy living dangerously.\n\nAnd because they're often employed in hazardous jobs, you may want to stock up on a bundle and simply toss them more often than their counterparts in alternative colors.\n\nBlack:\n\nIntended use: Heavy-duty scrubbing\n\nJetz Scrubz\n\nThese highly abrasive, heavy-duty sponges are for serious scrubbing of stubborn, baked-on stains on tough surfaces. You might not go through them as often as the others, but for certain gnarly cleaning jobs, only the bristly black sponge will suffice.\n\nHow color-coding sponges reduces the risk of contamination\n\nUsing sponges strategically will reduce wear on kitchen surfaces. SimpleImages/Getty\n\nA systematic approach to kitchen hygiene often involves color-coding cleaning tools to ensure proper organization and cleanliness. This simple, visual system ensures a sponge used only for heavily soiled areas (or biohazard jobs) is never mistakenly used on clean glassware, silverware or plates. Because trust us, your guests will notice.\n\nBy establishing and following this clear color-coded system, you can reduce the spread of germs, keep your kitchen safer and ensure that your most delicate items are treated with the gentlest care. Plus, you'll finally have a legitimate reason to own a rainbow of colorful sponges.\n\nFor more cleaning tips, see a former custodian's tips for cleaning the bathroom like a pro and discover which all-purpose cleaner fared the best in our testing."

If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission.\n\nOne of the most significant improvements to TV picture quality has been the introduction of OLED technology. An OLED TV can create perfect black levels with infinite contrast, as well as excellent color and great motion control. It's a technology that lends itself well to sports, gaming on consoles or watching HDR TV shows and movies. I have tested the latest OLED TVs side-by-side in the CNET TV lab, including brands such as LG, Sony, Samsung and Panasonic. These are the models I recommend.\n\n\n\nThe best OLED TV\n\nThe best OLED TV for most users is the Samsung S90F TV as it's got both picture quality and affordability in equal measure, especially now that prices have come down. That said, the LG C5 is also an excellent TV at a similar price, and as a result you should buy whichever of the two models is cheapest at the time.\n\nIf you can spend more and want the best possible picture quality that you can get, then it's a choice between the LG G5 and the Samsung S95F. The LG TV is the most color accurate TV I tested in 2025 and the winner of a CNET Labs Award, while the Samsung is excellent in both the dark and in bright rooms.\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best OLED TV value of 2026 Samsung S90F 8.6 /10 SCORE It's a close call between the Samsung S90F and LG C5, as always at this level, but given the Samsung S90F is slightly better and around the same money it's the one to choose. The Samsung has similar picture quality to its more-expensive S95F sibling and that's the best reason to buy it. The Samsung also has most of the features you need including 4K/120Hz gaming support, HDR 10+ and onboard streaming. While the TV doesn't have Dolby Vision, the differences between HDR10+ and Dolby's HDR format are subtle at best. ... Show more Get it now $1,098 at Amazon Learn more Samsung S90F review\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Best overall OLED performance Samsung S95F 8.9 /10 SCORE Unless you live in a hermetically-sealed container, you are likely to have a bunch of different light sources competing with your TV in your living space. Overhead lights and windows can wreak havoc on your picture, and it's not always feasible to close the curtains or turn the lights off. The Samsung S95F is the best TV I've seen to effectively ban reflections, and the fact that it gives excellent picture quality as well makes it the ultimate TV for the movies or gaming fan who likes to watch during the day. ... Show more Get it now $2,497 at Amazon Learn more Samsung S95F review\n\nTy Pendlebury/CNET Photo Gallery 1/1 Ty Pendlebury/CNET Brightest, best color accuracy of 2026 LG G5 LG G5 Buy Now 8.8 /10 SCORE LG's G series has shown appreciable improvements in picture quality every year, and the 2025 G5 is brighter than ever before. It's neck-and-neck with the S95F for picture quality in terms of contrast and color, though the LG is demonstrably more accurate, with the best color accuracy score of the past year. Plus, the G5 is a blast to game on. I still like the S95F a little better, and that's mainly because of Samsung's reflection deterrence. ... Show more Get it now $1,877 at Amazon Learn more LG G5 review\n\nRecent updates Feb. 26, 2025: Added CNET Labs Award to LG G5 and updated pricing. Dec. 11, 2025: Added the Samsung S90F as the best value pick, and removed the 2024 LG C4. Oct. 2, 2025: Updated the list with new TVs including the Samsung S95F and the LG G5, plus added more information on my testing process.\n\nI also tested Panasonic Z95A: It boasts excellent picture quality, thanks to OLED, and it also includes a dedicated speaker system. It's being replaced by the Z95B but it's still available in some stores. Read my hands-on of the Panasonic Z95B. LG C5: While the LG G5 is a huge leap from the model that came before it, the C5 is more incremental. That said, it is still an improvement and if it's the same price as the C4 then get this instead. See my full review of the LG C5.\n\nFactors to consider when choosing an OLED TV Carly Marsh/CNET Screen size: OLEDs are available in sizes from 42 inches to 97 inches, and there are probably even bigger TVs coming in the future. One of the best pieces of advice I can give is, if you can afford it, always buy a TV one size bigger than you think you need. While 65 inches is the norm right now, TVs will keep getting bigger year after year, and you might consider buying a 77-inch to prevent an upgrade in the near future. However, if you're buying for a bedroom or a game room, then you could look at TVs 55 inches or less. Consider older models: At the affordable end of OLED, the yearly model updates aren't as dramatic when compared with the flagships. For TVs like the LG B5 or even C5, for instance, it makes sense to compare prices on last year's model and get whichever is cheapest. In the meantime, as we progress into the new year you're going to see the prices of 2025 models continue to drop. HDR formats: While it's not completely necessary, compatibility with Dolby Vision is a plus. Of course, Samsung doesn't support the Dolby format and instead offers its own version it calls HDR10 plus, and this is gaining in popularity. In the end, though, almost every 4K TV supports HDR 10, and this will work just fine. Gaming: If you're a gamer then having gaming-enhancing features is a bonus, and these includes a dedicated gaming mode (for turning off processing and reducing lag), 120Hz or higher support and even gaming apps such as Xbox Game Pass, Amazon Luna and Steam Link. Operating system: With the introduction of the Philips Roku TV, you have a choice of all of the best smart TV interfaces on OLED televisions. Whether it's Google TV, Fire TV or one of the manufacturer-specific systems, opting for a popular smart TV interface gives you the most choice with apps and on-demand content."
